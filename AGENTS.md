- **Obi Nwosu** (42→57) - Former Lagos District infrastructure manager; spent nine years (Years 1-10) managing water treatment and critical systems for 5 million people, fighting collapse daily; Year 10 quit when futility became unbearable—maintaining infrastructure for people who'll all die felt like elaborate denial; stayed in Lagos Years 10-11, isolated and bitter, unable to stop seeing everything as pointless; Year 11 Month 10 began attending Kenji's Lagos teaching circle (two months before Wei's death) but remained deeply resistant—arms crossed, skeptical, silent for months; Year 12 Month 3 finally erupts during Lagos session, calls teaching "bullshit" and "spiritual bypassing," argues presence is just surrender for people too tired to rage; forces Kenji into defensive reaction, then watches him recover and admit uncertainty; that honesty cracks something—realizes he came seeking, not to destroy; Year 12 Month 4 returns, begins speaking occasionally, still challenging but constructively; Year 12-14 gradual transformation in Lagos—skepticism becomes discernment, resistance becomes honest questioning; relocates to Antarctica Year 14 (part of general migration wave); Year 14-15 becomes valuable voice in Antarctica circle, asks questions others afraid to ask, names doubts others hide; teaches that doubt and practice aren't opposites—can practice presence while uncertain it matters; his engineering mind recognizes maintenance as meditation (connects with David Chen's arrays, both understand maintaining what ends); embodies intelligent resistance transformed into engaged uncertainty, the skeptic who stays, and the wisdom that questioning presence is itself a form of presence; never becomes true believer, but becomes true practitioner—showing up despite doubt, practicing despite uncertainty, teaching that you don't need faith to be present.

## Thematic Core
Buddhist philosophy meets hard SF: impermanence, presence, meaning without permanence, acceptance without resignation. Everything was always temporary—the asteroid just makes it visible.

## Writing Style & Constraints
- **Hard science fiction** - Realistic physics, no miracle solutions
- **Present tense, close third person** - Intimate, immediate
- **Chapter structure**: POV character name | Year X, Month Y | Location
- **Contemplative pacing** - More philosophy than action
- **Each chapter**: ~4,000-4,500 words typically

## Current Status (as of context)
- **Parts I & II**: Complete (25 chapters, including new Ch 10: Before and Ch 13: Traces)
- **Part III**: 22 chapters written (26-47); includes new Ch 27: Reckoning, Ch 36: Breaking, plus 4 Maya POV chapters
- **Part IV**: 13 chapters written (48-60); includes new Ch 50: Gathering, Ch 57: Last Office
- **Active work area**: Revision and polish

## File Conventions
- All content is Markdown (`.md` files only)
- Chapter files: `##-title.md` (e.g., `01-calculation.md`)
- Outlines use clear structure with chapter summaries, POV, word counts, key beats

## Important Notes
- **Timeline precision matters** - Track character ages and years carefully
- **Character arcs span 15 years** - Respect growth/change trajectories
- **Wei dies Year 11** - Before final convergence (natural death at 125 years old, not impact)
- **Elena's arc**: Elected mayor → Unopposed → Witness (governance to presence)
- **Antarctica = megacity** - 4 billion at peak; climate forced migration
- **Ibrahim's timeline**: Wounded Year 2, arrives Antarctica Year 3 Month 2, unemployed Years 3-7, starts solar array work Year 7 Month 3, begins adaptive swimming Year 7 Month 10 (Derek's program), competent at both by Year 8; swimming becomes parallel practice to array maintenance—both embodied presence, both adaptive capability with broken body
- **David's work history**: Solar array maintenance since before detection (~Year -1); 9+ years by Year 8
- **Marcus Reyes arc**: Elena's assistant Years -6 to 2 (8 years service), leaves Antarctica Year 2 for Mumbai, teaches refugee children Years 3-15, maintains quarterly correspondence with Elena, encounters Kenji in Mumbai Year 5, returns to Antarctica Year 15 Month 1 (final 3 months), helps teach with Ibrahim and Kenji, witnesses end with chosen family
- **Two Marcuses**: Marcus Reyes (assistant, then Mumbai teacher) vs. Marcus Rivera (opponent, then deputy mayor) - both the same age, different journeys, both Elena's chosen family

- **Kenji's Physical Practices**: Tokyo Year 1-2: zazen and kinhin (walking meditation) intellectualized, not embodied; Mumbai Year 5: yoga/asana analyzed instead of felt; realizes pattern across cities—using body to achieve mental state instead of presence through action; Lagos Year 8: Wei's garden work finally teaches embodied presence—watering plants requires being here, not trying to be present; breakthrough understanding that presence emerges from task, not from seeking presence
- **Maya's Four POV Chapters**: Ch 37 (Awakening - age 13, Buddha's encounter with death), Ch 42 (Questions - age 15, doubt phase), Ch 44 (Deepening - age 16, first teaching), Ch 46 (Readiness - age 17, rage and gratitude before migration); shows her journey from encountering death to embracing presence; 2 years 8 months total practice (Year 11 M8 to Year 15 M4)
- **Daniel Okonkwo arc**: Side character making violence/suicide statistics visceral; Year 2: kills friend Raj Patel with rebar over food during District 7 riot, sentenced to 15 years; Marcus Reyes advocates pardon before leaving, Elena refuses; Year 4: Marcus Rivera challenges her decision; Year 6: Elena visits prison, sees his three children (mother died Year 3 suicide), 200+ unanswered letters to victim's widow; Year 10: Wei's letter about mercy prompts reflection; Year 11: Kenji's return surfaces unresolved guilt; Year 13 M9: Prison guard helps Daniel's cellmate (release date one day after impact) escape, finds the absurdity unbearable, abandons post; Daniel refuses to leave despite open cell, stays to serve his time, still consumed by guilt; Year 14 M8: Daniel commits suicide (wants to die present, not guilty); Year 15: Elena learns of death in Ch 55, realizes mercy would have been wiser than justice—forgiveness too late; thematic exploration of justice vs. mercy, consequence vs. compassion when time is short, absurdity of institutional time when all time ends
- **Linnea Andersson arc**: Side character making drug/addiction crisis visceral; Swedish biologist (studied trees), age 22 Year 0; meets Kenji at Lagos party Day 72, both using substances; Kenji encounters her Mumbai Year 5 (deep addiction, refugee quarter); part of Ibrahim's community Years 8-11 (Min-seo, Derek, Fatima help keep her alive); Ibrahim brings her to Kenji's teaching Year 11-12; begins recovery through presence practice; embodies hope that transformation possible even after years of addiction; human face of 520% increase in drug deaths; represents path Kenji escaped and later helps heal
