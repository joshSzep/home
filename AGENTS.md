## Project Overview
**Home** is a philosophical hard science fiction novel about humanity's final 15 years after detecting an unstoppable extinction asteroid. Set in Earth 3025, it explores how people face the end when there's no escape—a meditation on impermanence, meaning, and presence.

5. **Kenji Torres** (22→37) - Elena's son; philosophical seeker turned presence teacher
6. **Ibrahim al-Rashid** (19→34) - Muslim fighter whose faith shatters; finds small peace in maintenance

## Key Relationships
- Amara & Zara: Sisters, estranged Years 0-7, reconnect Year 7+
- Amara & David: Married, divorce Year 4, reconnecting Year 8+
- David & Ibrahim: Work colleagues on solar arrays, Year 7+ (David veteran, Ibrahim new hire)
- Ibrahim's refugee community: Min-seo (Korean elder, mint gardener), Derek (former US Marine), Fatima (Jordanian, faithful host) - kept him alive Years 6-15
- Zara's Lagos compound community: Mr. Okonkwo (elderly farmer, rooftop gardens), Adanna (fierce mother, defender of life-choice) & Samuel (her son, 20 at impact), Tom (engineer, water systems), Ling (Wei's caregiver) - Years 0-15, Adanna and Samuel come to Antarctica for final week
- Zara's family: Kwame (husband), Maya (17), Kofi (14 at impact)
- Elena & Kenji: Mother-son; both learn presence through crisis
- Wei: Teacher to multiple characters (Zara, Kenji, others)

## Thematic Core
Buddhist philosophy meets hard SF: impermanence, presence, meaning without permanence, acceptance without resignation. Everything was always temporary—the asteroid just makes it visible.

## Writing Style & Constraints
- **Hard science fiction** - Realistic physics, no miracle solutions
- **Present tense, close third person** - Intimate, immediate
- **Chapter structure**: POV character name | Year X, Month Y | Location
- **Contemplative pacing** - More philosophy than action
- **Each chapter**: ~4,000-4,500 words typically

## Current Status (as of context)
- **Parts I & II**: Complete (23 chapters)
- **Part III**: 2 of 16 chapters written (24-25)
- **Part IV**: Detailed outline exists; none written yet
- **Active work area**: Part III (Chapters 26-39)

## File Conventions
- All content is Markdown (`.md` files only)
- Chapter files: `##-title.md` (e.g., `01-calculation.md`)
- Outlines use clear structure with chapter summaries, POV, word counts, key beats

## Important Notes
- **Timeline precision matters** - Track character ages and years carefully
- **Character arcs span 15 years** - Respect growth/change trajectories
- **Wei dies Year 14** - Before final convergence (natural death, not impact)
- **Elena's arc**: Elected mayor → Unopposed → Witness (governance to presence)
- **Antarctica = megacity** - 4 billion at peak; climate forced migration
- **Ibrahim's timeline**: Wounded Year 2, arrives Antarctica Year 3 Month 2, unemployed Years 3-7, starts solar array work Year 7, competent by Year 8
- **David's work history**: Solar array maintenance since before detection (~Year -1); 9+ years by Year 8

## Collaboration Guidelines
When working on chapters or outlines:
1. Check "Complete Chapter Outline" section above for chapter placement and summary
2. Verify character ages using timeline (Year X - birth year)
3. Maintain thematic consistency (presence, impermanence, meaning)
4. Match existing chapter format and style
5. Respect character voice and established arcs
6. Cross-reference existing chapters for continuity
