## Project Overview
**Home** is a philosophical hard science fiction novel about humanity's final 15 years after detecting an unstoppable extinction asteroid. Set in Earth 3025, it explores how people face the end when there's no escape—a meditation on impermanence, meaning, and presence.

8. **Maya Okafor-Mensah** (born Year -2, POV in Part IV) - Zara's daughter; dies at 17 years 7 months

## Key Side Characters (Selected)
- **Asha Marin** (40→55) - Mixed-media extinction-era artist; uses religious and state imagery to expose how people project meaning onto symbols; insists that art is a mirror, not an answer; moves from global notoriety to quiet presence in Antarctica, where her late installations force characters to notice who they become in front of unsettling images.
- **Dr. Yuki Tanaka** (38→53) - Japanese-Nigerian pediatrician; Maya and Kofi's doctor Lagos Years 0-15; trained Tokyo, specialized in child development; asteroid makes her entire specialty (growth toward adulthood) absurd; Years 0-2 struggles with purposelessness; Years 3-5 learns presence medicine from observing Zara's Wei-influenced parenting; Years 6+ becomes informal teacher to other pediatricians, transforms practice from outcomes to witness; treats children of suicide victims (possibly Daniel Okonkwo's three kids), riot injuries, migration trauma; her childlessness by choice becomes poignant—never wanted her own children, now all dying children are hers; embodies Amara's mortality statistics made visceral through clinical practice.

## Key Relationships
- Amara & Zara: Sisters, estranged Years 0-7, reconnect Year 7+

- Zara's family: Kwame (husband), Maya (17), Kofi (14 at impact)
- Dr. Yuki Tanaka & Zara's family: Maya and Kofi's pediatrician Years 0-15; well-child visits become existential (tracking development toward no future); observes Zara's presence-focused parenting influenced by Wei; learns from Zara's approach rather than teaching it; possibly attends Wei's garden teachings Years 3+; professional witness to both children's complete lives

## Thematic Core
Buddhist philosophy meets hard SF: impermanence, presence, meaning without permanence, acceptance without resignation. Everything was always temporary—the asteroid just makes it visible.

## Writing Style & Constraints
- **Hard science fiction** - Realistic physics, no miracle solutions
- **Present tense, close third person** - Intimate, immediate
- **Chapter structure**: POV character name | Year X, Month Y | Location
- **Contemplative pacing** - More philosophy than action
- **Each chapter**: ~4,000-4,500 words typically

## Current Status (as of context)
- **Parts I & II**: Complete (24 chapters, including new Ch 12: Traces)
- **Part III**: 3 of 20 chapters written (25-27); includes 4 new Maya POV chapters (34, 39, 41, 43)
- **Part IV**: Detailed outline exists; none written yet
- **Active work area**: Part III (Chapters 28-44)

## File Conventions
- All content is Markdown (`.md` files only)
- Chapter files: `##-title.md` (e.g., `01-calculation.md`)
- Outlines use clear structure with chapter summaries, POV, word counts, key beats

## Important Notes
- **Timeline precision matters** - Track character ages and years carefully
- **Character arcs span 15 years** - Respect growth/change trajectories
- **Wei dies Year 11** - Before final convergence (natural death at 125 years old, not impact)
- **Elena's arc**: Elected mayor → Unopposed → Witness (governance to presence)
- **Antarctica = megacity** - 4 billion at peak; climate forced migration
- **Ibrahim's timeline**: Wounded Year 2, arrives Antarctica Year 3 Month 2, unemployed Years 3-7, starts solar array work Year 7, competent by Year 8
- **David's work history**: Solar array maintenance since before detection (~Year -1); 9+ years by Year 8
- **Marcus Reyes arc**: Elena's assistant Years -6 to 2 (8 years service), leaves Antarctica Year 2 for Mumbai, teaches refugee children Years 3-15, maintains quarterly correspondence with Elena, encounters Kenji in Mumbai Year 5, returns to Antarctica Year 15 Month 1 (final 3 months), helps teach with Ibrahim and Kenji, witnesses end with chosen family
- **Two Marcuses**: Marcus Reyes (assistant, then Mumbai teacher) vs. Marcus Rivera (opponent, then deputy mayor) - both the same age, different journeys, both Elena's chosen family
- **Ten Ox-Herding Pictures**: Zen teaching introduced Ch 12 (Tokyo, Year 2 M11); maps Kenji's journey: Pic 1 (seeking-Ch11), Pic 2 (traces-Ch12), Pic 3 (glimpsing-Ch19), Pic 4 (catching-Ch27), Pic 5 (taming-Ch29), Pic 6-7 (riding/ox forgotten-Ch36), Pic 8 (self forgotten-Ch48), Pic 9 (returning to source-Ch53), Pic 10 (marketplace-Ch55); teaching transmitted to Maya; novel's title "Home" = Picture 9
- **Maya's Four POV Chapters** (NEW): Ch 34 (Awakening - age 13, Buddha's encounter with death), Ch 39 (Questions - age 15, doubt phase), Ch 41 (Deepening - age 16, first teaching), Ch 43 (Readiness - age 17, rage and gratitude before migration); shows her journey from encountering death to embracing presence; 2 years 8 months total practice (Year 11 M8 to Year 15 M4)
- **Daniel Okonkwo arc**: Side character making violence/suicide statistics visceral; Year 2: kills friend Raj Patel with rebar over food during District 7 riot, sentenced to 15 years; Marcus Reyes advocates pardon before leaving, Elena refuses; Year 4: Marcus Rivera challenges her decision; Year 6: Elena visits prison, sees his three children (mother died Year 3 suicide), 200+ unanswered letters to victim's widow; Year 10: Wei's letter about mercy prompts reflection; Year 11: Kenji's return surfaces unresolved guilt; Year 13 M9: Prison guard helps Daniel's cellmate (release date one day after impact) escape, finds the absurdity unbearable, abandons post; Daniel refuses to leave despite open cell, stays to serve his time, still consumed by guilt; Year 14 M8: Daniel commits suicide (wants to die present, not guilty); Year 15: Elena learns of death in Ch 51, realizes mercy would have been wiser than justice—forgiveness too late; thematic exploration of justice vs. mercy, consequence vs. compassion when time is short, absurdity of institutional time when all time ends
- **Linnea Andersson arc**: Side character making drug/addiction crisis visceral; Swedish biologist (studied trees), age 22 Year 0; meets Kenji at Lagos party Day 72, both using substances; Kenji encounters her Mumbai Year 5 (deep addiction, refugee quarter); part of Ibrahim's community Years 8-11 (Min-seo, Derek, Fatima help keep her alive); Ibrahim brings her to Kenji's teaching Year 11-12; begins recovery through presence practice; embodies hope that transformation possible even after years of addiction; human face of 520% increase in drug deaths; represents path Kenji escaped and later helps heal

## Collaboration Guidelines
When working on chapters or outlines:
1. Check "Complete Chapter Outline" section above for chapter placement and summary
2. Verify character ages using timeline (Year X - birth year)
3. Maintain thematic consistency (presence, impermanence, meaning)
4. Match existing chapter format and style
5. Respect character voice and established arcs
6. Cross-reference existing chapters for continuity
