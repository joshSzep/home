## Project Overview
**Home** is a philosophical hard science fiction novel about humanity's final 15 years after detecting an unstoppable extinction asteroid. Set in Earth 3025, it explores how people face the end when there's no escape—a meditation on impermanence, meaning, and presence.

## Repository Structure
- **`Home/`** - Main novel content (chapters organized by part)
  - `Part I: Detection/` - Chapters 1-9 (Year 0) - 9 chapters complete
  - `Part II: Fracture/` - Chapters 10-23 (Years 1-7) - 14 chapters complete  
  - `Part III: Searching/` - Chapters 24-39 (Years 8-12) - 2 chapters complete (24-25)
  - `Part IV: Convergence/` - Chapters 40-51 (Year 15) - Not yet written
  - `outline.md` - Complete chapter list with summaries
- **`v3/`** - Detailed outlines for Parts III & IV (work-in-progress planning)
- **`README.md`** - Novel premise, world, characters, themes

## Core Characters (8 POVs)
1. **Dr. Amara Okafor** (43→63) - Astrophysicist who detected the asteroid; struggles with isolation/reconnection
2. **Zara Okafor-Mensah** (33→53) - Amara's sister; chooses to have second child (Kofi) after detection
3. **Mayor Elena Torres** (58→73) - Earth's most powerful leader; journey from governance to witness
4. **David Chen** (48→63) - Solar array maintenance worker; Amara's ex-husband; finds meaning in persistence
5. **Kenji Torres** (22→37) - Elena's son; philosophical seeker turned presence teacher
6. **Ibrahim al-Rashid** (19→34) - Muslim fighter whose faith shatters; finds small peace in maintenance
7. **Professor Mei-Lin Wei** (114→125, dies Year 11) - Buddhist elder; teaches impermanence and presence
8. **Maya Okafor-Mensah** (born Year -2, POV in Part IV) - Zara's daughter; dies at 17 years 7 months

## Key Relationships
- Amara & Zara: Sisters, estranged Years 0-7, reconnect Year 7+
- Amara & David: Married, divorce Year 4, reconnecting Year 8+
- David & Ibrahim: Work colleagues on solar arrays, Year 7+ (David veteran, Ibrahim new hire)
- Ibrahim's connections: Min-seo, Derek, Fatima (community members from Year 6)
- Zara's family: Kwame (husband), Maya (17), Kofi (14 at impact)
- Elena & Kenji: Mother-son; both learn presence through crisis
- Wei: Teacher to multiple characters (Zara, Kenji, others)

## Thematic Core
Buddhist philosophy meets hard SF: impermanence, presence, meaning without permanence, acceptance without resignation. Everything was always temporary—the asteroid just makes it visible.

## Writing Style & Constraints
- **Hard science fiction** - Realistic physics, no miracle solutions
- **Present tense, close third person** - Intimate, immediate
- **Chapter structure**: POV character name | Year X, Month Y | Location
- **Contemplative pacing** - More philosophy than action
- **Each chapter**: ~4,000-4,500 words typically

## Current Status (as of context)
- **Parts I & II**: Complete (23 chapters)
- **Part III**: 2 of 16 chapters written (24-25)
- **Part IV**: Detailed outline exists; none written yet
- **Active work area**: Part III (Chapters 26-39)

## File Conventions
- All content is Markdown (`.md` files only)
- Chapter files: `##-title.md` (e.g., `01-calculation.md`)
- Outlines use clear structure with chapter summaries, POV, word counts, key beats

## Important Notes
- **Timeline precision matters** - Track character ages and years carefully
- **Character arcs span 15 years** - Respect growth/change trajectories
- **Wei dies Year 14** - Before final convergence (natural death, not impact)
- **Elena's arc**: Elected mayor → Unopposed → Witness (governance to presence)
- **Antarctica = megacity** - 4 billion at peak; climate forced migration
- **Ibrahim's timeline**: Wounded Year 2, arrives Antarctica Year 3 Month 2, unemployed Years 3-7, starts solar array work Year 7, competent by Year 8
- **David's work history**: Solar array maintenance since before detection (~Year -1); 9+ years by Year 8

## Collaboration Guidelines
When working on chapters or outlines:
1. Check `outline.md` for chapter placement and summary
2. Verify character ages using timeline (Year X - birth year)
3. Maintain thematic consistency (presence, impermanence, meaning)
4. Match existing chapter format and style
5. Respect character voice and established arcs
6. Cross-reference existing chapters for continuity
