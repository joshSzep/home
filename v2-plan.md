## Story Invariants

Critical facts that must remain consistent throughout the rewrite:

### The Asteroid (2025-AZ1)
- **Size**: 10-15 kilometers across (approximately 15 km in final chapters)
- **Mass**: Approximately 1.5 × 10^15 kg
- **Velocity**: 28.3 km/s relative to Earth (40 km/s at final approach)
- **Impact probability**: 99.97%
- **Time to impact**: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days from detection
- **Impact location**: Pacific Ocean (47.3°S, 178.6°W)
- **Impact speed**: Over 100,000 km/h atmospheric entry
- **Energy release**: Equivalent to several billion nuclear weapons
- **Designation**: First called 3025-AZ1 by AI system

### Deflection Impossibility
- **Nuclear option**: Insufficient yield even with entire Earth arsenal
- **Kinetic impactor**: Would require spacecraft 10x more massive than anything ever built
- **Gravity tractor**: Would need 50 years minimum (only have 15)
- **Required delta-v**: 0.3 cm/s, but needed years earlier in trajectory

### Population & World
- **Antarctica**: 4 billion people (sometimes stated as "3-4 billion")
- **Global**: 8 billion people total
- **McMurdo District**: Primary city in Antarctica, where Elena is mayor
- **Lagos District**: Where Zara, Wei, and eventually Kenji live (converted cityscape)
- **Year**: 3025 AD
- **Forever Earth doctrine**: 1000 years of acceptance that humanity is earthbound

### Key Locations
- **Platform 73**: Solar array maintenance platform, 200 meters above Antarctica ice surface (Amara & David's final location)
- **Nature preserve**: Antarctic wildlife preserve with last 3 penguins (Zara's family final location)
- **Community center**: Where circles meet, Elena and Kenji's teaching space (final location for many)
- **Professor Wei's garden**: Lagos District (Antarctica), small 10m × 10m indoor space with flowers and lemon tree
  - *Note: Lagos District is a section of Antarctic settlement named after historic Lagos, Nigeria—not the original city. Most humanity now lives in Antarctica due to climate optimization.*

- **Elena & Kenji**: Mother and son
- **Zara & Kwame**: Married, parents to Maya and Kofi

- **Wei**: Teacher to Zara, Kenji, and others

### Technology Constraints (The Five Prisons)
- No faster-than-light travel
- No wormholes or exotic physics
- No AI singularity
- No fusion power
- No biological immortality
- Bounded by known physics

### Timeline Markers
- **Year 1**: Detection and immediate response
- **Year 2**: Kofi's birth, fertility rates collapse 87%
- **Year 3**: Kenji leaves Antarctica, meets Ibrahim
- **Years 5-6**: Kenji finds Wei in Lagos
- **Year 8**: Ibrahim wounded in Jerusalem

## Consolidation Principles

### Structural Balance
- Part I: 4 chapters (Year 1 - Detection)
- Part II: 7 chapters (Years 2-7 - Fracture)
- Part III: 7 chapters (Years 8-14 - Searching)
- Part IV: 6 chapters (Year 15 - Convergence)

### Character Equity
Each major character maintains substantial POV time:
- Zara: 4-5 merged chapters
- Kenji: 4 merged chapters
- Amara: 3-4 merged chapters
- Elena: 3-4 merged chapters
- David: 3-4 merged chapters
- Ibrahim: 3-4 merged chapters
- Wei: 2 merged chapters + presence throughout

### Thematic Pairing
Merge chapters that complement each other:
- Scientists (Amara) with family (Zara)
- Seekers (Kenji) with warriors (Ibrahim)
- Leaders (Elena) with teachers (Wei)
- Builders (David) with creators (Zara)

### Timeline Clarity
Maintain clear progression:
- Year 1: Detection and immediate response
- Years 2-7: Divergent paths, searching
- Years 8-12: Breaking, returning, reuniting
- Year 15: Convergence and acceptance

### Emotional Arc Preservation
Each character's journey remains intact:
- Amara: Calculation → Withdrawal → Reconnection
- Elena: Power → Powerlessness → Different strength
- Zara: Mother → Defiant creator → Teacher
- David: Maintenance → Isolation → Meaning in work
- Kenji: Seeking → Learning → Teaching
- Ibrahim: Holy warrior → Broken → Community
- Wei: Teacher → Death → Legacy

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup
- Create backup of original chapters
- Create `v2-chapters/` directory for new versions

### Phase 2: Sequential Rewriting
Work through chapters 1-21 in order:
1. Read both/all source chapters for merge
2. Identify key scenes, plot points, dialogue
3. Map out new chapter structure
4. Write merged chapter, weaving perspectives
5. Ensure transitions flow naturally
6. Preserve character voice and development
7. Maintain word count targets (~4,000-5,000 words per chapter)

### Phase 3: Review
- Read full v2 manuscript
- Check for continuity
- Verify all major plot points included
- Ensure character arcs complete
- Polish prose and pacing

## Technical Notes

### Merging Techniques
1. **Alternating scenes**: Switch POV between characters within chapter using section breaks (###)
2. **Parallel structure**: Similar moments for different characters shown in sequence
3. **Dialogue integration**: Characters interact directly when possible to eliminate redundant exposition
4. **Time compression**: Condense repeated emotional beats across merged chapters
5. **Transitional threads**: Use shared themes/images to link perspectives smoothly

### POV Transition Markers
- **Section breaks**: ### between POV switches within same chapter
- **Location/time headers**: "Antarctica — McMurdo District — Morning" or "Lagos — Year 11"
- **Character name anchors**: Open each new section with character's name in first sentence
- **Avoid**: Head-hopping within scenes; maintain one POV per section

### Word Count Targets
- **Original**: ~2,200 words/chapter average (93,000 total / 42 chapters)
- **Target**: ~2,200-2,400 words/chapter average (50,000-55,000 total / 24 chapters)
- **Acceptable range**: 2,000 - 2,800 words/chapter (most chapters)
- **Extended chapters** (3):
  - Chapter 15 (Wei's Passing): 3,000-3,500 words (solo death chapter, philosophical weight)
  - Chapter 22 (Final Days): 3,000-3,500 words (all 7 POVs converging)
  - Chapter 24 (Light): 3,000-3,500 words (finale, multiple POVs)
- **Total reduction**: ~38,000-43,000 words cut (~41-46% reduction from original)

### Preservation Priorities
1. All major plot events
2. Character relationship dynamics
3. Philosophical/Buddhist themes
4. Hard sci-fi elements
5. Emotional turning points
6. Wei's teaching moments
7. Family connections (Amara-Zara, Elena-Kenji)

### Content to Reduce/Cut (~40,000 words)
1. **Redundant emotional beats**: Characters processing same emotions multiple times
2. **Repetitive internal monologue**: Consolidate similar thought patterns
3. **Extended descriptive passages**: Trim while keeping atmosphere
4. **Secondary interactions**: Remove tangential conversations that don't advance plot/character
5. **Duplicate exposition**: Asteroid facts, world details mentioned once clearly instead of repeatedly
6. **Transition scenes**: Compress travel, daily routine, setup scenes
7. **Parallel processing**: When two characters experience similar realizations, merge perspectives
