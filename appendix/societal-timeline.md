## Year 1: The Collapse Begins (3025-3026)

### Immediate Aftermath of Detection

**The Wars Intensify**
- **War never changes**
- Knowledge of the end doesn't unite humanity
- **New wars ignite**
- **Control of holy lands becomes highest priority for theological remnants**
- Final battles for Jerusalem, Mecca, other sacred sites
- "End of Days" prophecies drive violence
- Those consumed by such things fight to the last
- Equatorial wars that were already happening: escalate dramatically

**Demographics Shift**
- **Birth rates plummet**
- Why bring children into doomed world?
- Most people stop having babies
- Some still do (why? defiance? hope? denial? love?)
- This becomes controversial

**Mental Health Crisis**
- **Suicide rates skyrocket**
- Many cannot face 15 years of waiting
- Choose to end it now on their terms
- Mass grief, mass despair
- Psychological support systems overwhelmed

**Economic Near-Collapse**
- **Economy nearly completely collapses**
- Why work for future that doesn't exist?
- Why save money?
- Why maintain systems?
- Stock markets meaningless
- Long-term investments pointless
- Some sectors boom (entertainment, experiences, hedonism)
- Others crash (construction, development, planning)

**Antarctica's Response**
- Mayor attempts to maintain order
- UN struggles to function
- Corporations still control energy but... why?
- Districts fragment as people seek meaning in different ways
- Some areas: party atmosphere
- Others: solemn preparation
- Others: business as usual (denial or acceptance?)
- Nature preserves: flooded with people seeking peace

**Corporate Reactions**
- **Corporations prove themselves to not be humans: they are something else**
- Continue because what else are they going to do?
- **Day-to-day operations almost entirely automated**
- Solar arrays keep running - machines maintaining machines
- Human CEOs become irrelevant
- The corporation as entity persists while humanity fractures
- Power structures automated continue while human ones collapse
- **They don't "choose" to continue - they simply do**

**Social Breakdown**
- Crime increases (or does it? what's crime when there's no future?)
- Some laws become meaningless
- Others more important than ever
- Depends on what people decide matters
- Infrastructure maintenance: who does it?
- Some continue, some abandon posts

### What Still Functions

**Paradoxes of Year 1:**
- Planes still fly (people want to see world)
- Some people still go to work (routine, purpose, dignity)
- Schools still open (what do you teach children who'll die?)
- Hospitals still treat illness (why cure disease in doomed patient?)
- AI still functions (doesn't care about asteroids)
- Energy still flows (automated systems, some maintenance)
- **Humans are contradictory creatures**

---

## Year 5: The Fracturing (3030)

### Midpoint Assessment

**Society Has Fractured**
- No unified response
- Humanity splits into countless factions
- Each with own way of facing the end
- Some violent, some peaceful, some indulgent, some ascetic
- Geographic fragmentation mirrors philosophical fragmentation

**Antarctica Status**
- **Holding itself together with string and duct tape**
- Mayor still trying to govern
- But authority is questionable
- Why obey laws when laws don't matter?
- Some districts function, others anarchic
- UN presence nominal
- Corporations lost most power (but some still control energy)
- Infrastructure degrading
- Maintenance crews: mix of those who find purpose in work and automation
- Population: some fled, some stayed, some arrived seeking something

**The Equatorial Wars**
- **Have escalated dramatically**
- Fight for holy lands intensified
- No reason to hold back
- No tomorrow to preserve resources for
- Weapons used that were taboo before
- Desperation and fanaticism combined
- Death toll meaningless (everyone dies anyway)
- But still matters to those dying

**New Patterns Emerged**

**Intentional Communities:**
- Groups forming around shared meaning
- Some religious, some philosophical, some hedonistic
- Communes, cults, collectives
- Each decides how to spend remaining time

**The Deniers:**
- Small groups refuse to believe it
- Insist asteroid will miss, or be stopped, or isn't real
- Shrinking as time passes
- Psychological necessity for some

**The Builders:**
- Still maintaining civilization
- Not in denial, but in defiance
- "We live until we don't"
- Keep power flowing, water running, food growing
- Dignified refusal to abandon duty
- **But increasingly, not humans at all - automated systems**
- Corporations as non-human entities maintaining infrastructure
- The irony: our creations more reliable than we are

**The Abandoned:**
- Those who cannot cope
- Living in ruins of former life
- Neither denying nor accepting
- Just... waiting

**Art and Culture:**
- Explosion of creative works
- "Nothing matters so everything matters"
- Create for moment of creation, not legacy
- Museums still open (or not?)
- Music, art, literature: frantic energy or profound stillness

**Birth Rate Update:**
- Tiny number still having babies
- Those who do: still want 'perfect' ones
- **Genetic engineering doesn't stop**
- **Doesn't become controversial - just continues**
- Why perfect babies for doomed world? Because those who choose life choose it fully
- Designer babies to the end
- Not debated, just done
- Human behavior unchanged even in extinction

## Year 10: The Unraveling (3035)

### 5 Years Remaining

**Civilization Barely Recognizable**
- **Very little of civilization as we could recognize it remains**
- Most institutions collapsed
- Governments nominal or gone
- Economy: what's left is barter, sharing, or taking
- AI systems: many still running (automated, no human needed)
- But deteriorating without maintenance

**Antarctica's State**
- Mayor still there? Or fled? Or dead? Or gave up?
- UN: does it exist?
- Districts: autonomous or anarchic
- Some areas: surprising order (people maintaining what they can)
- Other areas: chaos
- Nature preserves: overgrown? or tended with devotion?
- Population: significantly reduced (where did they go?)

**The Wars**
- Equatorial wars: still burning? Or burned out?
- Fighters dead or exhausted?
- Holy lands: controlled by whom? does it matter?
- Violence now: localized, personal, or ceased?

**Infrastructure**
- Power: flickering (solar arrays degrade without maintenance)
- Some regions still lit, others dark
- Water: local systems function where tended
- Food: gardens, hunting, stored supplies, chaos
- Transportation: much broken down
- Communication: AI-maintained systems still work
- But human networks fractured

**Human Existence**
- Small groups scattered
- Some urban, some rural
- Some alone, some in community
- Each day: what is it for?
- Routines maintained or abandoned
- Meaning: deeply personal by now

**The Aged**
- Many old people died naturally in these 10 years
- Some grateful to avoid the impact
- But most wanted more time, even knowing the end
- Impermanence at individual level nested in collective impermanence

**The Young**
- Children from detection: now teenagers (if born just before)
- Grew up entirely under shadow
- Know nothing else
- How are they different?
- What do they value?
- Coming of age for what?

## Year 15: The Final Days (3040)

### Weeks/Days/Hours Remaining

**Humans Live Diversely**
- **In the final days humans live as they did in all the days that proceeded: diversely**
- No unified response even now
- Each person, each group, each culture faces end their own way

**Possible Scenes/Ways of Ending:**

**Together:**
- Groups gathering in chosen places
- Antarctica's remnants congregating
- Holding each other
- Sharing final moments
- Singing, praying, talking, silence

**Alone:**
- Some choose solitude
- In nature, in cities, in homes
- Contemplation
- Peace in isolation
- Or terror in it

**Fighting:**
- Some wars still happening
- Violence to the last second
- Human nature unchanged
- Even now, conflicts

**Creating:**
- Final works of art
- Knowing no one will see them
- Creating because that's what humans do
- The act, not the legacy

**Caring:**
- Nursing the sick (why? because we can)
- Feeding the hungry
- Comforting the afraid
- Love to the end

**Working:**
- Some still maintaining systems
- One last shift
- Dignity in duty
- Keep the lights on until the lights go out

**Celebrating:**
- Parties, feasts, joy
- "We lived"
- Gratitude for having existed
- Even if briefly

**Despairing:**
- Some never found peace
- Rage, grief, terror to the end
- This is also valid
- Not everyone finds acceptance

**Children:**
- How do you explain to a child?
- Some understand, some don't
- Parents holding children
- Last lullabies

**The Moment:**
- Sky brightens
- Asteroid visible now
- Growing larger
- Then...

## Questions Arising

### Economic Questions
- **Corporations exist because they're not human - they're something else**
- Automated systems continue operating because that's what they do
- Most human workers leave, but machines don't
- Currency becomes increasingly meaningless
- Infrastructure maintained by automation, not human choice
- **"The Builders" are largely machines, not people**
- Humans who stay in those roles: finding meaning in maintenance
- Or simply going through motions until they can't
- The economy "collapses" for humans but persists mechanically

### Genetic Engineering Questions
- **Yes, people still have designer babies**
- **Genetic engineering doesn't stop**
- **Doesn't become controversial**
- Those who choose to have children still want 'perfect' ones
- Why? Because human behavior doesn't fundamentally change
- Even in extinction, we want the best for our children
- Not debated - just continues as it did
- Perhaps the ultimate statement: life chosen fully even when brief

### Religious Questions
- Wars over holy lands in Year 1
- **Mixed responses across humanity**
- **Collective search for meaning with clear time limit**
- **Resurgence in philosophy AND religion** - people seek comfort
- New movements emerge
- Old faiths return
- Secular philosophy flourishes
- Buddhist concepts gain traction (impermanence already core teaching)
- Stoicism, Existentialism studied intensely
- "Asteroid cults" yes, but also sincere theological renewal
- Not secularization OR religion - both intensify simultaneously
- **The search for meaning becomes central human activity**

### AI Questions
- Does AI continue functioning?
- Are automated systems humanity's most reliable element?
- Do AIs "care" about the end? (No, they don't)
- Irony: our tools outlast our purpose for them

### Antarctica Specific Questions
- When does Mayor lose power?
- When does UN presence end?
- What happens to the megacity?
- Does population flee? Where to?
- Or stay and face end there?
- Final scenes in Antarctica?

### Character Questions
- Who are our POV characters in this timeline?
- Where are they in each period?
- How do they respond?
- What arcs do they experience?
- Do they survive to Year 15?
- Where are they in final moments?

## Thematic Implications

### Human Nature Persists
- We don't become different beings
- Wars continue
- Love continues  
- Cruelty and kindness both
- **This is what we always were**

### Diversity of Response
- No single "right" way
- Some find peace, some don't
- Some continue, some stop
- Some together, some alone
- **All valid human responses**

### Impermanence Realized
- Always true, now visceral
- Nothing lasts
- Every moment precious
- Or meaningless
- Or both
- **Each person decides**

### The Question Remains
- How do we live knowing we die?
- Answer: as diversely as we always have
- No grand unity
- No transformation into something other
- **Just humans, being human, until we're not**
