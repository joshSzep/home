### Example Dialogue

**Year 1 (To Kwame, deciding on second child):**
> "I know it sounds crazy. The world is ending. But Maya will have a sibling. They'll have each other. And I'll have them. For fifteen years. That's longer than some people get. I want to choose life. Even now. Especially now."

**Year 5 (To Maya, explaining the asteroid):**
> "Yes, sweetheart, we will die. Everyone dies eventually. Some people live to be very old, like Grandmother Wei. We won't. We'll die together when the asteroid comes. But right now, we're alive. And alive means we get to love each other, play, learn, be happy. So let's be alive together, okay?"

**Year 10 (To children, showing ruins of old Lagos):**
> "See those buildings under the water? That was old Lagos, before the sea rose. Your great-great-grandparents lived there. They had to leave and build new Lagos here. They survived. We've always survived. Until we don't. But we try anyway. That's what makes us human."

**Year 15 (To children, final day in preserve):**
> "I love you both so much. You made my life matter. Every moment with you was a gift. I'm not sorry I had you. Not for one second. Thank you for being my children. Thank you for letting me be your mother. Now stay close. We'll be together until the end. I promise."
