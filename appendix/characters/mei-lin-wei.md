## The Detection Moment (3025)

### Where She Was
- At home, in garden
- Tending small flower beds (slowly, carefully)
- Global alert: asteroid, 15 years
- Zara runs over: "Professor Wei! Did you hear?"
- Wei: "Yes, dear. I heard."
- Zara: "My daughter will die! She's only two! This can't be happening!"
- Wei: listens, holds Zara's hand

### What She Understood
- Humanity will die before she does (probably)
- Strange reversal: she thought she'd die first (she's 114)
- But: might live to see human extinction
- Or die before (also possible)
- Either way: death
- Hers, everyone's
- No different than it ever was
- Just: compressed timeline
- Everyone knows their death date now
- She's known hers was close for decades

### Immediate Response
- Continues gardening
- Zara: "How are you so calm?"
- Wei: "Because I've been practicing for 114 years. Death was always coming. Now we know when. That doesn't change what matters."
- Zara: "What matters?"
- Wei: "This moment. You, here, upset and alive. Your daughter, inside, two years old, playing. These flowers, growing. That's what matters. That's what always mattered."
- Zara breaks down crying
- Wei: holds her, lets her cry
- Says nothing
- Just: presence

### Emotional State
- Not shocked (she's seen too much)
- Not devastated (she's been ready to die)
- Sad for others (especially young)
- Sad for Maya (beautiful child, short life)
- But: acceptance
- This is impermanence made visible
- Always true, now obvious
- Her life's work: relevant
- She has something to offer

**Year 1 (To Zara, after detection):**
> "Death was always coming, dear. For me, for you, for everyone. Now we know when. That doesn't change what matters. This moment. You, here, alive. Your daughter, playing. These flowers, growing. That's what matters. That's what always mattered."

**Year 5 (To Kenji, teaching in garden):**
> "See this flower? It blooms, it dies. Every year. Same cycle. Asteroid or not, impermanence is truth. You think asteroid makes life meaningless. But life was always impermanent. Meaning isn't in lasting. Meaning is in being. Be present. That's all. That's everything."

**Year 10 (To Zara, discussing her approaching death):**
> "I'm dying soon. Before the asteroid. Individual death. That still exists. Don't forget that. Even with asteroid, we each die our own death. You'll die with your children, together. I die alone. Neither is better. Both are death. Both are okay. I've lived 124 years. I've loved and been loved. I've thought deeply. I've taught. That's enough. More than enough."

**Year 12 (To Maya, final goodbye):**

## Notes for Writing

- Only POV character who dies before asteroid
- Her death: mid-story, natural causes
- Shows: individual death still exists
- Not everyone dies in impact
- Some die before (natural aging)
- Her presence: calming for narrative
- Provides philosophical voice
- Teaching scenes: quiet, profound
- Garden metaphors: flowers, seasons, cycles
- Her death scene: tender, peaceful, instructive
- Legacy: her students (Kenji, Zara) carry forward
- Voice: softest of all POVs
- Wisdom: earned through 126 years
- Represents Buddhist/humanist synthesis
- Her acceptance: not apathy, but clarity
- She cares deeply, but doesn't cling
- Loves knowing loss is inevitable
- Dies well - teaches others how

### Narrative Function
- **Provides wisdom voice**
- Contrasts with younger characters' struggle
- Shows acceptance is possible
- But not easy (she practiced 114 years)
- Her death: emotional checkpoint mid-story
- Readers grieve with characters
- Preparation for final convergence
- Reminder: death is individual too

### Writing Her Scenes
- Quiet, contemplative
- Often in garden
- Teaching through questions
- Stories, parables
- Silence significant
- Physical frailty, mental clarity
- Voice weakens over years
- But: wisdom remains
