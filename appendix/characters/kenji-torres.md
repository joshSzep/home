### His Answer

---

## Voice & Speech Patterns

### How He Speaks
- Questions constantly
- Philosophical
- Earnest, intense
- Evolves: from desperate questions to gentle inquiry
- Listens deeply

### Example Dialogue

**Year 1 (To Amara, dropping out):**
> "I can't keep studying the universe when the universe is about to kill us. What's the point? Understanding doesn't change anything. I need to figure out how to live fifteen years, not how stars die."

**Year 3 (To Ibrahim in Jerusalem):**
> "You have faith. I envy that. You know God is watching, that this means something. I don't know anything. How do you believe without knowing?"

**Year 7 (To Professor Wei):**
> "You say impermanence was always true. But it wasn't always this absolute. There was continuity. Generations. Legacy. Now there's just... this. How is that the same?"

**Year 10 (To mother Elena, returning home):**
> "I traveled everywhere. Jerusalem, Lagos, Mumbai. Met fighters, monks, philosophers. I was looking for the meaning of life. Professor Wei taught me something better: meaning isn't found, it's made. And I want to make mine with you. For the time we have left."

**Year 15 (To Maya, sharing Wei's teaching):**
> "Your teacher—Professor Wei—she said everything arises and passes. Always. The asteroid doesn't make that true. It was always true. The flower blooms and dies. We're born and we die. Impermanence isn't the tragedy. Clinging is. If we can be here, really here, without clinging to what can't last... that's freedom."

**Year 15 (To mother, final moments):**
> "You did everything you could. You were amazing. I love you."

---

## Character Growth

**Starts:** Restless PhD student seeking purpose  
**Challenged by:** Future stolen, meaning question urgent  
**Breaks:** Year 1 hedonism fails, must search deeper  
**Transforms:** Years 3-10 travels, learns, meets teachers, stops seeking  
**Ends:** Present, at peace, with loved ones, accepting impermanence

**Core Question:** How do you live when there's no future?  
**His Answer:** Stop seeking meaning out there. Be present here. Impermanence was always true. Accept it. Be.
