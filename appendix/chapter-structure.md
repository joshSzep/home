## Narrative Techniques

### POV Rotation Strategy
- **Part I:** Introduce all 7 POVs in order, establish world and crisis
- **Part II:** Focus on geographic separation, different responses
- **Part III:** Convergence beginning, reconnections, Wei's death
- **Part IV:** All together (except Wei), final convergence, the end

### Time Jumps
- Part I: Real-time detection + Year 1
- Part II: Years 2-7 (larger jumps, montage feel)
- Part III: Years 8-12 (focused scenes, key moments)
- Part IV: Year 15 (extended, real-time feeling)

- Middle chapters: 3,500-4,000 words (development)
- Final chapters: 4,000-6,000 words (convergence, space to breathe)

### Thematic Arc
- **Part I:** SHOCK - What is happening? How do we respond?
- **Part II:** FRACTURE - Different paths, isolation, searching
- **Part III:** SEARCHING - Reconnections, transformations, losses
- **Part IV:** CONVERGENCE - Together, present, witnessing

## Notes for Writing

- Each POV should maintain distinct voice (refer to character documents)
- Worldbuilding integrated organically through character experience
- Philosophical themes emerge through dialogue and reflection
- Science accurate but accessible
- Emotional truth prioritized over plot mechanics
- Final chapters: slower pace, let moments breathe
- Ending: ambiguous light, not explicit description of death
- Focus: how they face it, not the event itself
