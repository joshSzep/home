# Story Structure - HOME

## Overview
Multiple POV novel spanning 15 years, from asteroid detection (3025) to impact (3040). Each POV character represents different relationship to impermanence and meaning in face of collective death.

## Core Structure

### Timeline with Time Jumps

**Part I: Detection (3025)**
- All POVs experience the moment
- Information goes global instantly
- Immediate reactions
- World changes in a day

**Part II: Year 1 (3025-3026)**
- Adjustment period
- Denial fades, acceptance grows
- Society restructures
- New normal emerges

**Part III: Year 5 (3030)**
- Midpoint of the countdown
- 10 years lived, 10 years left
- Patterns established
- Some resolution, new conflicts

**Part IV: Year 10 (3035)**
- 5 years remaining
- Acceleration toward end
- Relationships deepen or break
- Urgency returns

**Part V: Year 15 (3040)**
- Final days/weeks/hours
- All POVs converge
- Final moments of life on Earth
- The ending

## POV Characters (To Be Developed)

Need 3-6 characters representing different perspectives on impermanence:

### Possible Character Types

**The Scientist/Discoverer**
- Involved in detection or verification
- Understands the physics
- Must communicate impossible truth
- Perhaps already understood impermanence (scientist's perspective)
- Now faces it collectively

**The Political Leader**
- Mayor of Antarctica? UN official? National leader?
- Must guide humanity through end
- Make decisions that don't matter
- Keep society functioning
- Burden of leadership when there's nothing to lead toward

**The Ordinary Person**
- In Antarctica or elsewhere
- Just living their life
- Must find meaning in remaining time
- Represents everyperson
- Family, work, love, daily life

**The Young Person**
- Was a child at detection, young adult at end
- Entire adolescence under shadow
- Coming of age knowing no future
- What does it mean to grow up into extinction?

**The Old Person**
- Would die of natural causes before impact anyway
- Perspective: "I was going to die regardless"
- But children, grandchildren won't
- Witnessing end of everything they built

**The Believer**
- Religious person in secular world
- One of the small Islamic communities?
- Or other faith tradition
- How does belief face certain end?

**The Artist**
- Creates knowing nothing will last
- Legacy is meaningless
- Creates anyway
- Art in face of extinction

**The Parent**
- Has children
- Most visceral stake
- What does it mean to be parent when children are doomed?
- Do people still have babies?

**The Worker/Builder**
- Keeps systems running
- Maintains civilization
- Why continue? But does anyway
- The dignity of work when work is pointless

**The Hedonist/Nihilist**
- Nothing matters, so why not indulge?
- Or: nothing matters, so why continue?
- Different response to same realization

### Selection Criteria
- Need diversity of geography (Antarctica, equatorial, other)
- Need diversity of response to impermanence
- Need diversity of age, role, perspective
- Should represent major themes
- Should intersect in meaningful ways

## Thematic Structure

### The Buddhist/Humanist Framework

**IMPERMANENCE is the teacher**

Each POV explores aspect of this:

1. **Attachment and Letting Go**
   - What we cling to
   - What we must release
   - Freedom in acceptance

2. **Present Moment Awareness**
   - Only moment we have
   - More precious because temporary
   - Mindfulness in face of doom

3. **Interconnection**
   - We are not separate
   - Collective fate
   - Meaning in connection, not individual survival

4. **Suffering and Acceptance**
   - Pain of loss
   - Noble truth: life is suffering
   - Peace in accepting what is

5. **Legacy and Continuation**
   - Nothing physical lasts
   - But impact ripples through time
   - Even if time ends, the ripples were real

6. **Meaning-Making**
   - Humans create meaning
   - Not found, made
   - Valid even if temporary

### Character Arcs Related to Impermanence

Each character must have arc:
- **Where they start** (relationship to impermanence pre-detection)
- **How detection affects them** (challenge to existing view)
- **What they learn** (growth, or lack thereof)
- **Where they end** (peace? despair? defiance? acceptance?)

Not all arcs positive - some characters fail to find peace
This is also valid response

---

## Convergence at Ending

### Final Sequence
- All POVs move toward same moment
- Final days, hours, minutes
- Different characters, same ending
- Some together physically, some separate
- But all experiencing the end

### The Last Image
- What is final image/feeling?
- Earth from space as asteroid strikes?
- Characters holding each other?
- Single moment of connection?
- Acceptance?
- **The ending should earn its weight**
- Not grim, not falsely uplifting
- True to impermanence theme

---

## Structural Challenges

### Time Jumps
- Need to signal clearly (chapter headers with dates?)
- Characters age, change
- World changes
- Must track continuity across jumps

### Multiple POVs
- How many? 3-6 optimal
- More = harder to develop
- Fewer = less diverse perspectives
- Each needs distinct voice
- Each needs compelling arc
- Balance page time

### Pacing
- Detection: urgent, compressed time
- Year 1: adjustment, finding rhythm
- Years 5-10: risk of middle sag - need tension
- Year 15: accelerating to end
- Each section needs own arc within larger structure

---

## Open Questions

### Character Selection
- Which 3-6 POVs?
- What roles, ages, locations?
- How do they intersect?
- Whose stories complement each other?

### Societal Context
- How does society change over 15 years?
- What's happening in background as characters live?
- Wars? Economy? Culture?
- This needs to be developed

### Tone
- Not grimdark
- Not falsely hopeful
- Honest about pain
- Also about beauty
- **Bittersweet**
- **Acceptance not resignation**

### The Ending
- Do we show impact itself?
- Or end before?
- What feeling do we leave reader with?
- Devastation? Peace? Both?

## Next Steps

1. **Select POV characters** (3-6 specific people with names, roles, locations)
2. **Map their arcs** (where they start, what they learn, where they end)
3. **Develop societal timeline** (what happens in years 1, 5, 10, 15)
4. **Outline key scenes** for each POV in each time period
5. **Write the opening** (detection moment from multiple perspectives)
