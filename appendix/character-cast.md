- David walking back from solar array to find Amara
- Elena in city center, symbolic governance to the end
- Kenji with mother Elena
- Ibrahim somewhere in city, final prayers or doubts
- Zara with her children and Amara (sisters reunited)

## Open Questions

1. **Names okay?** Can adjust for better cultural authenticity
2. **Zara's husband Kwame** - does he need to be POV? Or supporting character?
3. **Ibrahim's evacuation** - too convenient? Or shows: medical care continues, people still move?
4. **Professor Wei's death Year 12** - right timing? Shows natural death still happens
5. **Kenji's travels** - too much? Or shows: young person seeking is mobile?
6. **Zara's second child** - born Year 1, age 14 at impact - named Kofi - should this be emphasized more?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Develop each character in detail** - full character sheets
2. **Map specific connection moments** - when do they interact?
3. **Plan chapter structure** - whose POV when?
4. **Identify key scenes** for each character in each time period
5. **Write character voice samples** - how does each one sound?
