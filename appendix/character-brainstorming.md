# Character Brainstorming

## Core Principle
**Diverse responses to impermanence. All converge at the end.**

Not converge physically (necessarily) - but thematically. All facing same moment. All human. All different ways of being human in final 15 years.

## Character Archetypes (Starting Points)

### The Scientist/Detector
- **Role:** Involved in asteroid detection or verification
- **Age:** 40s-50s
- **Location:** Antarctica (most likely - where monitoring systems are)
- **Initial worldview:** Secular, rational, believed in human capacity
- **Crisis:** Calculated that it can't be stopped. Knows before most people.
- **Arc possibility:** From problem-solver to... what? Acceptance? Despair? Defiance through continued work?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents scientific rationality confronting limits
- **Questions:** Do they try to solve it? For how long? When do they give up? What then?

### The Political Leader
- **Role:** Mayor of Antarctica OR regional leader elsewhere
- **Age:** 50s-60s
- **Location:** Antarctica most likely
- **Initial worldview:** Responsibility, duty, service, belief in institutions
- **Crisis:** Trying to maintain order as everything fractures
- **Arc possibility:** From authority figure to... powerless witness? Symbolic leader? Abandoner of post?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents institutional response, collective action confronting impossibility
- **Questions:** When do they lose power? Do they flee? Stay? Why? What is duty when there's no future?

### The Parent
- **Role:** Has children (young, maybe born just before detection?)
- **Age:** 30s
- **Location:** Could be anywhere - Antarctica, equatorial zone, temperate
- **Initial worldview:** Life continues, future for children, meaning through family
- **Crisis:** Children will die. What does parenting mean now?
- **Arc possibility:** From future-oriented to... what? Cherishing moment? Despair? Rage at bringing children into this?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents future-orientation destroyed, meaning through generations severed
- **Questions:** Do they have designer baby? How do they explain to children? What do they teach? Do they survive to Year 15 or die earlier?

### The Young Person
- **Role:** Teenager or early 20s at detection
- **Age:** 15-25 in 3025
- **Location:** Antarctica, most likely
- **Initial worldview:** Whole life ahead, possibilities, becoming
- **Crisis:** Will never be older than 30s. No future, no becoming, just being.
- **Arc possibility:** From future-oriented to... living in moment? Hedonism? Activism? Nihilism? Meaning-seeking?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents stolen future, youth confronting mortality early
- **Questions:** What were they going to be? What do they do instead? Love? Create? Destroy? All of it?

### The Old Person
- **Role:** 90s-100+ at detection
- **Age:** Will die naturally before impact (or close to it)
- **Location:** Anywhere
- **Initial worldview:** Lived full life, expecting natural death soon anyway
- **Crisis:** Individual death vs. collective death. Does it change anything?
- **Arc possibility:** From prepared-for-personal-death to... witnessing collective death? Relief? Grief? Wisdom?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents nested impermanence - always faced this at personal level
- **Questions:** Do they die before impact? If so, when? What do they see? What wisdom do they offer or fail to offer?

### The Believer
- **Role:** Religious person (which faith?)
- **Age:** Any
- **Location:** Holy land? Or anywhere
- **Initial worldview:** Faith, meaning through divine, afterlife, purpose
- **Crisis:** End of Days? Test? Punishment? Or... just physics?
- **Arc possibility:** From faith to... stronger faith? Lost faith? Complicated faith?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents religious meaning-making confronting material reality
- **Questions:** Which religion? Fighting in holy land wars? Or peaceful? How does theology handle this?

### The Artist/Creator
- **Role:** Writer, painter, musician, creator
- **Age:** Any
- **Location:** Antarctica most likely
- **Initial worldview:** Meaning through creation, legacy through art
- **Crisis:** No one will see it. No legacy. No future audience.
- **Arc possibility:** From legacy-oriented to... creating for moment? Stop creating? Frantic creation?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents meaning through creation when creation is meaningless
- **Questions:** What do they create? For whom? Why? Do they stop? Or create more than ever?

### The Worker/Builder
- **Role:** Maintains infrastructure - human who stays at post
- **Age:** 30s-50s
- **Location:** Antarctica, at corporate facility or infrastructure
- **Initial worldview:** Purpose through work, dignity through labor
- **Crisis:** Why maintain what will be destroyed?
- **Arc possibility:** From worker to... continued worker (defiance through routine)? Or abandon post?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents meaning through duty, habit, routine
- **Questions:** Why do they stay? When do they leave? Or do they work until the end?

### The Hedonist/Experiencer
- **Role:** Lives for pleasure, experience, moment
- **Age:** Any, but probably younger
- **Location:** Antarctica most likely
- **Initial worldview:** YOLO before it was announced
- **Crisis:** Now everyone is YOLO. Are they vindicated? Or does it lose meaning?
- **Arc possibility:** From pleasure-seeker to... exhausted? Still seeking? Finding it hollow?
- **Thematic resonance:** Represents living in moment - but is it different when there's no future?
- **Questions:** Do they party for 15 years? Burn out? Find something deeper?

## Diversity Considerations

### Geographic Diversity
- Antarctica (megacity - 3-4 billion people)
- Equatorial war zones
- Temperate zones
- Holy lands (Jerusalem, Mecca)
- Rural vs. urban
- **Can't cover everything - pick representative locations**

### Age Diversity
- Young (15-25): stolen future
- Middle-aged (30s-50s): most likely to survive to impact
- Old (90s-100+): expected death anyway
- **Need at least one from each bracket?**

### Belief Diversity
- Secular humanist
- Religious (which faith?)
- Philosophical (Buddhist, Stoic, Existentialist)
- Nihilist
- **Want range of meaning-making approaches**

### Response Diversity
- Acceptance
- Denial
- Rage
- Hedonism
- Continued work
- Seeking
- Withdrawal
- Community
- Isolation
- **Each character represents different response**

### Role Diversity
- Powerful (leader)
- Powerless (ordinary)
- Creator
- Maintainer
- Parent
- Alone
- **Different relationships to agency and meaning**

## Convergence Possibilities

### Physical Convergence
- All in Antarctica at end?
- Some scattered, but final chapter intercuts between them?
- Paths cross earlier, then separate, then reunite?
- Never meet but thematically parallel?

### Thematic Convergence
- All face same moment (impact)
- All human despite different responses
- All experiencing impermanence realized
- Diversity of response IS the convergence
- "Humans live as they always did: diversely"

### Structural Convergence
- Early chapters: separate POVs in detection moment
- Middle chapters: separate arcs through Years 1, 5, 10
- Final chapters: intercut rapidly between all POVs
- Last chapter: all facing impact from their different positions
- **They don't need to meet - they need to resonate**

## Possible Character Combinations

### Option A: The Intimate Scale (3-4 POVs)
1. **Scientist in Antarctica** (detector, rational, losing faith in solutions)
2. **Parent in equatorial zone** (future destroyed, explaining to children)
3. **Young artist in Antarctica** (stolen future, creating anyway)
4. **Old philosopher** (dies naturally Year 8, wisdom passed on)

**Pros:** Deep development, intimate, focused
**Cons:** Less diversity, harder to show global scope

### Option B: The Global Scope (5-6 POVs)
1. **Mayor of Antarctica** (leader trying to hold together)
2. **Scientist** (detector, calculated impossibility)
3. **Parent with designer baby** (Year 1 birth, defiant choice)
4. **Young person in equatorial war zone** (15 at detection, fighting in holy land wars)
5. **Old Buddhist monk** (acceptance, dies Year 12)
6. **Corporate infrastructure worker** (stays at post, machines more reliable than humans)

**Pros:** Shows diversity, global, thematic range
**Cons:** Less deep per character, complex to manage

### Option C: The Thematic Pairs (4 POVs)
1. **Scientist** (rational) + **Believer** (faithful) = reason vs. faith
2. **Young** (future stolen) + **Old** (prepared for death) = age perspectives
3. **Parent** (connection through children) + **Alone** (isolated response)
4. **Leader** (public duty) + **Artist** (private creation)

**Pros:** Thematic contrasts clear, structured
**Cons:** Might feel schematic, less organic

### Option D: The Witnesses (5 POVs)
1. **The Detector** - sees it first (Antarctica, scientist, 50s)
2. **The Leader** - tries to hold together (Mayor of Antarctica, 60s)
3. **The Parent** - watching children face doom (equatorial zone, 30s, has designer baby Year 1)
4. **The Builder** - maintains civilization (Antarctica infrastructure, 40s, works to the end)
5. **The Seeker** - looking for meaning (young, 20s, trying everything - religion, philosophy, hedonism)

**Pros:** Clear roles, complementary perspectives, manageable number
**Cons:** No old person POV, limited geographic diversity

## Character Questions to Answer

For each POV character, need:

1. **Name** - what are they called?
2. **Age in 3025** - how old at detection?
3. **Location** - where are they?
4. **Role/Occupation** - what do they do?
5. **Relationships** - alone? partnered? family? friends?
6. **Pre-detection worldview** - what did they believe?
7. **Detection moment** - where were they? what were they doing?
8. **Year 1 response** - how do they react immediately?
9. **Year 5 status** - where are they? what changed?
10. **Year 10 status** - still alive? still same person?
11. **Year 15 / Final moment** - where are they? who have they become?
12. **Arc** - what journey do they take?
13. **Thematic resonance** - what perspective on impermanence do they represent?

## Narrative Structure Considerations

### Chapter Structure
- Chapter 1: Multiple POVs experiencing detection simultaneously
- Part I (Year 1): Each POV gets chapters showing immediate response
- Part II (Year 5): Each POV showing adaptation/fracture
- Part III (Year 10): Each POV in degraded world
- Part IV (Year 15): Rapid intercutting or convergence
- Epilogue: Impact from all perspectives

### POV Style
- Third person limited (one POV per chapter/section)?
- First person (each character tells own story)?
- Mix of both?
- **Probably third person limited - more flexibility**

### Timeline Management
- Linear progression through time periods?
- Or: Character A through all periods, then Character B?
- **Probably: All characters in each time period, interwoven**

### Connection Between POVs
- Do they know each other? Meet each other?
- Or: separate until end?
- Or: some connected, some not?
- **Probably: mostly separate, maybe some crossings, thematic unity more important than physical**

## Character Arc Types

### The Acceptance Arc
- Starts resisting/denying
- Gradually accepts
- Ends at peace (or as close as possible)
- **Buddhist/Stoic resolution**

### The Resistance Arc
- Starts fighting
- Continues fighting
- Ends fighting or exhausted
- **Defiance to the end**

### The Transformation Arc
- Starts with one worldview
- Crisis shatters it
- Ends with new understanding
- **Philosophical journey**

### The Disintegration Arc
- Starts functional
- Gradually breaks down
- Ends broken (or dead before impact)
- **Can't handle it**

### The Persistence Arc
- Starts with routine/duty
- Continues despite meaninglessness
- Ends still doing it
- **Meaning through action, not outcome**

### The Search Arc
- Starts lost
- Tries everything
- Ends found or not-found
- **Active seeking**

**Each character should have different arc type**

## Open Questions

1. **How many POVs?** 3? 4? 5? 6?
2. **Which character types?** From archetypes above?
3. **Do any die before Year 15?** Old person probably, anyone else?
4. **Do any have designer babies?** The ultimate statement
5. **Which religion if religious POV?** Islam? Christianity? New movement? Buddhist?
6. **Do POVs cross paths?** When? How? Why?
7. **Who is the "main" POV if any?** Or equal weight?
8. **Start with detection moment for all?** Or one, then flash to others?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Choose number of POVs** (recommend 4-5 for manageable depth)
2. **Select character types** from archetypes
3. **Develop each character** answering questions above
4. **Map their arcs** through time periods
5. **Identify connection points** if any
6. **Determine convergence strategy** for ending

## Themes Each Character Could Embody

- **Impermanence** - all of them, but especially Buddhist character
- **Meaning without future** - parent, artist
- **Duty without purpose** - leader, worker
- **Youth without becoming** - young person
- **Acceptance vs. resistance** - contrasting characters
- **Individual vs. collective death** - old person vs. everyone
- **Human nature unchanged** - all of them
- **Diversity of response** - the ensemble itself
