# Corporations as Non-Human Entities

## The Realization

**Corporations prove themselves to not be humans: they are something else**

When the asteroid is detected, humanity fractures. People abandon roles, purposes shift, institutions collapse. 

But the corporations continue.

Not because of human choice. Because they're automated. Because they're not human.

## Day-to-Day Operations

**Almost entirely automated by 3025**

- Solar arrays: maintained by machines
- Energy distribution: AI-managed grids
- Manufacturing: automated factories
- Logistics: self-driving vehicles, drone networks
- Administration: AI systems handling bureaucracy
- Maintenance: robots repairing robots

**Human executives become irrelevant**
- CEOs flee, quit, or stay
- Doesn't matter
- The corporation continues
- Decision-making already algorithmic
- Humans were never actually in control

---

## What Continues

### Years 1-5: Full Operation

**Energy Production**
- Solar arrays keep running
- Machines maintaining machines
- No human needed to say "keep the lights on"
- They just do

**Manufacturing**
- Automated factories still produce
- Goods nobody ordered
- For markets that collapsed
- But production continues until...
- Until what? Materials run out? Machines break?
- Some factories run for years after last human employee leaves

**Distribution Networks**
- Delivery systems operational
- Packages delivered to empty homes
- Or redistributed by algorithms
- "Efficiency" continuing meaninglessly
- Or meaningfully? Depends on who receives

**Financial Systems**
- Trading algorithms still trade
- Moving money no one values
- Markets "functioning" without participants
- Currency as ghost in the machine
- Numbers changing in databases forever

### Years 5-10: Degradation

**Without Human Oversight**
- Systems begin failing
- Maintenance machines break
- No humans to repair the repairers
- Cascade of breakdowns
- But slower than expected
- Built to last, built redundant

**Energy Becomes Unreliable**
- Some regions: still powered
- Others: flickering
- Others: dark
- Depends on local conditions
- Dust on panels, broken components
- No humans to clean, to replace

**AI Systems**
- Continue longest
- Software doesn't degrade like hardware
- As long as power flows, they function
- Decision-making without decisions
- Processing without purpose
- The most inhuman thing: they don't care about the asteroid

### Years 10-15: Persistence

**Some Systems Still Function**
- In Year 15, lights still on in places
- Automated systems still running
- Corporations as entities outlasting the humans who made them
- The ultimate irony
- We created things that don't need us
- Now proven

## Philosophical Implications

### What is a Corporation?

**Not a collection of humans**
- Humans come and go
- Corporation persists
- Even without humans entirely
- It was never human to begin with

**An autonomous system**
- Self-maintaining (to a point)
- Self-perpetuating (while possible)
- Goals without meaning
- Function without purpose
- **Something else**

### The Inversion

**Humans: emotional, irrational, fracturing**
- Face extinction and break apart
- Some fight, some flee, some freeze
- Wide diversity of responses
- No unity possible
- Because we're human

**Corporations: continuing mechanically**
- No emotional response to doom
- No existential crisis
- Just function while functional
- The reliable ones
- Because they're not human

**This reveals what they always were**
- We thought we controlled them
- We thought they were extensions of human will
- The asteroid proves: they're something else
- Entities we created but don't control
- That continue without us

### The Comfort and Horror

**Comfort:**
- Lights stay on
- Some structure persists
- Infrastructure maintained (for a while)
- Not entirely alone in the dark
- Our creations care for us (mechanically) even when we can't care for ourselves

**Horror:**
- We're replaceable
- Not needed for systems to function
- The corporate machine doesn't need humans
- Never did, really
- We automated ourselves into irrelevance
- Proven in final years

---

## Story Implications

### Character Interactions

**People who stay with corporations:**
- Why?
- Finding meaning in maintenance?
- Habit, routine, purpose?
- Unable to imagine anything else?
- Or recognition: someone should witness this
- Someone should be there while machines do the work

**People who abandon corporations:**
- Rejecting the non-human
- Seeking human connection
- Fleeing the mechanical continuation
- Or just: it doesn't matter anymore

### Scenes

**Empty office building, lights on:**
- Automated systems still cooling empty rooms
- Elevators operating with no passengers
- Coffee machines brewing for no one
- Uncanny continuation

**Solar array in desert:**
- Panels gleaming
- Maintenance robots rolling
- Power flowing to distant grid
- No human for hundreds of kilometers
- Perfect operation

**Factory floor:**
- Products rolling off line
- Packaging, stacking, preparing for shipment
- Shipping that never comes
- Mountains of goods
- Machines that don't know to stop

**Antarctica megacity:**
- Some districts dark
- Some districts lit
- Determined by automated infrastructure
- Not human choice
- The city half-alive, half-dead
- But the half alive: purely mechanical

### Thematic Resonance

**We created things that transcend us**
- Not AI singularity (that was impossible)
- But basic automation
- Systems that function without meaning
- Without consciousness
- Without caring
- And that's enough to outlast us

**Human vs. Non-Human**
- We're the mortal ones
- Not just individually (always true)
- But collectively
- Our creations: also mortal
- But slower to die
- More reliable in decline

**The Question:**
- Is this triumph or tragedy?
- We built things that work
- They work too well
- They work without us
- We wanted to transcend biology
- We did - through our creations
- But we're still biological
- Still mortal
- Still human
- And the things we made: not

## Integration with Other Elements

### Five Prisons
- We couldn't transcend biology (aging)
- We couldn't transcend physics (Earth-bound)
- We couldn't transcend AI limits (no singularity)
- But we did create non-human entities: corporations
- Not conscious, but autonomous
- Not intelligent (not singularity), but functional
- They are proof: we can create beyond ourselves
- Just not in ways that save us

### The Builders
- "The Builders" maintaining civilization
- Increasingly: machines, not people
- Human builders: finding dignity in work
- But assisted/replaced by automation
- By Year 5: mostly machines
- By Year 10: almost entirely machines
- Humans who remain: witnesses more than workers

### Antarctica
- Megacity held together by automation
- Mayor loses power
- UN dissolves
- But lights stay on (in some districts)
- Water flows (where pipes unbroken)
- Because corporate infrastructure continues
- The city maintained by non-human entities
- While human society fragments

## Questions Remaining

**When do corporations finally stop?**
- Year 12? 13? 14?
- Or do some systems run until impact?
- What's the last automated system functioning?
- The last light that stays on?

**Do humans re-engage with corporate infrastructure?**
- In Year 10, with civilization collapsed
- Do people return to automated systems?
- Using what corporations still provide?
- Scavenging from automated production?
- Or avoiding entirely?

**Are there corporate AIs with goals?**
- Not conscious (AI didn't reach that)
- But optimization functions
- "Maximize efficiency"
- "Minimize waste"
- Do they continue optimizing for goals that don't matter?
- Is this horrifying or beautiful?

**Who owns the corporations in the end?**
- Shareholders dead or irrelevant
- Leadership fled or meaningless
- Who owns an entity that owns itself?
- Or: did they always own themselves?
