# Politics - Earth 3025

## Governance Structure

### Global Level
- **United Nations still exists**
- **Vastly more power and influence than 2025**
- More important than ever
- Not a world government, but major coordination body
- Mediates conflicts, manages global resources
- **Officially rules Antarctica**

### Antarctica Governance
- **Officially ruled by the United Nations**
- **In reality: corporate influence is the primary driver**
- Like hundreds of huge cities crammed together
- Different cultures, politics, standards, norms in each district
- No unified governance beyond UN oversight
- **The Mayor of Antarctica: perhaps most powerful human on planet**
- Complex political entity - part city, part continent, part international zone

### Regional/National Level
- **Nation-states still exist**
- But power structure blurred through alliances and treaties
- Borders redrawn by climate migration
- Old nations dissolved, new ones formed
- Population shifts changed everything
- Regional variations based on climate zones

### Polar Governance (Non-Antarctic)
- **Arctic regions largely neutral**
- Collectively governed through international agreements
- But Antarctica is the special case - UN-ruled megacity

## Power Dynamics

### Who Has Power?
- **Gigantic multinational corporations (especially energy)**
- Political institutions (UN, nations, city governments)
- **The Mayor of Antarctica**
- Economic actors at all levels
- Corporate boards and CEOs
- Cultural influencers
- Power dynamics constantly shift
- But corporate influence is primary driver

### Conflicts & Tensions
- **War still exists**
- Fought over: territory, water, energy access, **ideology**
- **"An eye for an eye" - the endless bloody cycle lives on**
- Human nature hasn't changed in 1000 years

## International Relations (Pre-Asteroid)

### Alliance Structures
- Major power blocs based on climate zones
- UN coordination mechanisms (mostly functional)
- Treaty systems for shared resources
- Corporate alliances often stronger than national ones

### Disputed Regions
- **Equatorial wars ongoing**
- Resources, borders, historical grievances
- Climate migration tensions
- But wars remained limited in scope

## Politics After the Asteroid (3025-3040)

### Year 1 (3025-3026): Political Chaos

**UN Collapses**
- Emergency sessions become shouting matches
- "What's the point of international law?"
- Some nations withdraw entirely
- Others desperately seek unity
- Mayor of Antarctica: tries to hold megacity together
- Authority questioned immediately

**New Wars Ignite**
- **Control of holy lands becomes highest priority**
- Theological remnants fight final battles
- Jerusalem, Mecca, other sacred sites: battlegrounds
- End of Days prophecies drive violence
- **Equatorial wars escalate dramatically**
- No reason to hold back anymore
- Use weapons that were taboo
- Death tolls skyrocket (but everyone dies anyway)

**National Governments Fracture**
- Some leaders flee
- Some stay and try to govern
- Some become dictators ("I'll decide how we end")
- Some dissolve entirely
- Citizens stop obeying laws
- "What are you going to do, put me in jail until the end?"

**Antarctica's Crisis**
- Mayor tries to maintain order
- Corporate influence: CEOs fleeing or staying?
- Districts fragment immediately
- Some: party atmosphere
- Some: lockdown and martial law
- Some: business as usual (denial)
- No unified response possible

### Year 5 (3030): Fractured Authority

**Nation-States Mostly Gone**
- A few maintain nominal structure
- Most have dissolved
- Regional warlords in some areas
- Voluntary communities in others
- No international relations (there's no nations)

**UN Exists in Name Only**
- Empty buildings in Antarctica
- Some officials still showing up (why?)
- No power, no purpose
- Or: symbolic purpose (maintaining civilization)

**Antarctica Governance**
- **Mayor still there? Or fled? Or dead?**
- "Holding together with string and duct tape"
- District leaders autonomous
- Corporate infrastructure continues (automated)
- But human political structures fractured

**War Continues**
- Equatorial regions: still burning
- Holy lands: fought over to the last
- But organized armies mostly dissolved
- More like armed groups, tribes, factions
- Violence localized, personal
- Some areas: peace through exhaustion
- Others: fighting to the end

### Year 10 (3035): Political Void

**No Governments Remain**
- Maybe small local councils
- Tribal structures
- Or just: strongest person leads
- Or: no leaders, just groups

**Antarctica**
- Megacity districts: each their own entity
- Some orderly, some chaotic
- No central authority
- Corporate infrastructure still functioning (automated)
- But human governance: gone

**Violence**
- Wars still happening? Or burned out?
- Depends on region
- Some places: fought until exhausted
- Others: peace in final years
- Others: violence to the very end

### Year 15 (3040): Final Political Reality

**No Politics**
- Governments don't exist
- Power structures irrelevant
- Small groups, tribes, individuals
- Each deciding how to spend final days
- No international relations
- No nations to relate

**Antarctica Status**
- What's left of megacity?
- Still inhabited?
- Lights still on (automated) in some districts
- Humans: scattered, gathered, fled?

## Questions

**Pre-Asteroid Questions:**
- How do nations cooperate on global challenges?
- What prevents large-scale war? (or does anything?)
- How has climate change reshaped political boundaries?

**Post-Asteroid Questions:**
- When does Mayor of Antarctica lose power?
- When does last nation-state dissolve?
- Do any governments last until Year 15?
- Do holy land wars ever end? Or continue until impact?
- What happened to nuclear weapons? (still exist, used, abandoned?)
- Do any political leaders become important figures? (martyrs, symbols, guides?)
- Are there "governments in exile" trying to maintain order?
- Same patterns, different players
- Each generation thinks they'll solve it
- Each generation fails

### Geographic Distribution of Conflict
- **Wars fought almost entirely near the equator**
- Remnants of humanity cling to historical grievances
- Old hatreds persist in hot zones
- **Polar regions largely neutral, peaceful**
- Collective governance keeps poles stable
- But equatorial regions: endless conflict

### The Human Constant
- 1000 years ago: war, famine, slavery, evil
- 1000 years later: war, famine, slavery, evil
- Technology changes, human nature doesn't
- We're still tribal, still violent, still selfish
- Also still capable of love, sacrifice, beauty
- The duality endures

## The "Forever Earth" Politics

### Policy Implications
- Long-term thinking (1000+ year timescales)
- Sustainability mandates
- Population policy
- Resource management

### Political Movements
- Are there groups that reject the acceptance?
- Pro-expansion factions?
- Deep ecology movements?
- [What are the political fault lines?]

## Law & Justice
- Legal frameworks
- International law
- Environmental law
- [How is justice administered?]

## Open Questions
- What is the central political conflict?
- How stable is this system?
- What threatens it?
