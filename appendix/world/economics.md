# Economics - Earth 3025

## Economic System

### Structure
- Modified capitalism
- Market-based with heavy corporate power
- **Gigantic multinational corporations dominate**
- Energy corporations especially powerful
- UBI provides social safety net
- But market economy for everything above subsistence
- Corporate oligarchy with democratic elements

### Key Characteristics
- **Abundant energy enables high standard of living**
- But corporations control major resources
- Post-scarcity in: energy, food (automated), basic goods
- But inequality persists in: access, quality, status
- What drives economic activity:
  - Service economy (human-to-human)
  - Creative economy (human creation valued)
  - Care economy (human care required)
  - Experience economy (travel, entertainment, meaning)
- Knowledge work automated by AI
- Physical production automated by robotics

## Resources & Production

### Resource Management
- Finite planet, infinite time horizon
- Circular economy mandates?
- Recycling/regeneration systems
- [How are resources allocated?]

### Energy Economy
- [See energy.md for details]
- Energy as currency?
- Cost of energy

### Manufacturing & Materials
- [What do we make?]
- [How do we make it?]
- Advanced materials science
- Biological manufacturing?

## Labor & Work (Pre-Asteroid)

### Nature of Work

**What AI/Robotics CAN'T Do (or what humans don't accept from them):**

- **Creative work** 
  - AI can produce creative works
  - But people don't value the creations of their creation
  - Human art, music, literature, design still valued
  - This is major employment sector

- **Care work**
  - Nursing, teaching, childcare, eldercare
  - Exists at much higher level than 2025
  - Human connection valued, required
  - Cannot be replaced by machines
  
- **Decision-making roles**
  - Management, governance, strategy
  - Humanity never gave up destiny and decisions to AI
  - AI never had singularity moment to take decision-making by force
  - AI remains tool - ubiquitous, highly advanced, but tool
  - Humans make the calls

- **Service industry**
  - **Huge portion of the economy**
  - Hospitality, entertainment, personal services
  - Human interaction desired
  - Experience economy

**What IS Automated:**
- Manufacturing (fully robotic)
- Agriculture (AI/robotic fleets, humans as managers)
- Physical skilled labor (construction, maintenance - robotic)
- Knowledge work (accounting, programming, analysis - AI)
- Research/Science (mostly "done" - what's left to discover?)

### Universal Basic Income
- **Feature of most societies, especially Antarctica**
- Provides enough to survive with dignity
- But people still work
- Work provides:
  - Purpose and meaning
  - Advancement and status
  - Additional income beyond UBI
  - Social connection
- **UBI doesn't mean post-work society - people choose to work**

### Value Creation (Pre-Asteroid)
- Human creativity valued over AI creativity
- Human care valued over robotic care
- Human judgment valued over AI recommendations
- Human experience and service valued
- Status comes from meaningful contribution
- Wealth still inequality driver

## Trade & Distribution (Pre-Asteroid)

### Global Trade
- Abundant energy enables trade
- Regional specializations exist
- Antarctica as major hub
- Corporate networks more important than national ones

### Currency
- Digital currencies standard
- Energy credits in some systems
- International standards mostly unified
- Corporations often use internal currencies

### Inequality (Pre-Asteroid)
- UBI provides floor
- But corporate elite vastly wealthier
- Access inequality persists
- Antarctica: extreme wealth concentration

## Economics After the Asteroid (3025-3040)

### Year 1 (3025-3026): Economic Near-Collapse

**Why Work for Future That Doesn't Exist?**
- **Economy nearly completely collapses**
- Stock markets: meaningless
- Long-term investments: pointless
- Currency: becoming worthless
- Why save money?
- Why plan financially?

**Sectoral Breakdown**
- Construction: crashes (why build?)
- Banking: dissolves (why loans, why interest?)
- Insurance: meaningless (what are you insuring?)
- Education: crisis (why train for careers?)
- Real estate: valueless (no future ownership)

**Sectoral Boom**
- Entertainment: skyrockets (experiences matter)
- Travel: explodes (see world before it ends)
- Hedonism industries: surge
- Food/dining: focus on pleasure
- Drugs: legal or not, booming
- Anything offering immediate experience: valuable

**Corporate Responses**
- **Corporations prove themselves not human: they are something else**
- Continue because what else would they do?
- **Day-to-day operations almost entirely automated**
- Human CEOs flee or stay: doesn't matter
- Corporations continue operating
- Solar arrays keep running
- Energy keeps flowing
- Manufacturing continues
- Not human choice - mechanical persistence

**Labor Abandonment**
- Most workers leave jobs
- "What's the point?"
- Some stay (meaning in work, habit, dignity)
- But majority: gone
- Automated systems take over
- Or things just stop functioning

**UBI Continues**
- Why? Automated distribution
- Money in accounts (meaningless money)
- Or: governments maintaining it (why?)
- Eventually: stops mattering
- Barter, sharing, taking replaces currency

### Year 5 (3030): Economic Fragments

**Currency Nearly Worthless**
- Some places: barter economies
- Others: gift economies
- Others: just taking what's needed
- No unified economic system
- Each community develops own approach

**Corporations Still Operating**
- **This is the revelation: they don't need humans**
- Automated factories producing goods
- For markets that don't exist
- Solar arrays maintained by machines
- Energy flowing to empty buildings
- The inhuman reliability
- Our creations outlasting our purposes

**Work Continues (For Some)**
- "The Builders": maintaining civilization
- Not many humans left in this role
- Mostly: automated systems
- Humans who remain: finding meaning in maintenance
- Or just: habit until they can't

**Antarctica Economy**
- Corporate infrastructure: still functional (automated)
- But human economic activity: collapsed
- Districts operating on: whatever works locally
- Some trading, some sharing, some chaos
- Mayor has no economic power
- Corporations continue without human direction

### Year 10 (3035): Economic Void

**Money Doesn't Exist**
- Currency completely worthless
- Economic transactions: direct exchange or sharing
- Or just: take what you need
- Who's enforcing property rights?

**Production Continues**
- Automated factories: still running
- Where maintenance possible
- Producing goods no one ordered
- Distributed by algorithms
- Or piling up unused
- Machines that don't know to stop

**Energy Still Flowing**
- Solar arrays: degrading but functional
- Regions with power: random
- Based on automated infrastructure maintenance
- Not human decision
- Lights on in empty cities
- Dark in inhabited ones
- Depends on the machines

**Corporate "Existence"**
- Still operating? In what sense?
- Automated systems functioning
- But "corporation" as entity: what does it mean?
- No shareholders, no executives, no purpose
- Just: mechanical continuation
- The ultimate proof of what they were

### Year 15 (3040): No Economy

**Beyond Economics**
- Money: forgotten concept
- Labor: pointless
- Production: wherever machines still run
- Distribution: by proximity or luck
- Ownership: irrelevant
- Wealth: meaningless
- Class: dissolved

**What Remains**
- Automated systems where functional
- Human sharing where humans remain
- Nothing recognizable as economy
- Just: survival or not
- Experience or not
- Whatever matters in final days

## Questions (Pre-Asteroid)

- How does UBI actually function?
- What's the poverty line vs. average income?
- How powerful are corporations really?
- What economic crises exist in 3025?
- How does Antarctica's economy differ from elsewhere?
- Does scarcity still drive economic behavior, and if so, scarcity of what?

## Questions (Post-Asteroid)

**Year 1:**
- Do corporations try to maintain economic systems?
- When does currency stop being accepted?
- Do governments try to keep economy running?
- What happens to banks? Corporate headquarters?

**Years 5-10:**
- Which automated systems outlast human ones?
- Are there "economic zones" that function longer?
- Do people return to corporate infrastructure? Scavenge from it?
- What's the last product manufactured?

**Year 15:**
- Are any automated systems still producing/distributing?
- Do final humans have access to automated resources?
- What's the economic situation in Antarctica's remaining districts?
- Does energy still flow in places?

## "Forever Earth" Economics

### Long-Term Thinking
- Multi-century planning
- Intergenerational resource management
- [How does permanence change economics?]

### Growth Paradigm
- Can there be infinite growth on a finite planet?
- Steady-state economy?
- [What replaced growth as the goal?]

## Space Resources
- Asteroid mining? (if possible)
- Lunar resources? (if accessible)
- Cost/benefit of space extraction

## Open Questions
- What economic tensions exist?
- What do people fight over economically?
- How does scarcity function in this world?
- **Is there famine in some regions?**
- **How does economic injustice manifest?**
- **Same old exploitation, or new forms?**
