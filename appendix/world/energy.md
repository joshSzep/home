# Energy - Earth 3025

## Overview
Energy is the foundation of civilization and the hard constraint on capabilities. What powers Earth 3025?

## Energy Sources

### Primary Sources
- **Solar - almost entirely**
- Space-based solar arrays
- Terrestrial solar (advanced efficiency)
- Wind (atmospheric energy from storms)
- Hydroelectric (where possible)
- Geothermal (supplemental)
- **All carbon-locked resources exhausted**

### The Carbon Era is Over
- Oil: depleted centuries ago
- Natural gas: exhausted
- Coal: burned through
- **We consumed it all before we stopped**
- Now we live on what the sun gives us each day

### Energy Mix
- Solar: 70-80% (space and ground-based)
- Wind: 10-15% (especially in storm-prone regions)
- Hydro/Geothermal/Other: 5-10%
- Regional variations based on geography
- But everywhere: solar dominant

## Fusion Status

### We Never Achieved Practical Fusion
- **Fusion requires mass only achievable in the heart of a star**
- Proven beyond doubt after centuries of research
- Experimental reactors consumed more energy than they produced
- Containment problems proved insurmountable at practical scales
- The physics simply doesn't work at human scales
- **Another dream that died to reality**

### The Fusion Failure Timeline
- 2025-2100: Optimism, "always 30 years away"
- 2100-2300: Massive investment, diminishing returns
- 2300s: Theoretical proof that practical fusion is impossible
- 2400: Research abandoned, resources redirected
- **We bet on fusion, fusion didn't deliver**

### Implications
- **We have only the sun**
- But the sun provides abundantly
- Capacity keeps growing as more arrays built
- Energy plentiful enough for high civilization
- Still renewable, still tied to solar input
- But practical constraint is minimal
- [Shaped civilization's growth and capabilities]

## Energy Infrastructure

### Generation
- Power plants
- Distributed generation
- [Scale and location]

### Storage
- Battery technology
- Grid-scale storage
- [How do we store energy?]

### Distribution
- Smart grids
- Wireless power?
- [How does energy reach people?]

## Energy Consumption

### Total Energy Use
- [How much energy does civilization use?]
- Per capita consumption
- [Compared to 2025]

### Major Consumers
- Transportation
- Manufacturing
- Computing/data centers
- Climate control
- Food production
- [Where does the energy go?]

## Energy & Physics Constraints

### Why We're Still Earthbound
- Even if we had fusion energy, interstellar travel is impossible
- But we don't even have fusion
- Energy requirements for relativistic travel exceed solar capacity
- [The math that keeps us home]

### What Solar Energy Enables
- High quality of life (but constrained by daily solar input)
- Ecological engineering within Earth's energy budget
- Advanced computing (but limited by power available)
- Maintaining civilization
- [But always bounded by what the sun gives us]

### What Energy Doesn't Enable
- Fusion (impossible at human scales)
- FTL travel (physically impossible)
- Practical interstellar colonization (even with unlimited energy)
- Unlimited growth (solar input is finite per day)
- **The limitations compound**

## Energy Economics

### Cost of Energy
- **Energy is plentiful and cheap**
- Solar capacity continues to grow
- More and more arrays come online
- Total energy production continues upward trend
- This enables high standard of living
- But corporations still control distribution
- [Energy poverty in regions corporations don't serve?]

### Energy & Geopolitics
- **Controlled by gigantic multinational corporations**
- Private industry dominates space-based solar
- These corporations are a pillar of humanity
- **Indirectly control politics and major decisions**
- Set price and availability of energy
- Enormous power and influence
- [How are they regulated? Are they?]

## Environmental Impact

### Clean Energy Reality
- How clean is our energy?
- Waste products
- Environmental footprint
- [Trade-offs and compromises]

### Sustainability
- Can this energy system last forever?
- Resource constraints on energy tech
- [Long-term viability]

## Space-Based Energy

### Solar Power Satellites
- **Yes, they exist and are crucial**
- Massive orbital arrays capturing solar energy
- Beam power down via microwave/laser
- Scale: enormous (built over centuries)
- Provide significant percentage of Earth's power
- Maintained by orbital infrastructure
- [Who controls them? Nations? Global consortium?]
- Accidents/risks: beam targeting failures, orbital debris
- Geopolitical importance: energy from above

### Lunar Resources
- Helium-3 mining became irrelevant
- Was supposed to fuel fusion reactors
- Since fusion proved impossible, no need for He-3
- [Another abandoned dream]

## Energy & Daily Life

### Abundance or Scarcity?
- Is energy something people worry about?
- [Rationing or unlimited?]
- [How does energy access shape life?]

### Personal Energy Use
- [How do individuals use energy?]
- [Smart homes?]
- [Personal generators?]

## Open Questions
- Is energy the great liberator or still a constraint? **Both - abundant but bounded**
- What energy breakthrough defined this era? **Space-based solar arrays**
- What energy failure haunts this world? **Fusion - the promise that never delivered**
- How does energy abundance coexist with cosmic limitation? **We have enough for Earth, not enough for the stars**
- Does energy inequality drive conflict?
- What happens during solar storms that disrupt space arrays?
- How dependent are we on orbital infrastructure?

## The Energy Reality

### Living on Solar
- Civilization runs on the sun
- Every day the sun rises and gives us energy
- Every night we draw from storage
- We cannot use more than the sun provides
- This is the fundamental constraint
- **We are solar-powered beings on a solar-powered world**

### The Failed Promise
- Fusion was supposed to be unlimited energy
- "Just 30 years away" for 300 years
- Hundreds of billions invested
- The greatest scientific disappointment of the age
- We had to accept: only stars can fuse
- We are not stars
- We must live within our means
