# Demographics - Earth 3025

## Population

### Total Population
- **~12 billion humans in 3025**
- More than 2025's ~8 billion
- Growth despite climate crisis deaths

### What Shaped This Number
- Medicine extended lifespans (everyone lives to 100+)
- Disease elimination reduced mortality
- Designer babies eliminated birth defects
- **Abundant energy supports abundant population**
- Climate migration caused deaths but over centuries
- Wars and inequality still kill people
- By 3025: stabilized at higher level

### Population Trends
- Currently stable
- Natural balance between births and deaths (everyone dies by ~130)
- Energy and food production can support this level
- [Intentional management? Or natural?]

## Lifespan & Aging

### How Long Do People Live?
- **Average lifespan: 100+ years**
- Maximum: ~120-130 years (biological limits never conquered)
- Medical advances eliminated most diseases (cancer cured)
- But aging itself remains unconquered

### The Aging Reality
- **We never solved aging**
- Healthspan extended significantly
- People stay healthier longer
- But everyone still ages, declines, dies
- No immortality, no radical life extension beyond natural limits

### Age Structure
- More centenarians than ever
- [Age distribution of population]
- Multi-generational overlap
- [Still young people being born - the cycle continues]

### The Wisdom Problem
- **Limited lifespan = limited memory**
- Each generation must relearn
- Wisdom doesn't accumulate indefinitely
- Same mistakes repeated across centuries

## Demographics After the Asteroid (3025-3040)

### Year 1 (3025-3026): Demographic Crash Begins

**Birth Rates Plummet**
- Why bring children into doomed world?
- Most couples stop having children
- **But those who do: still want 'perfect' ones**
- **Genetic engineering continues**
- Tiny number of births
- These children will die as children
- Controversial? No. Just happens.

**Suicide Rates Skyrocket**
- Many cannot face 15 years of waiting
- Choose to end it now, on own terms
- Mass grief, mass despair
- Population declining from suicides
- Millions? Tens of millions?
- First year: significant population loss

**Age Structure Shifts**
- No new babies (almost)
- Young generation: shrinking
- Old people: dying naturally anyway
- Some grateful to die before impact
- Others wanted more time
- Middle-aged: most likely to survive to impact

**Migration Patterns Change**
- Where do you go when world is ending?
- Some flee Antarctica (to where?)
- Some flee to Antarctica (to see marvel before end)
- Some go home (family, roots, meaning)
- Some stay put (why move?)
- Movement chaotic, purposeless, or deeply purposeful

### Year 5 (3030): Reduced Population

**Population Status**
- ~12 billion in 3025
- Now: significantly reduced
- Suicides: millions dead
- Natural deaths: millions more (5 years of normal mortality)
- Births: almost none
- **Maybe 10-11 billion left?**
- Scattered, fragmented, fractured

**Age Structure**
- No children under 5 (almost)
- Few children at all
- What does childless world feel like?
- Empty schools
- Silent playgrounds
- No future generations
- Everyone alive: last generation

**Lifespan Questions**
- Still treating diseases? Sometimes
- Life extension: pointless
- People still aging
- Some die naturally before impact
- Lucky? Unlucky?
- Depends on perspective

**Geographic Distribution**
- Antarctica: population reduced
- "Holding together with string and duct tape"
- Some districts: empty
- Others: crowded
- Equatorial wars: killing thousands, millions?
- Population concentrations: unpredictable
- Depends on local conditions

### Year 10 (3035): Humanity Thinned

**Population Status**
- **How many humans left?**
- Natural deaths: continued (old age, accidents, violence)
- Suicides: continued
- War casualties: significant in some regions
- Births: almost zero
- **Maybe 8-9 billion?**
- One-third of humanity gone in 10 years
- One-third left to die in 5 years

**No Children**
- Youngest humans: teenagers
- Born just before or just after detection
- Grew up entirely under shadow
- Coming of age for what?
- What are they like?
- Different or same?

**The Aged**
- Many old people died naturally
- Completed their lifespans
- Missed the impact by years
- Was this better?
- No consensus

**Distribution**
- Small groups scattered
- Antarctica: significantly depopulated
- Equatorial regions: war-torn, reduced
- Temperate zones: varies
- Humanity spread thin
- Or concentrated in places
- No unified pattern

### Year 15 (3040): Final Humans

**How Many Alive?**
- 15 years of no births (almost)
- 15 years of suicides, violence, natural death
- **Maybe 6-8 billion?**
- Half of starting population
- All doomed
- All knowing
- All facing same end

**Age Structure**
- Youngest: ~15 years old
- Oldest: ~130 years old
- No babies, no young children
- Humanity aged
- Without youth
- Without future

**Geographic Distribution**
- Scattered globally
- Some alone
- Some in groups
- Antarctica: how many remain?
- Holy lands: fought over to the end
- Cities: abandoned or inhabited
- Countryside: reclaimed or occupied
- Humanity diverse in location
- As diverse as in response

**Final Moments**
- Where is everyone?
- What are they doing?
- Together or alone?
- All human possibilities
- All valid
- All ending

## Geographic Distribution (Pre-Asteroid)
- [This shapes history and conflict]

## Geographic Distribution

### Where People Live

#### Urban vs. Rural
- New megacities in northern latitudes
- Old cities abandoned or underwater
- [Percentage in cities vs. countryside]
- Urban concentration in habitable zones

#### Regional Populations - The Great Shift
**Densely Populated (New Centers):**
- **Antarctica (THE megacity - one continuous urban sprawl covering the continent)**
  - [Population: 3-4 billion? More?]
  - Thousands of artificial nature preserve islands within urban sprawl
  - Like hundreds of huge cities crammed together
  - Different cultures, politics, standards, norms
  - Built over centuries as climate forced migration
- Siberia (now temperate, major population)
- Northern Canada (prime real estate)
- Scandinavia (expanded population)
- Greenland (major population center)
- Northern United States (inland areas)
- Patagonia (cooler southern refuge)
- New Zealand (cooler refuge)

**Sparsely Populated But Still Inhabited:**
- Equatorial regions (dangerously hot)
- Remnants of humanity cling to ancestral lands
- Historical grievances keep them there
- This is where wars are fought
- [Population: few hundred million across equatorial zone?]

**Abandoned:**
- Former coastal zones (underwater)
- Low-lying islands (submerged)
- Extreme desert zones (uninhabitable heat)

#### Climate Refugees (Historical)
- **Mass migration over centuries (2100-2600?)**
- Coastal populations forced inland
- Tropical populations moved poleward
- Billions displaced over generations
- **Wars fought over habitable land**
- **Famine during transition periods**
- Some integration, much conflict
- Migration shaped modern world order
- [Who controls the north now?]
- [New nations formed? Old nations dissolved?]
