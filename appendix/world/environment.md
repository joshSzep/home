# Environment - Earth 3025

## Overview
After 1000 years and the acceptance of permanent habitation, what does Earth look like?

## Climate

### Climate Status in 3025
- **We did not stop global warming**
- **Earth is much hotter than 2025**
- Kept burning carbon until it ran out
- All trapped carbon and greenhouse gases released
- **Temperature increase: +5-6°C (worst case scenario)**
- Weather is more extreme, more energetic
- Atmospheric forces are violent

### The Hot Earth Reality
- Tropical zones expanded dramatically
- Temperate zones shifted poleward
- Former temperate regions now subtropical/tropical
- **Arctic and Antarctic: no ice, habitable**
- **Antarctica: temperate climate, massive population**
- Poles similar to 2025 temperate zones
- Equatorial zones: dangerously hot but still inhabited

### Climate Engineering
- Attempted geoengineering (limited success)
- Carbon capture too little, too late
- Can't reverse centuries of warming quickly
- Must adapt to hot Earth reality
- Stabilized at hot equilibrium but cannot cool it

## Environment After the Asteroid (3025-3040)

### Year 1 (3025-3026): Environment Unchanged

**Physical Earth: Same**
- Hot, still hot
- Sea levels: still high
- Weather: still extreme
- Asteroid doesn't change environment
- Yet

**Human Impact Changes**
- Industrial production: crashing
- Emissions: plummeting
- Why? Economic collapse
- Not intentional environmental action
- Just: humans stopping human activity
- Too late to matter anyway

**Nature Preserves**
- Antarctica's artificial preserves: what happens?
- Who maintains them?
- Automated systems continue
- Or: abandoned?
- Do people flood to nature for comfort?
- Or avoid it?

### Year 5 (3030): Industrial Collapse Effects

**Pollution Decreasing**
- Not because of environmental action
- Because civilization collapsing
- Factories stopped
- Transportation reduced
- Emissions: fraction of pre-asteroid
- Earth: slightly cleaner
- 15 years before it doesn't matter

**Abandoned Infrastructure**
- Industrial sites: quiet
- Mines: empty
- Oil rigs: automated or stopped
- Refineries: shutting down
- No one maintaining environmental protections
- Toxic sites: spreading contamination
- But will end before long-term consequences

**Wildlife Response**
- Human activity decreased
- Animals reclaiming spaces?
- But only 15 years total
- Not enough time for major changes
- Some expansion, some opportunistic species
- Earth won't recover - not enough time
- Will be destroyed first

### Year 10 (3035): Pre-Impact Environment

**Earth: Cleaner but Doomed**
- Five years of minimal human industry
- Air clearer
- Waters cleaner (relatively)
- But asteroid will devastate all
- The irony: we stopped destroying Earth
- Just in time for cosmic destruction

**Antarctica**
- Nature preserves: abandoned or tended?
- Megacity: partially empty
- Infrastructure: degrading
- Climate: still temperate
- Will be impact zone? Or just affected by global devastation?

**Ecosystem Status**
- Some species thriving (opportunistic)
- Others: still endangered
- But all will die
- All life on Earth: 5 years left
- Except maybe deep-sea bacteria

### Year 15 (3040): Final Environment

**Impact Coming**
- Asteroid visible in sky
- Growing larger
- Everyone can see doom approaching
- Weather: normal for 3025 (hot, extreme)
- Until impact

**The Impact**
- [Where does it hit?]
- Global devastation
- Extinction event
- All complex life: ended
- Maybe some bacteria survive
- Maybe not

**Earth After**
- Not our concern
- We won't see it
- Will Earth recover?
- Eventually
- Millions of years
- But not our Earth
- Our Earth ends with us

## Geography (Pre-Asteroid)

### Sea Levels
- **No permanent ice reserves on Earth**
- All ice melted over centuries (gradual, not sudden event)
- **Sea level rise: ~70 meters (+230 feet)**
- This is full melt of Greenland (~7m), Antarctica (~58m), glaciers (~1m), thermal expansion (~4m+)
- Current sea level vs. 2025: catastrophically higher
- Coastal changes: entire coastlines redrawn
- **This happened gradually over 200-400 years**

### Flooded Cities
- **All low-lying coastal cities: underwater and abandoned**
- New York, London, Shanghai, Miami, Mumbai, Bangkok, Amsterdam, Venice: submerged
- Evacuation happened over generations as waters rose
- Some cities tried seawalls, ultimately futile
- Ruins underwater - diving sites, archaeological zones
- Cultural grief over lost cities

### New Coastlines
- Coastlines moved dramatically inland
- [Former inland cities now coastal]
- New port cities built on high ground
- Maps completely redrawn from 2025

### Landmass Changes
- Coastal areas flooded
- Low-lying regions submerged
- Bangladesh: mostly underwater
- Netherlands: behind massive dikes or abandoned
- Pacific islands: vanished
- Florida: reduced to scattered islands or gone
- [Map the losses]

### Habitable Regions Shifted
- Former arctic/subarctic now temperate
- Siberia, northern Canada, Greenland: major population centers
- **Antarctica: THE major population center**
- **One continuous urban sprawl covering the continent**
- **The name of the continent = name of the megacity: Antarctica**
- Built over centuries as climate change gradually displaced humanity
- Powered by solar arrays built in parallel
- Raw necessity: few places on Earth suitable for human habitation
- Former temperate zones too hot in summer
- Equatorial regions: extreme heat, barely habitable (but people remain)
- Massive redistribution of where humans can live

## Biosphere

### Biodiversity in 3025
- Sixth extinction: severe losses
- Many species extinct (warming too fast to adapt)
- Some species migrated and survived
- Tropical species moved poleward
- Arctic/Antarctic species: extinct (no ice)
- Coral reefs: mostly dead
- De-extinction projects for some keystone species
- Engineered species to fill ecological niches

### Ecosystems
- **Ecosystems radically transformed**
- Tropical rainforests in new latitudes
- Deserts expanded in mid-latitudes
- Boreal forests pushed to former tundra
- Ocean ecosystems stressed but adapting
- Rewilding in newly habitable (former arctic) regions
- Managed ecosystems necessary for stability
- Wilderness exists, but it's new wilderness
- Protected zones (where possible)

### Oceans
- Ocean health
- Marine life status
- Ocean cleanup/restoration
- [What lives in the seas?]

## Human Footprint

### Land Use
- Much former coastal land underwater
- Humanity pushed inland and poleward
- New agricultural zones in former tundra
- Old agricultural zones too hot/dry
- Urban areas rebuilt in new locations
- Abandoned zones: former coasts, equatorial extremes

### Population Distribution
- **Mass migration occurred over centuries**
- Billions moved from coasts inland
- Billions moved from equator toward poles
- Northern latitudes (Siberia, Canada, Scandinavia) heavily populated
- Greenland: major population center
- Antarctica: [habitable? colonized?]
- Former population centers abandoned

### Migration's Legacy
- Generations-long refugee crises (now historical)
- Cultural mixing from forced displacement
- Political conflicts over habitable land
- Wars fought over territory? (human nature persists)
- New nations, redrawn borders
- [The migration shaped modern geopolitics]

### Resources & Extraction
- Mining
- Forestry
- Agriculture
- [How invasive are we?]

## "Forever Earth" Environmental Ethic

### Philosophy
- We must make this planet last forever
- Stewardship as sacred duty
- Deep ecology principles
- [Humans as part of nature, not separate]

### Policy
- Environmental protection laws
- Restoration mandates
- [How strictly enforced?]
- [Who decides land use?]

## Ecological Engineering

### Habitat Restoration
- Major restoration projects
- [Timeline of recovery]
- [Success stories]

### Agricultural Systems
- **Fully automated - AI/robotic fleets**
- **Human "farmers" are managers of vast automated systems**
- New agricultural zones in former tundra
- Old breadbaskets too hot/dry
- Vertical farming (energy intensive but viable with cheap solar)
- Lab-grown protein (reduces land use)
- Engineered crops for heat tolerance
- **Feeding 12 billion people is achieved**
- Famine still occurs in some regions (inequality, conflict, politics)
- But humanity overall fed
- Abundant energy makes food production abundant

### Waste & Circular Systems
- Zero waste mandates?
- Circular economy
- [How do we handle waste?]

## Challenges & Threats

### Ongoing Issues
- **Extreme weather is the norm**
- Hurricanes/typhoons more powerful
- Atmospheric energy from hot oceans
- Drought in some regions
- Flooding in others
- Wildfires (where vegetation exists)
- Heat waves that kill

### Disasters
- Natural disasters more frequent and severe
- Storm seasons are dangerous
- Infrastructure must withstand extreme forces
- Ecological stability fragile
- [Some ecosystems collapsed, some adapted]
- Cascading failures still possible

### The Violence of Nature
- Earth's atmosphere is energetic and angry
- Storms with unprecedented power
- Living with extreme weather as baseline
- [Shapes architecture, culture, daily life]

## Relationship With Nature

### Cultural Attitudes
- How do people view nature?
- [Connection vs. separation]
- [Wild areas as sacred?]

### Access to Nature
- Can people experience wilderness?
- [Parks, reserves]
- [Virtual nature?]

## Open Questions
- Is Earth healthier or sicker than today? **Different - not dying, but transformed**
- What's the most beautiful place in 3025? [New northern forests? Greenland valleys?]
- What's been lost that people mourn? **The ice. The coastlines. The old world.**
- What's been restored that people celebrate? [Some ecosystems, some species]
- Do people swim in the hot oceans?
- Are there underwater ruins tourism?
- How do cultures remember the old coastlines?

## The Survival Reality

### Despite Everything
- **Humanity continues to thrive**
- **We still dominate the planet**
- Adapted to hot Earth
- Built new cities, new infrastructure
- Fed the population (somehow)
- Survived the migration
- Survived the climate chaos
- **We endure**

### The Cost
- Billions suffered during transition
- Wars were fought
- Famine occurred
- But humanity survived
- Not unscathed, never unscathed
- But alive, still here, still dominant

### The Irony
- We couldn't leave Earth (physics)
- We couldn't stop warming Earth (kept burning)
- But we also couldn't destroy ourselves completely
- Human resilience and human destructiveness, both on display
- We live on a wounded world of our own making
- And we call it home
