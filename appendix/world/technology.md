# Technology - Earth 3025

## Technological Philosophy
What has advanced? What has been abandoned? What respects the physics constraints?

## Computing & AI

### Computing Power
- Highly advanced
- Quantum computing achieved
- Biological computing explored
- But fundamental limits exist

### Artificial Intelligence
- **Advanced AI exists, but no singularity**
- **AI scaling laws proven to be like the rocket equation**
- Energy requirements for true AGI/superintelligence exceed human capacity
- Even with theoretical foundations, can't reach the breakthrough
- AI is powerful tool, but not transcendent
- No AI god, no uploaded consciousness paradise
- Human-AI relationship: tools and assistants, not replacements

### The AI Scaling Wall
- Like trying to reach light speed
- Theoretically possible, practically impossible
- Energy costs grow exponentially
- [Another limit humanity hit]
- [Another dream that died]

### Virtual Reality
- **VR/metaverse dreams never caught on**
- Exists in some respect (games, specialized applications)
- Never hugely transformative
- Not unified - fragmented like 2025
- (World of Warcraft to Chess.com to online casinos equivalent)
- People prefer physical reality
- [Why didn't it catch on? Human preference for real?]

## Biotechnology & Medicine

### Human Enhancement (Pre-Asteroid)
- **Genetic engineering extremely common**
- **Designer babies are standard**
- **Birth defects are a thing of the past**
- Parents choose traits, eliminate diseases
- Height, intelligence, appearance can be optimized
- **But still no conquest of aging - everyone still dies**
- Cognitive enhancement through genetics
- Physical augmentation (exists but limits remain)

### Medicine (Pre-Asteroid)
- **Cancer cured**
- **Most life-threatening diseases eliminated**
- **Genetic diseases eliminated before birth**
- Regenerative medicine advanced
- But aging remains unconquered
- Average lifespan: 100+ years
- Maximum: ~120-130 years (biological hard limit)
- Healthcare access: universal in most regions

## Technology After the Asteroid (3025-3040)

### Year 1 (3025-3026): Technology Persists

**Automated Systems Continue**
- AI monitoring systems: detected asteroid
- Infrastructure automation: keeps running
- Not because humans direct it
- Because that's what it does
- **Proof: technology doesn't need us**

**Genetic Engineering Continues**
- **Birth rates plummet**
- But those who choose children still want 'perfect' ones
- **Designer babies don't stop**
- **Doesn't become controversial**
- Just continues
- Human behavior unchanged even in extinction

**Medical Services Collapse**
- Why cure disease in doomed patients?
- Some doctors leave
- Others stay (calling, habit, compassion)
- Hospitals: some functioning, others abandoned
- Medicine: available where infrastructure intact
- But motivation: complicated

**AI Still Functioning**
- **Doesn't care about asteroid**
- Keeps processing, monitoring, optimizing
- Translation services: still working
- Information systems: still operating
- The most reliable element of civilization
- Because it's not alive to fear death

### Year 5 (3030): Automated Reliability

**Infrastructure Maintained**
- **By machines, not humans**
- Solar arrays: machines maintaining machines
- Water treatment: automated where functional
- Power grids: AI-managed
- Manufacturing: automated production continues
- Human oversight: minimal or gone

**Genetic Engineering**
- Still happening where clinics functional
- Tiny number of births
- All designer babies
- Parents want perfection for doomed children
- Makes sense or doesn't
- Continues anyway

**Medical Care**
- Hospitals mostly abandoned
- But automated pharmacies: still distributing
- AI diagnosis: still available
- Robotic surgery: possible where powered
- Human medical staff: rare
- Finding meaning in healing? Or just habit?

**AI Systems**
- Most still operational
- Language translation: functioning
- Data processing: continuing
- Monitoring systems: watching everything
- Including asteroid approach
- Precise countdown to impact

### Year 10 (3035): Technology Degrading

**Systems Breaking Down**
- Without human maintenance of maintenance systems
- Cascading failures
- Some regions: technology still works
- Others: dark, silent, broken
- Depends on local conditions
- Automated repair can only do so much

**No New Technology**
- Research stopped years ago
- Innovation: pointless
- Labs: abandoned
- Universities: empty
- Why develop what won't be used?

**AI Still Watching**
- Asteroid tracking: precise
- Countdown accurate
- No errors
- Machine certainty about human extinction
- Still processing
- Still not caring

### Year 15 (3040): Technology to the End

**What Still Functions**
- Some AI systems (where powered)
- Some automated infrastructure
- Random, scattered, degraded
- But more reliable than human structures
- Our tools outlast our civilization

**Final Countdown**
- AI calculated impact: exact
- Humans know precise moment
- Technology's last gift: certainty
- We know exactly when we die

## Transportation (Pre-Asteroid)

### The Mortality Reality
- We can prevent diseases
- We can engineer perfect health
- We cannot prevent aging
- We cannot prevent death
- Everyone ages, everyone dies
- No immortality, no escape from time

### Ethical Implications
- Designer babies raise questions of equality
- Who can afford best genetic enhancements?
- [Genetic haves vs. have-nots?]
- [Regulated? Or free market?]

### Synthetic Biology
- Engineered organisms
- Biological manufacturing
- Terraforming Earth (re-engineering ecosystems)

## Materials Science

### Advanced Materials
- [What new materials exist?]
- Self-healing materials
- Programmable matter?
- [Nanotech status]

## Transportation

### Ground Transportation
- **Everything is electric**
- **Private vehicle ownership exceedingly rare**
- Public transit dominant (efficient, convenient, free or cheap)
- Autonomous vehicles (shared/fleet-based)
- High-speed rail between major centers
- Walking, cycling in cities
- Why private ownership rare:
  - Economics (why own when shared is cheap/free?)
  - Culture (seen as wasteful, unnecessary)
  - Urban design (cities built for public transit)
  - Convenience (autonomous shared vehicles on-demand)

### Aviation
- **Everything is electric**
- Electric aircraft (battery or beamed power?)
- Air travel viable with cheap abundant solar energy
- **Long-distance travel is very common**
- Aviation thrives on plentiful energy

### Space Transportation
- [See space-program.md]
- Orbital access
- [Why it's limited]

## Energy Technology
- [See energy.md for details]

## Communication
- Global communication networks
- [How do people stay connected?]
- [Bandwidth/latency]

## Abandoned Technologies

### What We Gave Up
- Technologies that served interstellar dreams
- Unsustainable tech
- [What proved impractical?]

## Constraints & Limits

### Physics Boundaries
- What can't we do?
- Why not?
- [Hard science grounding]

### Resource Limits
- Technology limited by materials
- [Energy constraints on capability]

## Living With Technology

### Daily Life
- How does tech shape everyday existence?
- [Ubiquity vs. invisibility]
- [Human-tech balance]

### Social Impacts
- How has technology changed culture?
- [Digital divide issues?]
- [Technology and meaning]

## Open Questions
- What's the most impressive tech in this world?
- What technology drives your plot?
- What failed that people expected to succeed?
