## CONCLUSION

These aren't just names filling seats. Each person has story, struggle, transformation. Each learns presence differently. Each teaches others something unique. The community is web of interconnection—Min-seo's mint, Derek's walks, Fatima's dinners, Maya's rage, Ibrahim's faith-loss-and-return, all of it weaving together into something larger than any individual.

By Year 15, the teaching isn't Kenji alone anymore. It's community practicing together. Wei's garden grew beyond her tending. Now 200 people tend presence together until presence ends.

That's Picture 10. That's marketplace with gift-bestowing hands. That's teaching until the light takes everything.
