# Soso Kim - Character Summary

## Overview
I've added **Soso Kim** as a comprehensive side character to your novel *Home*. She's been fully integrated into AGENTS.md and has a detailed character arc document in `outlines/SOSO-KIM-ARC.md`.

## Key Character Details

**Basic Info:**
- Korean-American, age 35→50 (Year -35 birth to Year 15 impact)
- District 12 Dog Adoption Center administrator, Antarctica
- Orphaned age 2 in transport accident (Year -33)
- Fierce environmentalist carrying "born too late" grief

**Character Arc:**
1. **Part I (Year 0)**: Faces spikes in both abandonments and adoptions post-detection; maintains standards despite crisis; center becomes refuge for both animals and humans seeking presence with life
2. **Part II (Years 1-7)**: Standards gradually erode; questions purpose; volunteers keep coming; begins noticing people seek presence with life, not adoption outcomes
3. **Part III (Years 8-15 M1)**: Encounters Kenji's teaching Year 9; struggles with grief for lost species; Year 12 breakthrough—witnessing current life transforms ecological mourning; Year 14 center becomes satellite teaching space
4. **Part IV (Year 15)**: Brings 12 permanent resident dogs to convergence site; teaches environmental grief transformed through presence; embodies caretaking as spiritual practice

## Thematic Function

### What She Reveals:
- **Earth 3025's environmental devastation** - Completed climate collapse, extinct biodiversity, Antarctica as habitable megacity
- **Ecological impermanence** - Species extinction at planetary scale made visceral
- **"Born too late" grief** - Wishes she'd lived centuries earlier to witness extinct species (polar bears extinct 2847, elephants 2891, coral reefs dead by 2750, etc.)

### What She Teaches:
- **Presence as answer to loss** - Can't bring back extinct species, but can fully witness remaining life
- **Caretaking as practice** - Tending animals becomes embodied presence (parallels Wei's gardening)
- **Any life fully witnessed = all life witnessed** - Final understanding: These dogs, this moment—this is enough

## Key Relationships

- **Dog Adoption Center community**: Volunteers (elderly seeking purpose, refugee families, ex-professionals) who come for being-with-life, not outcomes
- **Kenji's teaching circle**: Encounters Year 9, regular attendance Years 12-15; teaches environmental grief transformed, caretaking as practice
- **The 12 final dogs**: Brings permanent resident dogs (unadoptable: old, sick, behavioral issues) to convergence site—they lived with humanity, they'll be witnessed too

## World-Building Contribution

Through Soso's perspective, you can reveal:
- Lost species with specific extinction dates (I've provided a detailed list in the arc document)
- Climate collapse timeline 2200-3025
- What "wilderness" means in post-wild world
- Emotional reality of living after planetary biodiversity loss
- Antarctic architecture, dog breeding in 3025, adaptation to habitable-but-not-comfortable climate

## Connection to Novel's Themes

**"Home" (Ninth Ox-Herding Picture):**
Soso's arc embodies ecological displacement and return:
- Decades wishing she'd been born in different time → Displacement from present
- Grieving home-earth she never knew → Attachment to lost past  
- Through practice, returns to home-here → Present moment, current life
- Final teaching: Home was never the lost wilderness—home is presence with life that remains

Her journey parallels Kenji's but through ecological seeking rather than philosophical: both sought something "elsewhere," both discovered home is here, now, present.

## Potential Chapter Appearances

**Part I**: Brief mention Ch 6 or 9 (adoption center chaos, 200-300 words)
**Part II**: Background reference or brief scene Ch 20 or 22 (community space)
**Part III**: Teaching circle scenes Ch 36, 42; possible dedicated scene Ch 40 or 42 (center as teaching space)
**Part IV**: Assembly Ch 46 (brings dogs), teaching moment Ch 48-49 (environmental grief), final presence Ch 55 (with dogs and community)

   - Year-by-year development (Years -35 to 15)
   - Thematic function analysis
   - Potential chapter appearances
   - 12 final dogs with names and details
   - Writing notes (voice, physical details, environmental details to reveal)
   - Connection to novel's title and Ox-Herding Pictures

## Next Steps

When writing chapters featuring Soso:
- Reference `outlines/SOSO-KIM-ARC.md` for timeline precision and story beats
- Use her perspective to reveal environmental backstory naturally (through her grief/knowledge)
- Show center community as microcosm of presence practice (volunteers tending life)
- Her teaching: Embodied, through caretaking, less verbal than Kenji's (action over words)
- Physical details: Hands smell like dog, practical clothes, scar on left forearm, tired eyes (early) softening (later)

The character is fully developed and ready to be woven into existing and future chapters. Her arc complements your other side characters (Daniel = violence/justice crisis, Linnea = addiction crisis, Yuki = pediatrics/development crisis, Soso = extinction/environmental crisis) while adding crucial world-building about Earth 3025's ecological state.
