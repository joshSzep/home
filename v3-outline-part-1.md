## PART I: DETECTION
**Chapters 1-8 | ~40,000 words | Year 1**

The world learns. The world reacts. The world fractures.

---

## Chapter 1: Detection
**POV: Amara Okafor (52) | Year 1, Day 1 | ~4,500 words**

**Opening**: 3:47 AM, Antarctic Monitoring Station. Amara alone on graveyard shift—her preference after twenty years. Quiet hum, screens glowing, tea cooling. Reviewing routine data on asteroid 2024-KJ9.

**The Alert**: High-priority detection (rare—three times in twenty years). New object: mass ~1.5 × 10^15 kg, 10-15 km diameter, velocity 28.3 km/s. Impact probability climbing: 94.3%... 96.1%... 98.7%...

**Verification**: Amara runs protocols with expertise. System errors: none. Three telescope stations confirm. Parallax, spectral analysis, brightness curve. Manual calculation confirms AI. Impact probability: 99.97%. Time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days.

**The Impossibility**: Hands shaking. Tea cooling. Opening deflection calculator. Every scenario fails: kinetic impactor (too massive), nuclear deflection (insufficient yield), gravity tractor (needs 50+ years). Physics is absolute. No solutions exist.

**Protocol**: Emergency notifications activate. Calls to UN, space agencies, governments. Amara delivers data clinically. "Are you certain?" "Yes." The calls end. Amara sits in silent station.

**Personal Cost**: Should call sister Zara—haven't spoken in six months. Estrangement: different paths, unspoken resentment. Amara chose career over family, Antarctica over Lagos. Now fifteen years until everyone dies. Including Zara. Including niece Maya (whom Amara barely knows). She stares at Zara's contact. Can't press call. Returns to data.

**Key beats**: Competence vs. isolation • Antarctica's cold beauty • Physics as indifferent force • Calculation as emotional armor • First human to know everyone is dying

---

## Chapter 2: Reactions
**POV: Zara Okafor-Mensah (34) | Year 1, Day 1 | ~4,000 words**

**Ordinary Morning**: Lagos District (engineered tropical climate). Zara's bright apartment. She and Maya (2) building towers—Maya's fierce concentration, tongue out. Kwame making breakfast. Engineering schematics on tablet (Zara designs water reclamation). Family life, beautiful and ordinary.

**The Broadcast**: Emergency alert interrupts. All screens activate. EXTINCTION-LEVEL ASTEROID DETECTED. Impact probability 99.97%. Fifteen years. UN official: verification complete, deflection impossible.

**Comprehension**: Zara's engineering mind processes the physics—energy scales, impact force. Understands "civilization-killer" means exactly that. Maya will be 17. Never turn 18. Never fall in love. Seventeen, then nothing.

**Maya's Fear**: "Mama, what's wrong?" Zara realizes she's crying. Holds Maya too tight. "Mama, too tight!" Impossibility of explaining. Maya senses fear without understanding.

**Kwame**: "Come home right now." He arrives in twenty minutes. They hold each other, Maya between them. "What do we do?" "I don't know."

**The Calls**: Everyone calling everyone. Parents in Mumbai. Kwame's family scattered. Friends desperate. Comm systems overloading. No one has answers.

**Amara**: Zara thinks of her sister the astrophysicist. Did Amara detect it? They haven't spoken in six months—argument about priorities. Zara sent messages ("Maya's first steps!"). Amara's responses: brief, distracted. Distance grown wide. Now Zara wants to call but doesn't know what to say. "My sister calculated our death." Complicated feelings: anger, grief, desperate love.

**Evening**: Maya finally asleep. Zara and Kwame on balcony. Lagos District usually vibrant, now stunned quiet. Kwame: "Should we have another child?" The question hangs. "Bring a baby into a dying world?" "I'm asking if life still matters." A child born now would be fourteen. Never reach fifteen. Cruel or defiant? She doesn't know yet.

**Key beats**: Warmth vs. isolation • Lagos District's vibrancy • Family bonds under strain • Maya as fully realized • Seeds of defiant choice • Need to reconnect with Amara

---

## Chapter 3: Crisis of Faith — Ibrahim
**POV: Ibrahim al-Rashid (19) | Year 1, Day 1 | ~3,800 words**

**Evening Prayers**: Jerusalem hills militia camp. Ibrahim kneeling with brothers, facing Mecca. *Allahu Akbar*. Words automatic after lifetime practice. Foundation, purpose, certainty.

**Ibrahim's Faith**: Raised devout. Joined militia at 16, defending holy land. Jerusalem contested three millennia, still contested. Forever Earth made it permanently significant. This land sacred, this fight righteous. Martyrdom leads to paradise. Faith complete, total, unquestioned.

**The Broadcast**: Commander interrupts prayers. 150 fighters gather at command tent. UN broadcast: asteroid, extinction, fifteen years. Imam: "This is test. Allah's will. The faithful rewarded in paradise." Others nodding, accepting. Ibrahim tries to feel certainty. But: crack forming.

**The Question**: If everyone dies—Muslim, Christian, Jew, atheist—what's difference? Holy land: vaporized. Sacred sites: destroyed. Jerusalem, Mecca, all physics. If this is Allah's plan, what are they? Puppets? Theological framework wobbling.

**After**: Others resume normal activities. Commander: "We fight until the end." Ibrahim: "The land we're defending will be destroyed." "Then we defend it until it is. That's faith." "That's denial." Commander's face hardens. "Watch your words, brother."

**Prayer Beads**: *Misbaha*—99 beads for 99 names of God. Held since childhood. Worn in combat. Prayed with after every raid. Now: feel like stones. Just weight. Prayers just words without meaning.

**Imam's Counsel**: "Don't let asteroid steal your faith. That's death before death." "What if faith doesn't make sense?" "Faith isn't about sense. It's about surrender to Allah's will." "What if I can't surrender to this?"

**Closing**: Alone in tent. Prayer beads in hand. Can't find words. Crack widening. Fights for sacred land that won't exist. Believes in paradise no longer certain of. Serves Allah whose plan seems cruel. First night: faith breaking. Still trying to pray. Beads feeling like stones.

**Key beats**: Sincere faith portrayed respectfully • Jerusalem's significance • Youth and idealism • Crack beginning, not instant atheism • Surrender vs. seeming cruelty • Setup for journey from faith to presence

---

## Chapter 4: Crisis of Faith — Kenji
**POV: Kenji Torres (24) | Year 1, Day 1-2 | ~4,000 words**

**The Lab**: Past midnight. Kenji working on dissertation: "Theoretical Deflection Scenarios for Near-Earth Objects." Academic exercises assuming humanity has time. Dr. Amara Okafor (his mentor) reviewing data across lab. Focused silence.

**The Moment**: Dr. Okafor makes sharp sound, face draining color. Kenji crosses lab. She pulls up data without speaking. He understands immediately—four years studying threats. Extinction-level. 99.97%. 15 years. "Can we stop it?" "No." Absolute. Final.

**Understanding**: Dissertation irrelevant. Research meaningless. Future career nonexistent. Fifteen years. He'll be 39. Mother: 78. Father died at 62 (transit accident, Kenji age 5)—mother said not fair, too young, should've had more time. She grieved for years. Now: loses son and herself. Unfairness absolute.

**Going to Mom**: Dr. Okafor follows protocols, professional mask. "Your mother needs to know." "I'll go to her." Transit almost empty—late night travelers, some know, some don't. Kenji can tell from faces.

**Elena**: Mayor of Antarctica. Most powerful human on Earth. Mother of Kenji. Answers door in robe. Sees his face. "Come in, mijo." He tells everything. She listens without interrupting. Silence. "So my power means nothing. I govern four billion and can't save any." "No one can save anyone." "I wanted grandchildren," voice small. They sit together. Antarctic megacity visible through windows—billions of lights spanning the continent, all temporary. Elena makes tea. Don't talk much. "The briefings don't matter anymore." But she'll hold them anyway.

**Return**: Kenji walks back—4 AM, Antarctic twilight, streets empty, screens showing panic. Returns to lab. Okafor gone. Dissertation still open: Chapter 3, "Long-Term Deflection Strategies." He closes it. Never opens again.

**Closing**: Twenty-four years old. PhD almost complete. Career ahead. Marriage someday, children someday. All "somedays" gone. What now? The question he'll spend seven years trying to answer through parties, substances, travel, seeking.

**Key beats**: Intelligence and bright future lost • Mentor/student warmth • Mother-son bond • Elena's power meaningless • Purpose-based crisis • Setup for seeking journey • Father's death as formative trauma

---

## Chapter 5: Wisdom
**POV: Professor Mei-Lin Wei (114) | Year 1, Day 2 | ~3,800 words**

**The Garden**: Morning, Wei's Lagos District balcony—10m × 10m, native flowers, vegetables, small lemon tree. Ten years here (moved from Beijing). Everything impermanent, returning to soil. Wei watering gardenias with deliberate movements.

**Wei's Body**: 114 years old. Knees complaining, back aching, hands shaking. Cane in left hand, watering can in right. Each step careful. Life extension common but not miraculous. Body knows its age constantly. But mind: clear, sharp, present. That's what matters.

**Wei's Practice**: Seventy years teaching philosophy. Forty years Buddhist practice. Lifetime preparation for impermanence. Not religious (no rebirth), philosophical. Observation of truth: everything changes.

**The Alert**: House system chimes. Whole building lighting up. Wei sets down watering can carefully. Walks inside. Reads: extinction-level asteroid, 15 years, deflection impossible. Reads twice. Then: turns off screen. Returns to garden. Finishes watering. The gardenias still need water. Philosophy made concrete. Asteroid doesn't change present needs. Attend to now.

**Zara's Arrival**: "Professor Wei!" Zara bursting through door (neighbors, friends). Maya (2) on hip, both crying. "An asteroid! Fifteen years! Everyone dies!" Voice rising toward hysteria. "My daughter will die! She's two! She'll be seventeen!" Collapses on garden bench sobbing. Wei sits beside them, not touching yet, just present. Grief has to move through before wisdom enters.

**The Teaching**: "How are you so calm?" "I'm 114. I was going to die soon anyway." "But this is everyone! This is Maya!" "Is it different? Really? Maya was always going to die. The asteroid just makes it visible. Makes the date certain. But impermanence was always there." "You're saying this doesn't change anything?" "Everything was always impermanent. Most people pretend otherwise. Now we can't pretend." "That's not comfort." "No. But it's truth."

**The Flower**: Wei gestures to gardenias. "They bloomed yesterday. Tomorrow, browning. Three days, fallen. Two weeks, memory. Same cycle every year. Buds, bloom, beauty, death. Asteroid doesn't change the flower's nature. Just makes us pay attention."

**The Invitation**: "Come to my garden every day. Bring Maya. Watch flowers bloom and die. Watch lemon tree fruit and rest. Practice seeing impermanence. Practice being present anyway. Won't make asteroid disappear. But might make fifteen years richer." Zara crying softer: "Will you teach me?" "I will teach you nothing. But I will sit with you while you learn."

**Closing**: Zara and Maya leave (Zara steadier, not fixed but present). Wei alone in garden. Gardenias blooming. Lemon tree heavy. Everything temporary, beautiful, here now. "Fifteen years. That's quite a lot of time, actually." Returns to watering.

**Key beats**: Age and earned wisdom • Physical frailty, mental clarity • Buddhist philosophy as observation • Garden as teaching tool • Calm as practice • Relationship with Zara beginning • Impermanence made visible • Natural death coming Year 11

---

## Chapter 6: Life Choices
**POV: Amara Okafor (52) | Year 1, Day 45 | ~5,000 words**

**UN Summit**: Six weeks after detection. Geneva-Antarctica conference. Every space-capable nation, corporations, universities desperate for solutions. Amara's presented 47 times—always same data, same conclusion. Asteroid 3025-AZ1: 15km diameter, 28.3 km/s velocity, 99.97% impact probability. Full presentation: orbital mechanics, impact energy (400 million megatons), deflection scenarios (all failed), extinction timeline (12-18 months post-impact).

**The Question**: "Are you absolutely certain?" "Yes." "Could calculations be wrong?" "No. Seven independent verifications." "Is there ANY chance?" "Below 0.1%. Effectively zero." "That's not zero." "Close enough that pursuing it wastes time we have." Room erupts: shouting, accusations, denial. Russian representative walks out. "We should try anyway." "Try what? Build spacecraft we can't build? Detonate weapons we don't have? Pray?"

**After**: Secretary General: "History will remember you." "As bearer of bad news?" "As person who told truth. That matters." "Does it? Truth doesn't stop asteroids." "No. But lies won't either."

**Fame**: Six weeks of presentations, conferences, interviews. "The woman who detected the apocalypse." Hate mail daily (her fault somehow). Death threats (ironic). Also gratitude (some appreciate truth). She reads none. Returns to data.

**Isolation Deepens**: Station population: 60 → 30 → 15 scientists. Some quit, some fled, some died (suicides mostly). Amara stays. Always stays. Updating calculations that don't need updating. Working because it's what she does.

**Zara's Messages**: Thirty-seven unread. Day 1: "Did you detect it? Are you okay?" Then: "Please call." "Maya's asking about aunt." "I'm pregnant. Having another baby. I know it's crazy." "I need my sister." "Please. Just call." Amara reads them. Can't respond. What would she say? "Sorry I calculated your children's deaths?" Closes messages. Returns to data.

**David**: Husband twelve years. Maintenance engineer, solar arrays. Live together, pass like strangers. "Morning." "Morning." "I'll be late." "Okay." When did they stop being married? Amara doesn't remember. Data needs attention.

**Statistics**: Tracking more than asteroid now. Global death rates (up 340%). Suicide rates (catastrophic). Birth rates (plummeting). Migration (chaotic). Infrastructure failures (accelerating). Processes it scientifically. Numbers, data, trends. Doesn't let herself feel. Can't. If she feels, she'll break.

**Closing**: 3:47 AM. Six weeks later. Alone at workstation. Station almost empty. Should call Zara. Should go home to David. Should stop working. But: what else is there? Data doesn't judge. Numbers don't ask questions. Calculations don't need love. They just need solving. She solves them. Again and again. 14 years, 11 months, 29 days remaining.

**Key beats**: Face of apocalypse • Isolation as defense • UN response (denial/anger/bargaining) • Zara relationship broken (Amara's choice) • Marriage broken (mutual avoidance) • Work as armor • Setup for ten-year isolation

---

## Chapter 7: Leadership — Elena
**POV: Elena Torres (63) | Year 1, Day 60 | ~4,200 words**

**Morning Briefing**: 7 AM, Mayor's conference room. Designed for 50, holds 30. Eight years as mayor. Morning briefings: favorite ritual. Structure, order, governance. Until now.

**Reports Before**: Zoning policy, infrastructure upgrades, budget allocations, ten-year projections. Building Forever Earth, building for millennia. The work meant something.

**Reports After**: Power grid 89% (crews abandoning). Water stable (losing engineers). Transit 67% (drivers not showing). Food functional (six months reserves). Security up 180% crime (60% force strength). Population 3.7B (down from 4.2B). Where are they going? Why track this?

**Why Am I Here?**: Marcus asks why she stays. "We can't save anyone." "No. But someone should document collapse. Someone should bear witness. Someone should say: dignity mattered until the end. That's governance now—not power, not solutions. Just: presence. Showing up. Recording." "Is that enough?" "It has to be."

**Apartment**: Lives alone (divorced 20 years). Spacious (mayor's privilege). Continental views: the megacity sprawling endlessly, magnificent. Used to love it (sanctuary). Now: too quiet, empty, too much time to think. Works until midnight. Returns exhausted. Sleeps four hours. Repeats.

**Marcus**: Assistant, 32, brilliant. Could've left, stays. "Mayor Torres, interviews at nine." "Tell them I'm busy." "They want to know how you're governing." "Governing? I'm witnessing collapse." Marcus: "I'll tell them you're managing transition." "To what?" "To whatever comes next." "Nothing comes next, Marcus." "Then maintaining dignity until end." "Why are you still here?" "Because someone should witness you witnessing. And you're my mayor."

**Power**: Fought for position. Ran three campaigns (lost two, won third). Wanted to help, serve, make difference. Governed 4M with competence. Now: utterly powerless. Can't stop asteroid. Can't save anyone. Most powerful human on Earth. Completely helpless.

**Kenji**: Her son, 24, PhD candidate (was—abandoned). Used to visit weekly. Since detection: seen twice, distant, hollow, high. Rumors: parties, substances, destructive. Wants to help. Doesn't know how. Won't take calls. "How are you, mijo?" "Fine." But he's not. Neither is she.

**Apartment**: Lives alone (divorced 20 years). Spacious (mayor's privilege). Continental views: the megacity sprawling endlessly, magnificent. Used to love it (sanctuary). Now: too quiet, empty, too much time to think. Works until midnight. Returns exhausted. Sleeps four hours. Repeats.

**Wei's Letters**: Started two weeks ago. Professor Mei-Lin Wei, Lagos District. Never met. Simple letters, philosophical observations. "Dear Mayor Torres, I understand burden of responsibility... What you're doing matters, not because it changes outcome... But because bearing witness is itself meaningful..." Doesn't respond. But: they help. Someone seeing her. Someone understanding.

**Evening**: 11 PM, still in office. Marcus gone. Elena at window. 3.7 billion people. All her responsibility. All dying. Can't save them. Can barely help. But: she'll show up tomorrow. Hold briefing. Ask questions. Maintain structure. Theater of governance. Because what else?

**Closing**: City glows below. Millions of lights. Each one life. Each one temporary. All her responsibility. All beyond her power to save. Tomorrow: another briefing. Another day governing nothing. Another day bearing witness. Because someone has to. Even when meaningless. Especially then.

**Key beats**: Competence vs. futility • Staff abandoning except Marcus • Powerlessness despite position • Estrangement from Kenji • Wei's letters beginning • Theater as dignity • Power to witness • Responsibility without agency

---

## Chapter 8: Leadership — Kenji
**POV: Kenji Torres (24) | Year 1, Days 60-75 | ~4,500 words**

**The Party**: Week 10. Kenji doesn't know whose apartment. Doesn't know half the people. Doesn't care. Music pounding (Lagos-Antarctica fusion). Lights strobing. Bodies everywhere: dancing, coupling, collapsing. Substances everywhere. Everyone young. Everyone desperate to feel something other than terror.

**The Descent**: First party Day 3 (one night escape). Second Day 5 (why not?). Fifth Day 12 (what else?). Thirtieth Day 45 (who's counting?). Now: Day 70-something (lost count).

**The Pattern**: Wake up somewhere (apartment, floor, stranger's bed). Don't remember getting there. Head pounding. Hands shaking. Check time (afternoon). Check messages (Mom calling, ignore). Get up barely. Find next party. Repeat.

**Who Kenji Was**: PhD candidate, asteroid deflection theory. Brilliant. Dedicated. Close with mother (weekly dinners). Healthy (ran daily). Purpose-driven. That Kenji: gone.

**Who Kenji Is**: 24 years old. 15 years left (die at 39). Dissertation abandoned. Research meaningless. Knowledge worthless. Purpose gone. Fitness gone. Sleep gone (pass out, not sleep). Mother calling (can't face her). Just: parties, substances, bodies, noise. Anything to stop thinking.

**This Party**: Girl approaches (22). "You're Elena Torres's son?" Nods. "Must be weird. Your mom running dying city." Laughs bitter: "Must be weird being anyone right now." Offers pill (doesn't say what). "Makes you forget for while." "How long?" "Few hours. Maybe six." "I'll take three."

**The High**: Time fractures. Music becomes texture. Bodies become patterns. Thoughts stop (finally). Just: sensation without meaning. Color without context. Sound without narrative. Perfect emptiness. Better than thinking. Better than feeling. Better than being.

**The Crash**: Hours later. Coming down. Bathroom floor (someone's, doesn't know whose). Head on toilet. Shaking. Empty. This is what he is now. All he is. Dr. Kenji Torres, PhD candidate. Reduced to bathroom floor, coming down, alone.

**Someone Finds Him**: Door opens. "Hey, you okay?" Guy, 26, concerned. "Fine" (lie). "You don't look fine. When's last time you ate?" Can't remember. "Come on. Let's get you food." "Why care?" "Because you're dying on my bathroom floor and I'm not ready for corpses yet."

**Food**: Guy (name: Marcus? Matthew? Mike?) gets bread, synth-protein, water. Kenji eats mechanically. "How long you been doing this?" "Doing what?" "The parties. The substances. The running from death." "Since detection." "How's that working?" "Terribly. But what else is there?" Guy considers: "Living?" "We're all dying." "Yeah. But we're all living too. For now."

**Brief Clarity**: Food helps. Water helps. Sitting quiet (guy's apartment, separate from party). Head clearing slightly. "You should go home." "I don't have home anymore." "You have your mom." "Can't face her. Can't face disappointment." "You think she's disappointed? Or worried?" Doesn't answer. "She's your mom. She loves you. Go home." "What if home doesn't help?" "What if it does?"

**Not Going Home**: Thanks guy (genuine). Leaves. Walks through Lagos District streets (dawn approaching). Should go to Mom's. Should call. Should stop destroying himself. But: terror still there. Knowing everyone dies. Fifteen years counting down. Meaninglessness absolute. Home won't fix that. Nothing will. So: finds next party.

**Closing**: Message from mother (days later). "Mijo, please call me. I love you. I'm here." Stares at it. Wants to call. Can't. What would he say? "Sorry I'm wasting my fifteen years?" "Sorry I can't handle truth you have to govern?" "Sorry I'm not strong like you?" Closes message. Returns to party. Returns to forgetting. 14 years, 10 months remaining. But who's counting?

**Key beats**: Complete breakdown (contrast to competence) • Party scene (vivid, desperate, real) • Spiral into meaninglessness • Avoidance of Elena (guilt, shame) • Temporary escape substances provide • Brief clarity (stranger's kindness) • Choice to continue spiraling • Setup for seeking journey • The question: "What else is there?"

## Chapter 9: One Year After
**POV: Rotating (Seven vignettes) | Year 1, Day 365 | ~4,000 words**

### Amara — Antarctic Station, 3:47 AM
Exactly one year since detection. At workstation (where else?). Station: her and two others. Screens show: 14 years, 0 months, 0 days. One year gone. Fourteen left. She's updated trajectory 10,847 times. Every update: same result. Why keep calculating? No answer. But: still calculating. Reflection in dark screen—barely recognizes herself. Hasn't seen Zara in year (not in person). Hasn't really talked to David (they coexist). Hasn't felt anything (numbness is protection). Isolation complete. Data her only companion. "One year," she says to empty station. No one answers. Screens hum. Countdown continues.

### Zara — Lagos Garden, Morning
Four months pregnant with Kofi. Maya (3) playing in Wei's garden. Come here every day. Morning ritual: watch flowers, drink tea, be present. Wei teaching Maya about gardenias. "See how petals fall?" "They're dying?" "They're completing. Different thing." Zara's hand on growing belly. She and Kwame decided: have the baby. Everyone called them cruel. Newspapers: "Selfish Parents Condemn Child to Short Life." Protests outside building. Death threats. But: chose life anyway. Baby kicking now. Defiant little flutter. "I feel him, Mama!" Maya says (hand on belly). "That's your brother." "Will he play with me?" "Yes, baby. For as long as we have." Wei watching, silent approval. Not easy decision. But made. Four months until Kofi arrives. Thirteen years after that until he leaves. But now: kicking, alive, here.

### Elena — Mayor's Office, Morning
Conference table designed for 50. Present: 5. Elena, Marcus, two department heads, one security officer. Used to be 30. Now: 5. Reports surreal. Population: 3M (down from 4M). Infrastructure: failing. Crime: up 340%. Births: down 94%. Deaths: up 600% (mostly suicide). Elena taking notes (ritual). Why? No one will read them. Marcus asks: "Orders, Mayor?" "Same as yesterday. Maintain what we can. Document what we can't." "That's all?" "That's everything." After: Marcus stays. "Elena. Why keep doing this?" She considers: "Because someone should bear witness. Someone should say: we tried. We maintained dignity. We cared." "Even though doesn't change anything?" "Especially then." Wei's letters (reads all now). Starting to understand. Governance as presence. Power as witness. Being here as enough.

### David — Solar Array, Noon
Platform 73, 200 meters up. Robot 47B working beside him. Connection housing needs recalibration. Done this repair 127 times in eight years. Will do maybe 1,500 more. Then: vaporized. Work automatic, meditative. 47B chirps status. "Yeah, I see it," David says. When did he start talking to robots? When did robots become better company than humans? Home tonight: see Amara maybe five minutes. "Working late." "Me too." "Okay." When did they stop being married? Thought about jumping (platform edge right there). Thought about it daily for six months. Why doesn't he? No answer. Just: arrays need maintaining. Work needs doing. Why? No reason. But: doing it anyway. Maintenance as something. Better than nothing. Maybe.

### Kenji — Unknown Apartment, Afternoon
Waking up (4 PM). Doesn't know where. Girl sleeping beside him (doesn't remember name). Head throbs. Body aches. One year of this. 365 days parties, substances, forgetting. Lost 15 kilos. Hasn't talked to mother in eight months. Hasn't worked on anything in year. Just: destruction. Checking messages (47 from Mom, reads none). Checking news (more death statistics). Checking himself in mirror (barely recognizes face). This isn't living. This is dying slowly. But: terror still there. Knowing everyone dies. Meaninglessness absolute. So: what else? Finds clothes. Leaves without waking girl. Finds next party. Always another party. Fourteen years left. But who cares?

### Ibrahim — Jerusalem Camp, Evening
One year hollow prayers. One year words without meaning. One year going through motions. Faith: broken completely. But: still in camp (where else?). Kneeling with brothers. They pray with conviction. He mouths words. Feels nothing. Prayer beads in hand: stones. Imam watching (concerned). "Brother Ibrahim, your faith wavers." "My faith is gone." Saying it aloud (first time). Imam's face: grief. "Then what do you fight for?" "I don't know." "Then why are you here?" "I don't know that either." Alone after prayers. One year without faith. Fourteen years ahead without purpose. What now? No answer. Just: emptiness.

### Wei — Lagos Garden, Evening
115 now. Body more frail (needs walker sometimes). Mind still clear. Garden blooming (summer cycle). Sits in evening light, watching flowers. One year since detection. Taught daily: Zara, others who visit, letters to Elena. Her philosophy spreading (seeds taking root). Some people ready to hear. Many not. That's okay. Seeds grow in their own time. Gardenias blooming. Same cycle as always. Bud, bloom, beauty, death. Asteroid doesn't change it. Just makes everyone pay attention. "Fourteen years," she says to flowers. "Quite a lot of time, actually." Body failing (she knows). Maybe ten years left (natural death). Maybe less. That's fine. Ready whenever. Flower will bloom as long as it blooms. Then: complete. Impermanence made visible. This is everything she's taught. Everything she's lived. One year down. As many as remain. All of it: enough.

### Closing (Omniscient)
Seven people. Seven paths. All diverging. Amara: isolated in calculation. Zara: defiant in creation. Elena: maintaining in governance. David: mechanical in maintenance. Kenji: drowning in substance. Ibrahim: hollow in faith-loss. Wei: present in garden. One year gone. Fourteen remain. The fracture complete. Everyone scattered. Everyone coping (or not). Everyone facing the end their own way. Part I complete. The divergence deepens. The isolation grows. Until: it doesn't. Until: reconnection. Until: convergence. But not yet.

**End Part I**
