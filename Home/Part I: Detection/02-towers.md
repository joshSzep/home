# Chapter 2: Towers

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 0, Day 1 | Lagos District**

---

Maya's tower was six blocks tall, wobbling precariously as she reached for the seventh. Her tongue stuck out in concentration—fierce, absolute focus on the task of balancing synthetic wood on synthetic wood. Two years old and already building things. Zara watched from the kitchen table, coffee cooling beside her tablet, engineering schematics for the new water reclamation system glowing in soft blue.

"Mama, look!" Maya held the seventh block triumphantly.

"I see, baby. Very good."

"Higher!"

"Be careful."

The tower swayed but held. Maya giggled—pure delight at her own competence. Zara smiled, the kind of unconscious smile that came from watching her daughter exist. This was the best part of morning: Maya awake but not yet demanding breakfast, Kwame making breakfast in the kitchen, work present but not urgent, the apartment full of morning light and domestic warmth. Lagos District at its best—engineered tropical climate, bright and humid and alive.

Their apartment wasn't large—seventy square meters in a mid-tier building—but it felt spacious. Large windows overlooking the district's green zone. Plants everywhere—Kwame's hobby, his way of bringing nature into manufactured spaces. The air smelled like coffee and soil and something sweet Kwame was cooking.

"Pancakes?" Zara called.

"Synth-banana," Kwame answered from the kitchen. "Maya's favorite."

"My favorite!" Maya agreed, not looking away from her construction project.

Ordinary morning. Beautiful morning. The kind of morning Zara had learned to treasure after Maya's birth—the simple fact of family, together, happy, here. She'd grown up in a scattered family: parents in Mumbai, sister in Antarctica, cousins scattered across three continents. Now she'd built something close and warm. Small family unit. Three people loving each other in seventy square meters. Everything that mattered.

Her tablet chimed. Emergency alert—priority level. Rare. Maybe twice a year, usually infrastructure failures or weather events. She swiped to open it.

Every screen in the apartment lit up simultaneously.

Emergency broadcast override. UN Security Council. The kitchen screen. The living room screen. Her tablet. Kwame's wrist display. Even Maya's toy screen. All showing the same thing: blue emergency banner, UN seal, the face of Secretary General Chen.

"This is not a drill," the Secretary General said. Her face was composed but pale. "A near-Earth object has been detected on collision course with Earth. International verification is complete. Impact probability is ninety-nine point nine seven percent. Time to impact is fifteen years."

Zara's coffee cup was halfway to her lips. It stopped. Hovered. The words were processing through her mind but not connecting to meaning yet. Near-Earth object. Collision course. Fifteen years.

"Multiple deflection scenarios have been analyzed," the Secretary General continued. "All existing deflection technologies are insufficient for an object of this size and velocity. Impact cannot be prevented."

The words clicked into place. Impact. Cannot be prevented. Fifteen years.

Asteroid. Extinction. Everyone dies.

Her engineering mind engaged automatically, calculating before her emotional mind could catch up. Mass required for extinction-level event: ten to fifteen kilometers diameter. Impact energy: hundreds of millions of megatons. Immediate effects: magnitude 10+ earthquake globally, thermal pulse igniting continental wildfires, ejecta blocking sunlight. Secondary effects: nuclear winter, agricultural collapse, ecosystem cascade failure. Timeline to extinction: twelve to eighteen months post-impact.

Fifteen years until impact.

Maya would be seventeen.

The coffee cup slipped from Zara's hand. It hit the table, tipped, spilled. Hot coffee spreading across her engineering schematics. She didn't notice. She was staring at Maya, still placing blocks, still building her tower, still existing in the space before comprehension.

Seventeen years old. Never eighteen. Never an adult. Never falling in love, getting married, having children. Never anything past seventeen. Just: childhood, adolescence, then nothing. Fifteen years of life left.

"The UN Security Council is coordinating with all member nations," the Secretary General said. "Further information will be provided as it becomes available. We ask for calm. We ask for cooperation. We ask—"

Zara wasn't listening anymore. She was looking at her daughter, watching Maya place the eighth block, watching her accomplish something she couldn't have done yesterday. Growing. Learning. Becoming. All of it temporary now. All of it with an expiration date: fifteen years.

"Mama?" Maya looked over, sensing something. "Mama, what's wrong?"

Zara realized she was crying. Tears streaming down her face without sound, without warning. She tried to speak, couldn't. Tried to smile, failed. Maya's face crumpled with confusion and fear.

"Mama!"

Zara crossed the room in three steps, swept Maya up, held her too tight. Maya squirmed: "Mama, too tight!" But Zara couldn't let go, couldn't loosen her grip. She buried her face in Maya's hair, breathing in the smell of her daughter—baby shampoo and morning and life—and sobbed.

"Mama, you're scaring me!" Maya's voice rising toward panic.

Kwame was there suddenly, arms around both of them. His face was stricken, tears on his cheeks. "It's okay, baby," he said to Maya. "Mama's just sad. Everything's okay."

But everything wasn't okay. Everything would never be okay again.

Zara's wrist display chimed. Incoming call: Kwame. She looked up at her husband, confused.

"I called before I left work," Kwame said. "The moment I saw the broadcast. I'm coming home. I'm—" He stopped, realizing. "I'm already here."

"You ran," Zara said.

"Of course I ran."

They held each other, Maya between them, and said nothing. What was there to say? An asteroid was coming. Their daughter would die at seventeen. Physics was absolute. The math was unambiguous. Fifteen years left.

Maya was crying now too, caught in her parents' fear without understanding it. "What's wrong? What happened? Why are you sad?"

How do you explain this to a two-year-old? How do you say: you're going to die young, baby, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. How do you put that into words?

"We love you so much," Zara managed. "So, so much."

"I love you too!" Maya said, confused but reciprocating automatically. "Don't be sad!"

But Zara was sad. Was devastated. Was looking at her daughter and seeing a countdown timer superimposed over her perfect face: fifteen years. 5,478 days. Then: nothing.

The screens were still broadcasting. The Secretary General had been replaced by a panel of scientists explaining the detection, the verification, the impossibility of deflection. Zara heard the words distantly: "Mass one point five times ten to the fifteenth kilograms..." "Trajectory confirmed by seven independent observations..." "No existing technology capable of..."

Her sister would have done this. Amara, the astrophysicist, the expert in Near-Earth Objects. Was she the one who detected it? Who ran the calculations? Who verified that everyone was going to die?

Six months since they'd last talked. An argument about something stupid—Zara couldn't even remember what now. Something about priorities, about family, about Amara missing Maya's first birthday because of work. Zara had sent messages after that: photos of Maya, updates about her development, attempts to bridge the distance. Amara's responses had been brief, distracted. Eventually, Zara stopped trying.

Now she wanted her sister desperately. Wanted to call, to ask questions, to hear Amara explain the math and make it less real. Or more real. Or bearable, somehow. But she didn't know what to say. *My sister calculated my daughter's death.* How do you begin that conversation?

The apartment comm was ringing. Everyone calling everyone. Zara's parents in Mumbai—she could see the queue lighting up. Kwame's mother in what used to be Vancouver. Friends scattered across Lagos District. Everyone reaching out, everyone desperate, everyone needing connection in the face of the incomprehensible.

Zara answered her parents' call. Her mother's face appeared on the screen, already crying. "Zara! Did you see?"

"I saw."

"Maya—" Her mother couldn't finish.

"I know, Mama."

"What do we do?"

"I don't know."

There was nothing to do. That was the terrible truth. No preparations to make. No safety measures to implement. No way to protect Maya from this. Fifteen years from now, the asteroid would hit. The impact would be unsurvivable. That was it. That was everything.

The calls kept coming. Zara answered some, let others go to voicemail. Everyone asking the same questions: Is it real? Are they sure? What do we do? She had no answers. Just: yes, yes, and I don't know.

Maya had calmed down, distracted by Kwame putting on a children's program. But she kept looking at Zara with worried eyes. Children that age didn't understand words, but they understood fear. They understood their parents' emotional state. Maya knew something was terribly wrong, even if she didn't know what.

The morning light streaming through the windows looked the same as it had thirty minutes ago. The plants were still green. The air still smelled like synth-banana pancakes. But everything had changed. The world had ended, quietly, announced by a calm woman in a blue suit reading from a prepared statement.

Fifteen years left.

Zara's mind was already calculating. Maya would be seventeen. Start of her last year in school. Applications for university she'd never attend. Plans for a future that wouldn't exist. Friends she'd grow up with, all dying together. A generation of children born around the same time, all expiring around the same time. Whole world of teenagers facing extinction.

The engineering schematics were ruined—coffee staining the tablet screen brown. The water reclamation system she'd been designing. For what? Why build infrastructure for a civilization that had fifteen years left? Why plan anything?

Her hand went unconsciously to her abdomen. Not pregnant. Not yet. But she and Kwame had been talking about it. Maybe in a year, when Maya was three. Give her a sibling. Build the family larger.

Could they still do that? Should they? Bring a new life into a world with an expiration date?

The thought felt obscene. And necessary. And impossible to resolve.

Kwame saw her gesture, understood. He looked at her with the same question in his eyes.

They didn't talk about it. Not yet. But the question sat between them, heavy and urgent and completely incomprehensible.

The broadcast was showing maps now—impact predictions, destruction radius calculations, survival probability (zero). Zara watched with her engineer's mind, tracking the numbers, understanding the scale. Ten-kilometer asteroid at twenty-eight kilometers per second. Impact energy equivalent to four hundred million megatons. The entire planet's nuclear arsenal was maybe ten thousand megatons. This was forty thousand times larger.

Nothing would survive the initial impact within a thousand kilometers. Nothing would survive the thermal pulse within five thousand. The ash and debris would encircle the planet within weeks. Photosynthesis would cease. The food chain would collapse. Extinction would follow—first the large animals, then the small ones, finally the plants and microorganisms. Maybe some bacteria would survive deep underground, but complex life? Mammals? Humans? Gone.

Twelve to eighteen months after impact, the last humans would die. Starvation, most likely. Or cold. Or violence, in the competition for remaining resources. The end would be slow and terrible and absolute.

And it would arrive in fifteen years.

Maya's tower had fallen over. She was building it again, determined. Zara watched her daughter's small hands positioning blocks with care. This was what humans did. Built things. Even when they fell. Even when they didn't last. Built them anyway.

By evening, the initial shock had worn into numb acceptance. The broadcasts continued—scientists explaining, politicians making statements, religious leaders offering comfort. The networks showed crowds gathering in cities, some panicking, some praying, some just standing together in stunned silence.

Lagos District was quieter than Zara had ever heard it. Usually vibrant, full of sound and movement. Now: muted. Shocked. The streets visible from their window were nearly empty. Everyone inside, everyone processing, everyone trying to understand that the world they knew had just been given an expiration date.

Kwame made dinner. Synth-protein and vegetables. They ate mechanically, not tasting anything. Maya ate with good appetite—she didn't understand, didn't carry the weight they carried. The innocence of two years old.

After Maya was asleep, Zara and Kwame sat on their small balcony. The air was warm and humid, artificial breeze from the climate system. Below, Lagos District stretched in all directions—five million people in this district alone, all living under the same countdown now.

Kwame broke the silence first. "Should we have another child?"

There it was. The question that had been sitting between them all day.

Zara didn't answer immediately. Her mind was calculating again. Pregnant now—baby born in nine months. Fourteen years left. Child would be fourteen when the asteroid hit. Never reach fifteen. Never reach adulthood. Entire childhood in the shadow of extinction.

"That would be cruel," she said finally.

"Would it?"

"Bringing a child into a dying world? Giving them fourteen years, then nothing? How is that not cruel?"

Kwame considered this. He was quiet for a long time, staring out at the dim lights of the district. "What if we're thinking about it wrong?" he said finally. "What if the question isn't about how long, but about what matters? A child born now would have fourteen years of consciousness. Fourteen years of experiencing existence. Being loved. Learning. Growing. Isn't that worth something?"

"Fourteen years."

"Fourteen years is more than infinite non-existence."

Zara's hands were shaking. "I can't think about this right now."

"We have time," Kwame said gently. "Fifteen years, apparently."

It should have been a joke. It wasn't funny. Zara started crying again. Kwame held her. They sat on the balcony in the manufactured warmth and cried for Maya, for themselves, for the future that had just been taken away.

Inside, Maya slept peacefully. Dreaming toddler dreams. Unaware that her entire life had just been given a deadline. Fifteen years to grow up, become a person, exist. Then: physics. Then: nothing.

Later, in bed, Zara pulled up her sister's contact information. Amara's face on the profile photo—serious, competent, distant. Six months of silence. Now: the end of the world.

She started typing a message: *Did you detect it?*

Deleted it.

*Are you okay?*

Deleted it.

*I'm scared.*

Deleted it.

What was there to say to her sister? What words could bridge six months of distance and the detection of an extinction-level asteroid? Amara had probably been the one to first see the data. First to know. First to calculate everyone's death. How do you live with that?

How do you live with any of this?

Zara closed the contact window without sending anything. She'd try again tomorrow. Or the next day. Fifteen years left. Surely they could reconnect. Surely there was time.

Beside her, Kwame was already asleep—or pretending to be. Giving her space to process. He was good at that. Good at being present without demanding anything. Good at loving quietly. Good father. Good husband. Good man who would die in fifteen years along with everyone else.

Maya made a small sound from her room—not distress, just the sounds of sleep. Zara almost went to check on her, then stopped herself. Let her sleep. Let her have one more night of innocence. Tomorrow she'd wake up in a world where everyone knew they were dying. But tonight, she was just two years old, dreaming peacefully, loved and safe and temporary.

Like everything else.

Like everyone else.

Fifteen years.

Zara lay in the dark and tried to imagine it. Maya growing up. Learning to read. Going to school. Making friends. Becoming a teenager. Seventeen years old. Then: nothing. The whole arc of childhood and adolescence, compressed and terminated. Never a full adult. Never independent. Never anything beyond: daughter.

Could Zara do that? Could she parent Maya knowing the ending? Could she have another child, raise them into the apocalypse? Could she keep working, designing water systems for cities that wouldn't last? Could she keep living, day after day, with the countdown running?

She didn't know.

She'd have to find out.

Everyone would.

Outside, Lagos District was dark and quiet. Five million people sleeping, processing, beginning to understand. Five million lives suddenly finite and certain. Fifteen years of tomorrows, then: no more tomorrows.

Zara closed her eyes and tried to sleep.

Couldn't.

Held Kwame closer and tried to feel safe.

Couldn't.

Thought about the child they might have, growing inside her, doomed before birth.

Couldn't stop thinking about it.

Fourteen years.

A whole childhood.

Then nothing.

Was that cruel?

Was that defiant?

Was that meaningless?

Was that everything?

She didn't know yet. But the question sat in her chest, heavy and urgent and impossible to ignore.

Outside, the artificial stars of Lagos District glimmered—millions of lights, millions of lives, all temporary now, all counting down together.

Fifteen years.

Then: physics.

Then: nothing.

Zara fell asleep finally, exhausted, and dreamed of Maya at seventeen, turning to say goodbye.
