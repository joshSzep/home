# Chapter 2: Towers

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 0, Day 1 | Lagos District**

---

Maya's tower was six blocks tall, wobbling precariously as she reached for the seventh. Her tongue stuck out in concentration—fierce, absolute focus on the task of balancing synthetic wood on synthetic wood. Two years old and already building things. Already an engineer.

"Mama, look!" Maya held the seventh block triumphantly.

"I see, baby. Very good." Zara set down her coffee, genuinely impressed. The tower shouldn't be standing. The base was too narrow, the blocks slightly misaligned. But Maya had found the balance point anyway, the way children sometimes stumbled onto solutions that adults would calculate for hours.

"Higher!"

"Be careful."

The tower swayed but held. Maya giggled, and Zara laughed with her—couldn't help it, the sound escaping before she could think about it. This was the best part of morning. The Lagos heat already pressing against the windows, humidity fogging the glass where the climate control fought the outside air. The smell of Kwame's synth-banana pancakes mixing with the coffee she'd let go cold again, with the wet-earth scent of his plants crowding every surface. Their apartment wasn't large—seventy square meters—but it felt full. Full of green things growing, full of Maya's blocks scattered across the floor, full of the sounds of family being family.

"Pancakes ready?" Zara called toward the kitchen.

"Synth-banana." Kwame appeared in the doorway, spatula in hand, wearing the ridiculous apron Maya had picked out for his birthday—bright orange with dancing vegetables. "Maya's favorite."

"My favorite!" Maya agreed, not looking away from her construction project. The eighth block was in her hands now. Ambitious.

Zara watched her daughter's small fingers find the placement, adjust, test. She'd grown up scattered—parents in Mumbai, sister in Antarctica, cousins she'd met maybe twice. Always calling across time zones, never quite connecting. But this, here, this morning—Kwame humming off-key in the kitchen, Maya building impossible towers, the plants pressing green against every window—this was what she'd wanted. What she'd built. Seventy square meters of home.

Her tablet chimed. Emergency alert. She glanced at it, expecting a water main break or power fluctuation—the usual infrastructure complaints she'd get called in to help fix.

Every screen in the apartment lit up simultaneously.

Emergency broadcast override. UN Security Council. The kitchen screen. The living room screen. Her tablet. Kwame's wrist display. Even Maya's toy screen. All showing the same thing: blue emergency banner, UN seal, the face of Secretary General Chen Liwei.

"This is not a drill," Secretary General Chen said. His face was composed but pale—the face of someone who'd been told an hour ago that he had to tell eight billion people they were dying. "A near-Earth object has been detected on collision course with Earth. International verification is complete. Impact probability is ninety-nine point nine seven percent. Time to impact is fifteen years."

Zara's coffee cup was halfway to her lips. It stopped. Hovered. The words were processing through her mind but not connecting to meaning yet. Near-Earth object. Collision course. Fifteen years.

"Multiple deflection scenarios have been analyzed," the Secretary General continued. "All existing deflection technologies are insufficient for an object of this size and velocity. Impact cannot be prevented."

The words clicked into place. Impact. Cannot be prevented. Fifteen years.

Asteroid. Extinction. Everyone dies.

Zara's hands went cold. The coffee cup was still in her grip—she could feel the ceramic, the heat, the weight of it—but her hands had gone cold and distant, like they belonged to someone else. Fifteen years. She knew what that meant. Had designed enough systems, run enough failure analyses, understood enough about planetary-scale catastrophe. The numbers weren't abstract to her. Ten-kilometer diameter meant extinction. Full stop. No engineering solution. No backup system. No redundancy.

Fifteen years until impact.

Maya would be seventeen.

The cup slipped. Zara watched it fall, watched the coffee arc across her tablet, watched the brown stain spread across the water reclamation schematics she'd been designing. Watched it happen and couldn't move to stop it.

Maya was still building. Still reaching for the ninth block. Still existing in the world where towers mattered, where breakfast was coming, where Mama and Papa were right here and everything was fine.

Seventeen. Maya would be seventeen.

Zara was on her feet before she knew she was moving.

"The UN Security Council is coordinating with all member nations," Chen continued, his diplomatic training maintaining his composure. "Further information will be provided as it becomes available. We ask for calm. We ask for cooperation. We ask—"

Zara wasn't listening anymore. She was looking at her daughter, watching Maya place the eighth block, watching her accomplish something she couldn't have done yesterday. Growing. Learning. Becoming. All of it temporary now. All of it with an expiration date: fifteen years.

"Mama?" Maya's voice, small and confused. "Mama, why are you crying?"

Zara hadn't known she was crying until Maya said it. She touched her face—wet, her fingers coming away wet—and then she was across the room, Maya in her arms, holding her too tight. Maya's hair smelled like the lavender shampoo they'd used last night, like sleep, like morning, like everything Zara was going to lose.

"Mama, too tight!"

She couldn't let go. Couldn't make her arms work right. Maya squirming, protesting, not understanding.

Then Kwame's arms were around them both. The apron pressing ridiculous orange against Zara's shoulder. His breath ragged in her ear. He'd seen. He knew.

"It's okay, baby," he told Maya, his voice cracking on the lie. "Mama's just sad. Everything's okay."

Maya's tower had fallen. Zara could see it past Kwame's shoulder—blocks scattered across the floor, the whole structure collapsed. Everything falls. Everything ends. Her daughter would be seventeen years old and then she would be nothing.

"Papa, you're crying too," Maya said, confused and frightened. "Why is everyone crying?"

How do you explain extinction to a two-year-old? You don't. You hold her. You let her feel safe even when nothing is safe. You breathe in the lavender smell of her hair and you stay present because she needs you here, not calculating numbers, not drowning in fear.

"We love you so much," Zara managed. "So, so much."

"I love you too!" Maya said, her small hands patting Zara's wet cheeks. "Don't be sad, Mama. I build you a new tower."

Zara almost laughed. Almost broke completely. Maya, offering to fix it. Offering to build something. Two years old and already responding to catastrophe the way engineers did—by making something.

"Okay, baby," Zara whispered. "You build me a new tower."

The screens were still broadcasting—scientists now, explaining what the Secretary General had announced. Zara let the words wash past. She didn't need experts to explain impact physics. She'd taken the same courses Amara had, back before their paths diverged. Amara to space, Zara to water. Amara to watching the sky, Zara to building systems that kept people alive.

Amara. Her sister. The astrophysicist. The one who tracked exactly these kinds of objects.

Was Amara the one who found it?

Six months since they'd last talked. An argument about something stupid—Zara couldn't even remember what now. Something about priorities, about family, about Amara missing Maya's first birthday because of work. Zara had sent messages after that: photos of Maya, updates about her development, attempts to bridge the distance. Amara's responses had been brief, distracted. Eventually, Zara stopped trying.

Now she wanted her sister desperately. Wanted to call, to ask questions, to hear Amara explain the math and make it less real. Or more real. Or bearable, somehow. But she didn't know what to say. *My sister calculated my daughter's death.* How do you begin that conversation?

The apartment comm was ringing. Everyone calling everyone. Zara's parents in Mumbai—she could see the queue lighting up. Kwame's mother in what used to be Vancouver. Friends scattered across Lagos District. Everyone reaching out, everyone desperate, everyone needing connection in the face of the incomprehensible.

Zara answered her parents' call. Her mother's face appeared on the screen, already crying. "Zara! Did you see?"

"I saw."

"Maya—" Her mother couldn't finish.

"I know, Mama."

"What do we do?"

"I don't know."

There was nothing to do. That was the terrible truth. No preparations to make. No safety measures to implement. No way to protect Maya from this. Fifteen years from now, the asteroid would hit. The impact would be unsurvivable. That was it. That was everything.

The calls kept coming. Zara answered some, let others go to voicemail. Everyone asking the same questions: Is it real? Are they sure? What do we do? She had no answers. Just: yes, yes, and I don't know.

Maya had calmed down, distracted by Kwame putting on a children's program. But she kept looking at Zara with worried eyes. Children that age didn't understand words, but they understood fear. They understood their parents' emotional state. Maya knew something was terribly wrong, even if she didn't know what.

Maya was already back on the floor, gathering blocks. Building again. The morning light still came through the windows. The plants still pressed green against the glass. Kwame's pancakes were burning—Zara could smell it, the synthetic banana going acrid—but neither of them moved to save them.

The broadcast continued. Maps now. Impact projections. Casualty estimates.

Zara looked at her tablet, still wet with coffee. The water reclamation system she'd been designing. Forty thousand liters per day. Six months of work. For what? For a city that wouldn't exist in fifteen years?

She should feel something about that. The waste of it. But all she could feel was Maya on the floor, small hands stacking blocks, determined to build something that would stand.

Her hand found her abdomen without her deciding to move it. Flat. Empty. They'd been talking about trying again. Maybe next year, when Maya was three. Give her a sibling.

Kwame saw the gesture. His eyes met hers across Maya's head.

Neither of them spoke. But the question was there between them, heavy as the humid Lagos air pressing against the windows.

The broadcast kept going. Maps, numbers, physics. Zara had stopped listening. She knew enough. Knew too much, probably—the engineering courses, the disaster modeling, the systems thinking that made her good at her job and terrible at denial.

Maya's tower fell again. Blocks scattering across the floor with soft plastic sounds.

"Oh no," Maya said. And then, immediately: "I fix it."

She gathered the blocks. Started again. Tower number three, or four, or five—Zara had lost count. But Maya hadn't. Maya just kept building.

Zara watched her daughter's small hands find the balance points, test the weight, adjust. This was what humans did. Built things. Even when they fell. Even when they couldn't last. Built them anyway.

She was crying again. Couldn't stop. Didn't try.

By evening, the initial shock had worn into something quieter. Not acceptance—nothing so complete. Just: the body could only sustain that level of fear for so long.

The broadcasts continued. Scientists, politicians, religious leaders. Zara had stopped watching hours ago.

Outside, Lagos was stirring again. She could hear it through the walls—voices from neighboring apartments, someone's music playing three floors down, the distant hum of transport moving through the district. The silence of the morning had been unnatural. This was more like Lagos: sound, movement, life insisting on itself even when everything had changed.

Kwame made dinner. The smell of cooking filled the apartment—synth-protein and the snap of vegetables hitting hot oil. Normal smells. Ordinary evening sounds. Maya sat in her high chair, eating with good appetite, kicking her feet against the footrest in some private rhythm. She didn't know. Couldn't know. Was just hungry, just eating, just being two years old.

Zara forced herself to eat. Couldn't taste anything.

After Maya was asleep, they sat on the small balcony. The Lagos night pressed warm and close—humidity like a second skin, the artificial breeze doing little against it. Zara had pulled her hair up off her neck but could still feel sweat gathering at her temples. Below them, the district spread in all directions. Lights coming on. People moving. Five million lives in this district alone.

Kwame's voice came soft in the darkness. "Should we have another child?"

Zara's stomach clenched. There it was. The question she'd been circling all day.

"I don't know," she said. Honest. Raw.

"Me neither." He was quiet for a moment. "But I keep thinking—fourteen years. That's a childhood. A whole childhood."

"But never adult," Zara said. "Never independent. Never—"

"Never a lot of things." Kwame turned to look at her. His face was hard to read in the dim light, but she could hear the weight in his voice. "But fourteen years of being loved. Fourteen years of existing. Fourteen years of—" He stopped. Swallowed. "Of being part of this family. Isn't that worth something?"

Zara's hands were shaking. She pressed them flat against her thighs. "I don't know. I can't—I can't think about it. Not yet."

He reached for her hand. Found it. Held on.

They sat like that for a long time, watching the lights of Lagos blink and shift below them. Inside, Maya slept. Dreaming whatever two-year-olds dream. Innocent of everything except being loved.

Later, in bed, Zara held her phone in the dark. Amara's contact glowed on the screen—that old photo, her sister looking serious and competent and far away. Six months since they'd talked. Some stupid argument Zara couldn't even remember now.

She started typing: *Did you find it? Was it you?*

Deleted it. Started again: *I'm scared and I don't know what to do and I need my sister.*

Stared at the words. Deleted them. Put the phone down.

Tomorrow. She'd try tomorrow. There was time. Wasn't there? Fifteen years of time.

Beside her, Kwame's breathing had gone slow and even. Sleep or good imitation. She curled against his back, pressed her face between his shoulder blades. Warm. Solid. Here.

From the next room, she could hear Maya breathing. Soft, regular sounds. The rhythm of uncomplicated sleep.

Fifteen years. Maya would be seventeen. Would never be eighteen.

Zara lay in the dark and listened to her daughter breathe, and tried not to count.

She slept eventually, exhausted past thinking.

And dreamed of Maya at seventeen, turning around to smile at her, the light behind her too bright to look at.
