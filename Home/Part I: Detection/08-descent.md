# Chapter 8: Descent

**Kenji Torres | Year 0, Days 60-75 | Lagos District**

---

The apartment wasn't his. Kenji couldn't remember whose it was. Someone he'd met at the last party, or the party before that. Days blurred together now. Parties, substances, bodies, noise. One long spiral of forgetting.

The music was too loud. Lagos-Antarctic fusion—traditional drums mixed with synth bass, vocals processed through effects that made human voices sound alien. The beat pounded through the floor, through Kenji's chest, through his skull. Perfect. Loud enough to drown thought. Loud enough to make feeling impossible.

How many people were here? Fifty? A hundred? Hard to tell in the strobing lights. Bodies everywhere—dancing, coupling, collapsing. Most were young, twenties and early thirties. Everyone desperate. Everyone trying to feel something other than the knowledge that they were dying.

Day 72 since detection. Kenji had counted at first. Now he had to check his wrist display to know. Seventy-two days. Tenth week. Two and a half months. Fourteen years, nine months remaining.

He'd been to thirty-seven parties. Or forty. He'd lost count. Started Day 3—one night of escape. Then Day 5. Then Day 7. By Day 20, daily. By Day 40, he stopped going home between them. Just: party to party, apartment to apartment, stranger to stranger. Always moving. Never still. Stillness meant thinking.

"You're Kenji Torres?" A girl approached. Maybe twenty-two. Glassy eyes, pupils wide. On something. Like everyone else. Like him.

"Yeah."

"Elena Torres's son? The mayor?"

"Yeah."

"Must be weird." She swayed to the music, movements loose and uncoordinated. "Your mom running a dying city."

Kenji took a drink from whatever was in his hand. Didn't taste it. "Must be weird being anyone right now."

She laughed—too loud, too long. Everything exaggerated. "True! Hey, want something?" She held out her palm. Three pills. Blue, unmarked. "Makes you forget for a while."

"How long?"

"Six hours, maybe. Or six minutes. Time gets weird."

Kenji took two. Swallowed them dry. The girl took the third. They stood in the pounding music, waiting for the chemicals to work.

"What did you do?" she asked. "Before?"

"PhD candidate. Asteroid deflection."

Another laugh. "That's so fucked! You studied how to stop them and couldn't?"

"Yeah." His voice was flat. "That's so fucked."

The pills started working. Reality softened. Edges blurred. The music became texture instead of sound—physical presence wrapping around him. His body felt distant, like he was operating it remotely. Perfect. This was perfect. Consciousness without presence. Sensation without meaning.

The girl was dancing. Or falling. Hard to tell. Kenji watched her move, feeling nothing. The room pulsed with bodies and light. Everyone seeking the same thing: oblivion. Temporary death before real death. Practice dying. He was good at it now.

Time fractured. He was dancing. He was sitting. He was in a different room. Someone's bedroom, three people he didn't know, sharing substances he didn't ask about. The conversation was about nothing. Everything. The asteroid. Their ex-lovers. Whether anything mattered. The usual desperate philosophy of the doomed.

"If we all die," someone said—man, maybe thirty, face blurred by the drugs, "then nothing we did mattered. Right? Our relationships, our work, our... everything. Gone. Erased."

"So do whatever," someone else responded. "No consequences. Eat, fuck, sleep, die. That's all that's left."

"That's depressing."

"That's freedom."

Kenji listened without engaging. He'd had this conversation twenty times. Thirty times. It never resolved. Just: circular logic spinning in drug-addled minds. Meaning versus meaninglessness. Freedom versus futility. Philosophy without foundation.

He stood. Needed to move. Left the room without saying goodbye. No one noticed. Or cared. Or remembered who he was. All the same in the spiral.

Back in the main room, the party continued. The music had changed—slower now, dreamier, vocals floating over ambient synth. People moving like they were underwater. Kenji moved with them, his body following rhythms his mind couldn't process. Good. Thought was the enemy. Sensation was all.

A hand on his arm. He turned. Different girl. Or the same girl? Hard to tell. Faces blurred.

"You look lost," she said.

"I am."

"Want to be lost together?"

They were kissing. Or had been kissing. Time jumped. Now they were in another room, on someone's bed, clothes complicated and in the way. Kenji's hands moved automatically. His body knew what to do even when his mind was elsewhere. Muscle memory of connection without actual connection.

Afterward, the girl—he never learned her name—fell asleep. Kenji lay beside her, staring at the ceiling, feeling the drugs wearing off. The crash always came. High to baseline to below. The payment for forgetting.

The room was too quiet. He could think again. That was bad. Thinking meant remembering: dissertation abandoned, future lost, mother worried, brilliance wasted. Thinking meant feeling: guilt for the spiral, shame for the waste, fear of the asteroid, horror at meaninglessness.

He needed more. More substances. More noise. More people. More anything that stopped the thinking.

He left without waking her. Back to the party. But the party was different now—morning light creeping through windows, many people gone, the ones remaining sprawled on furniture or floor. The aftermath. The waste. The evidence of collective desperation made visible in daylight.

Kenji found more pills. Took them. Chased them with something alcoholic. Sat on a couch beside two people who might have been unconscious or sleeping or dead. Hard to tell. Didn't check. Didn't care. Just: sat and waited for the chemicals to work again.

His wrist display chimed. Message from Elena. Tenth message this week. He read it: "Mijo, please come home. Or just call. Let me know you're alive. I love you."

He almost responded. Almost typed: "I'm alive. Barely. Slowly dying like everyone else. Just faster." Almost sent it. Instead: deleted. Put the device on silent. Returned to the soft chemicals dissolving reality.

Someone sat beside him. Male, older, maybe forty. Clear-eyed. Not on anything, apparently. Unusual.

"You okay?" the man asked.

Kenji laughed. "No one's okay."

"Fair. You look particularly not-okay though."

"I'm fine."

"You're dying on my couch."

Kenji focused on the man. "Your couch?"

"My apartment. My party. Well, was my party. Now it's just wreckage."

"Sorry."

"Don't be. Everyone's wrecked." The man studied him. "How long you been doing this?"

"Doing what?"

"The parties. The substances. The running."

Kenji calculated. "Ten weeks. Since detection."

"How's that working?"

"Terribly."

"But you keep doing it."

"What else is there?"

The man stood. "Come on. Food. Water. You look like you haven't eaten in days."

"I'm fine."

"You're not. Come on."

Something in the man's voice—not command, just certainty—made Kenji follow. They went to the kitchen, separated from the party wreckage by a wall. The man made eggs, real protein, expensive. Toast. Coffee. Set it in front of Kenji.

"Eat."

Kenji ate mechanically. Couldn't remember last time he'd had real food. Nutrient bars, maybe. Days ago. The food tasted like nothing. His taste buds were burned out. But his body needed it. He ate without pleasure.

"I'm Michael," the man said.

"Kenji."

"I know. You're Elena Torres's son. PhD candidate. Brilliant, they say."

"Was brilliant. Past tense."

"What happened?"

"Asteroid happened." Kenji finished the eggs. "My dissertation was on deflection scenarios. Theoretical exercises for stopping Near-Earth Objects. Then a real one showed up. Too big, too fast, too close. Every scenario I studied: failure. My whole field: useless. Turns out studying how to save humanity doesn't matter when humanity can't be saved."

Michael poured more coffee. "So you stopped."

"So I stopped. Closed the dissertation. Never opened it again. What's the point?"

"What's the point of anything?"

"Exactly." Kenji drank the coffee. Bitter. Good. Sensation breaking through the numbness. "Everything's pointless. Might as well party until it's over."

"That working?" Michael asked again.

"No. But nothing else would either."

"You sure?"

Kenji stared at him. Clear-eyed. Sober. Present. How? "How are you not... like this?" He gestured at himself. "How are you not drowning?"

"Who says I'm not? I just drown differently." Michael leaned against the counter. "I'm a builder. Was a builder. Infrastructure. Transit systems. Spent twenty years designing things that last centuries. Now? Everything ends in fourteen years. My life's work: erased."

"So why aren't you partying?"

"I did. First three weeks. Exactly like you. Substances, noise, forgetting. Then I woke up in a stranger's apartment and realized: I'd spent three weeks dying faster instead of living better. The asteroid takes fourteen years. I was taking them faster myself."

"What changed?"

"I went back to work."

Kenji laughed. "Work? What's the point of work?"

"Same point as partying. Fills time. But work leaves something. Partying leaves hangover."

"Work leaves nothing. The asteroid erases everything."

"So? Does everything need to last to matter?"

The question sat between them. Kenji's drug-addled mind tried to process it. Does everything need to last to matter? His dissertation hadn't lasted—abandoned after four years. Did those four years not matter? His relationship with his mother—that would end in fourteen years. Did that mean it was meaningless now?

"I don't know," Kenji admitted.

"Me neither. But I'm back at work anyway. Building transit systems that'll operate for fourteen years, then: physics. But those fourteen years matter to the people using them. And the work matters to me. Not because it's permanent. Because it's what I do."

Kenji felt something shifting. Not dramatic. Just: small crack in the certainty that everything was meaningless. If work mattered despite ending... if building mattered despite eventual destruction... then maybe...

"You should go home," Michael said gently. "Your mother's worried. Can see it in the news reports. Mayor Elena Torres, governing brilliantly, dying inside because her son's destroying himself."

"She called you?"

"No. I just watch the broadcasts. And I recognize grief." Michael cleared the dishes. "You don't have to stop partying. You don't have to be okay. But maybe go home. Let your mom see you're alive. That's not nothing."

Kenji sat in the kitchen of a stranger's apartment, coming down from substances he didn't remember taking, and felt: exhausted. Completely, utterly exhausted. Ten weeks of running. Ten weeks of forgetting. Ten weeks of slowly dying.

And he was still here. Still alive. Still carrying the weight. The running hadn't helped. The substances hadn't helped. The spiral was just spiral—going nowhere, accomplishing nothing, just: falling.

"I don't know how to stop," Kenji said quietly.

"You just stop. Or you don't. But maybe stop today. See how it feels. Tomorrow, choose again."

Today. Tomorrow. String of choices. Not fourteen years of choices—too overwhelming. Just: today's choice. Could he stop today? Could he go home, face his mother, try to be present instead of obliterated?

Maybe.

He stood. Unsteady but functional. "Thanks for the food."

"You're welcome. Come back if you need. Or don't. But take care of yourself. As much as anyone can."

Kenji left the apartment. The hallway was bright with morning light. Lagos District waking up—people heading to work, to errands, to normal activities like normal people. Kenji felt alien among them. Hollowed out. Wasted.

But: moving toward home instead of toward the next party. Small change. Barely noticeable. Maybe meaningless.

Maybe not.

The transit system took him across districts. Lagos to Antarctic Central Hub, thirty minutes. Kenji watched the megacity pass—billions of lives, all temporary, all doomed. But all living anyway. Working. Building. Continuing. Like Michael said: filling time with something other than destruction.

Could Kenji do that? Could he work again? Study again? Be human again? The dissertation was gone. That future was dead. But... fourteen years remained. That was time. What could he fill it with?

He didn't know yet. But for the first time in ten weeks, the question felt answerable. Not answered. Just: answerable. Possible. Someday.

Not today. Today, he'd go home. Sleep. Eat. See his mother. Small steps. Practice being alive instead of practicing dying.

Tomorrow: choose again. String of tomorrows. Maybe some of them would include work. Maybe some would include meaning. Maybe some would be present instead of obliterated.

Or maybe he'd spiral again. Maybe the parties would reclaim him. Maybe the substances would win. But: today, he was going home.

Today, that was enough.

The transit stopped at Antarctic Central. Kenji disembarked. His mother's building was ten blocks. He walked slowly, exhausted, barely present. Counted the blocks. Focused on the counting. One step. Another step. Movement forward. Small. Barely.

But forward.

He reached her building. Took the elevator. Stood outside her door. His finger hovered over the call button.

What would he say? "Sorry I'm a mess"? "Sorry I've been dying"? "Sorry I can't handle the truth"?

He pressed the button.

Elena answered immediately. Robe on, like she'd just woken. Saw his face. Her expression: relief, fear, love, pain. Everything at once.

"Mijo," she said. Voice breaking. "Come in."

He came in.

She held him. He fell apart. Sobbed like he hadn't in ten weeks. All the grief, the fear, the meaninglessness pouring out. She held him. Didn't fix it. Didn't try. Just: held.

They sat on her couch. She made tea—the ritual of crisis. He drank it. Bitter. Real. Present.

"I don't know how to do this," he said. "I don't know how to live fourteen years knowing they end."

"Me neither," Elena admitted. "But we try anyway."

"What if trying doesn't help?"

"Then we fail together."

Kenji leaned against his mother. Exhausted. Broken. Still lost. But: home. Not running. Not hiding. Just: here.

Ten weeks of spiral. Today: pause. Tomorrow: unknown. Fourteen years: unfathomable. But today—today he was with his mother, drinking tea, being witnessed.

It wasn't enough. Didn't fix anything. Didn't make meaninglessness meaningful.

But it was something. Small something. Fragile something. Present something.

The spiral might reclaim him tomorrow. Probably would. The parties were easier than presence. Substances were easier than feeling. Running was easier than being.

But today, he'd stopped running. Sat still. Let his mother hold him. Existed in the moment without obliteration.

Small step. Barely noticeable. Maybe temporary.

Maybe beginning.

Time would tell. Fourteen years would tell. Or tomorrow would tell. Or the next party would tell.

But today, Kenji Torres was home.

And that was different than yesterday.

And different was something.

Small something.

Enough for today.
