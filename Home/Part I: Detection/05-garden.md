# Chapter 5: Garden

**Professor Mei-Lin Wei | Year 0, Day 1 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia bloomed despite the season. Late autumn, and here was this rebellious flower opening its white petals to the manufactured warmth of Lagos District. Professor Mei-Lin Wei touched the bloom gently—soft as paper, fragrant as memory. Her grandmother Jiayi had grown gardenias in the courtyard of their Beijing home, seventy years ago. Wei remembered sitting on the stone bench at five years old, watching her grandmother's weathered hands move among the blooms. Different flowers now, same scent. Everything changed. Everything stayed the same.

Wei's balcony garden was modest—ten square meters of carefully tended life. Native flowers adapted to the engineered tropical climate. Vegetables in raised beds that saved her knees. A small lemon tree she'd transported from Beijing ten years ago when she'd finally retired and moved here to be near her only remaining student who'd become something like family. Everything impermanent. Everything returning to soil eventually.

She was 114 years old. Her left knee reminded her of this with every step. Her right hip joined the complaint on stairs. Her hands shook enough that watering required both attention and a lighter can than she'd used a decade ago. She moved carefully, cane in left hand, water in right. Life extension medicine had added thirty years to human lifespans, but it hadn't made those years comfortable. Her doctors said she might reach 125. Wei suspected they were being optimistic to avoid upsetting the elderly, which she found both patronizing and amusing.

But her mind remained sharp. That's what mattered. Seventy years teaching philosophy. Forty years practicing Buddhist meditation—not religious Buddhism with rebirth and deities, but philosophical Buddhism, the observation of impermanence and suffering and the nature of consciousness. Lifetime spent preparing for death. Not fearfully. Curiously. Death was the one certainty. Everything else was speculation.

The watering complete, Wei lowered herself carefully onto her garden bench. The morning was bright and warm. Lagos District waking up below—five million people beginning another day. She could see the district's green zone from here, the engineered parks and waterways that made this manufactured city feel alive. Humans were good at making homes. Even in deserts, even at poles, even after climate catastrophe forced migrations. The adaptability was admirable. The attachment to permanence was the problem.

Her house system chimed. Emergency alert. The whole building lighting up. Wei set down the watering can carefully. Stood slowly. Walked inside, where her screen was displaying the blue banner of UN Security Council override.

She read the alert. Extinction-level asteroid. Fifteen years. Cannot be deflected.

Read it twice, making sure she understood. The English was clear. The meaning unambiguous. Near-Earth object, ten to fifteen kilometers diameter, 99.97% impact probability. Time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. All deflection scenarios insufficient.

Everyone dies.

Wei noticed she had overfilled the watering can. Water was pooling around her feet, soaking into her house slippers. She looked down at the puddle, then back at the screen, then back at her wet feet.

"Hm," she said aloud. The first sound she'd made since waking.

She turned off the screen. Went to get a towel. Dried her feet. Found her outdoor sandals. Then returned to her garden, picked up the watering can—more carefully this time—and continued her morning routine.

This was philosophy made concrete. The asteroid didn't change the present moment. It didn't change what needed doing. The gardenias were thirsty. She would water them. That's what presence meant—attending to what was here, now, regardless of what was coming.

She'd been practicing this for forty years. Now it was test.

The lemon tree needed water too. She watered it carefully, making sure the soil absorbed rather than ran off. Fifty years old, this tree. Her husband Li Chen had planted the seed the year they married. He'd died at sixty-three—heart failure, sudden and complete. The tree had survived him by thirty years. It would not survive this.

Wei had outlived two husbands, three siblings, and countless students. She'd grown accustomed to surviving. Now she would not survive either. In a strange way, that was a relief. She was tired of attending funerals.

But today, the tree needed water. So she watered it.

Movement at her door. Wei turned, saw Zara bursting onto the balcony. Zara Okafor-Mensah, her neighbor and friend—still in sleep clothes, hair uncombed, Maya on her hip. Both crying. Zara's bare feet slapping the tile.

"Professor Wei!" Zara's voice was rising toward hysteria. "An asteroid! Fifteen years! Everyone dies!"

Wei set down the watering can. "Yes," she said. "I saw. Sit."

"Did you hear? An asteroid! It's going to hit!" Zara wasn't sitting, was pacing, agitated. Maya crying harder, scared by her mother's fear. "My daughter will die! She's two! She'll be seventeen! Never eighteen, never—" Her voice broke. She collapsed onto the bench, sobbing. Maya sobbing too, not understanding but caught in the grief.

Wei sat beside them. Didn't touch yet. Just: present. Grief needed space to move before wisdom could enter. She'd learned this teaching philosophy students for seventy years. You couldn't rush past emotion to understanding. The emotion had to be felt first.

Zara cried for several minutes. Maya gradually calming, thumb in mouth, leaning against her mother. Wei sat patiently. The garden was quiet except for the sounds of grief. The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree stood still. Everything continuing despite the sorrow.

Eventually, Zara's sobs quieted. She wiped her face roughly. "How are you so calm? Did you not hear? Everyone dies!"

"I heard," Wei said gently.

"Then how are you sitting here watering plants?"

"The plants are thirsty. Should I let them die today because they'll die in fifteen years?"

Zara stared at her. "That's not the same thing."

"Isn't it? The plants were always going to die. This season, next season, the season after. Impermanence was always there. The asteroid just makes the timeline visible."

"My daughter!" Zara's voice rose again. "She's two! She'll be seventeen! She'll never grow up, never—"

"Was she not always going to die?" Wei asked quietly.

The question stopped Zara mid-sentence. "What?"

"Was Maya not always temporary? Was her life not always going to end?" Wei gestured to the gardenias. "This flower bloomed yesterday. Tomorrow, it will start browning. Three days from now, fallen. Two weeks from now, just memory. Same cycle every year. Every gardenia blooms and dies. The asteroid doesn't change the flower's nature. Just makes us pay attention."

"You're comparing my daughter to a flower?"

"I'm comparing all of us to flowers. Temporary. Beautiful. Here for brief moment, then gone. That was always true. Most people pretend otherwise. The asteroid ends the pretending."

Zara was quiet, processing. Maya had stopped crying, was looking at the gardenias with interest. Wei pointed to the white bloom. "See the flower, Maya?"

Maya nodded, thumb still in mouth.

"Beautiful, yes?"

Another nod.

"Tomorrow, less beautiful. Day after, falling. But today—" Wei touched the bloom gently. "Today, perfect. That's all flowers get. Today. Right now. This moment of blooming."

"She's two," Zara whispered. "She doesn't understand."

"She understands more than you think. Children are closer to the truth. They live in the moment naturally. We teach them to plan, to project, to imagine permanence. But originally, they knew. This moment. This moment. This moment. That's all anyone has ever had."

Zara was crying again, but quieter. Not hysteria now. Just: grief. "Fifteen years. It's not enough."

"No," Wei agreed. "It's not. But was seventy years enough? Eighty? A hundred? I'm 114. Is that enough? Would 125 be? Would a thousand?" She was quiet for a moment. "Nothing is ever enough if we think it should be permanent. But if we accept impermanence—really accept it—then every moment becomes enough. Not in the sense of satisfying. In the sense of complete."

"I can't—" Zara shook her head. "I can't think that way."

"No one can, immediately. It's practice. Daily practice for years. I've been preparing for death my entire adult life. This news is shocking. But the truth it reveals? That was always there."

Maya squirmed down from Zara's lap, toddled over to the gardenias. Reached out with small fingers. "Pretty!"

"Gentle," Zara said automatically. Maya touched the bloom carefully, delicately—her whole attention on the flower, nothing else existing for her in that moment. Wei watched the two-year-old examine the petals with complete focus. No worry about tomorrow. No memory of yesterday. Just: here, now, this flower.

That was presence. That was what adults spent decades trying to relearn. Children had it naturally. Then life taught them to live elsewhere—in fear, in planning, in anywhere but here. Maya would lose this too, eventually. But maybe, if Zara brought her here often enough, some of it would stay.

"Come to my garden every day," Wei said to Zara. "Bring Maya. Watch the flowers bloom and die. Watch the lemon tree fruit and rest. Practice seeing impermanence. Practice being present anyway. Won't make the asteroid disappear. But might make fifteen years richer than most people's eighty."

"Will you teach me?" Zara's voice was small, hopeful.

"I will teach you nothing," Wei said. "But I will sit with you while you learn. Possibly I will make tea. Definitely I will complain about my knees."

Zara managed a weak smile. "Is that Buddhist philosophy?"

"That's gardening philosophy. Same thing, really. Buddhists just wrote more books about it." Wei stood slowly, using the bench arm for leverage, feeling every year of the 114 in her hip joint. "Go home. Hold your daughter. Make breakfast. Do the things that need doing today. Tomorrow, come back. Every day. We'll sit together. Watch life being temporary. That's the practice."

"What if I can't do it? What if I panic?"

"Then panic. Then come to the garden anyway. Panic and practice aren't opposites. Panic is feeling. Practice is action. Do both."

Zara collected Maya, who protested leaving the flowers. "Tomorrow, baby. We'll come back tomorrow."

"Garden!" Maya demanded.

"Yes, the garden. Professor Wei's garden."

They left. Wei sat on her bench, listening to their footsteps fade. The balcony was quiet again. The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree—Li Chen's tree—stood patient.

Fifteen years. She considered the number. Her father had died at forty-seven, caught in the upheavals before the Climate Compact. Her mother at fifty-two, grief-broken. Her first husband drowned at thirty-one; her second, Li Chen, heart-stopped at sixty-three. So many students over the decades, lost to accidents and illnesses and the quiet despair that took people when they stopped seeing reasons to stay.

Fifteen years was more than many people got. Not that comparison made sense. But Wei had been alive long enough to know that fairness was a human invention. The universe didn't traffic in fairness. It trafficked in physics. And the physics was clear.

Her body would probably fail before the asteroid arrived. She was 114. Cancer, stroke, simple organ failure—any of them could take her first. She'd been preparing for death for forty years. Now death had a deadline. That was almost helpful. Clarity, at least.

For Zara, for Maya, for the young ones—this was tragedy. All cut off mid-life. All denied the full span.

Was that worse than dying at eighty? Wei had asked this question for forty years of teaching. Never found an answer. But she'd found something else: the question was less important than how you spent your time while asking it.

The morning was advancing. Lagos District fully awake now. Wei could hear agitation in the distance—voices raised, sirens, the sound of disruption. People reacting. People panicking. People trying to process the unprocessable. All of it normal. All of it necessary. The grief would move through at its own pace.

She returned to her watering. A few plants still dry. Her body protested the movement, but she ignored it. Body always protested. That's what 114 years meant. But the work remained. The plants needed tending. That was enough.

When the watering was complete, she sat again. Pulled out her writing materials—old-fashioned paper and pen, not screens. Her eyes were too old for screens. She'd been writing a book for twenty years. Reflections on philosophy, practice, teaching. Never finished it. Might never finish it.

But now, with fifteen years defined—well. Perhaps the deadline would help. She'd always worked better with deadlines. Seventy years of academic life had trained her for that.

Asteroid as writing deadline. Her husband would have found that funny. Li Chen had always said she needed external pressure to finish anything.

"You were right," she said aloud to the lemon tree. The tree didn't answer. It rarely did.

She wrote for an hour. About impermanence. About presence. About her grandmother Jiayi's hands among the gardenias, seventy years ago. The words came easily. Seventy years of teaching had clarified what she knew. And more importantly, what she didn't know.

By noon, she was tired. Her hand cramped around the pen. Her back ached from sitting. 114 years old, and every year made itself felt.

She put away the writing. Made tea—oolong, the good kind she saved for difficult days. Sat in her garden with the cup warm in shaking hands.

The gardenias bloomed. Li Chen's lemon tree stood patient. The sun moved across the sky. Everything temporary. Everything continuing anyway.

Fifteen years until extinction.

But right now, the tea was good, and the flowers were beautiful.

Wei sipped, and watched, and was present.

That was all there was to do. That was everything.
