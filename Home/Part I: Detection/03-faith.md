# Chapter 3: Faith

**Ibrahim al-Rashid | Year 0, Day 1 | Jerusalem**

---

*Allahu Akbar.*

The words were automatic. Ibrahim had spoken them five times daily since he was old enough to speak. God is greatest. The foundation of everything. The opening of every prayer, every call, every moment of submission to Allah's will.

His forehead touched the prayer mat—rough wool, worn soft by three years of use. Around him, his brothers knelt in rows. Forty fighters facing Mecca, moving in perfect synchronization. Backs straight, then bowing. Foreheads to earth, then rising. The choreography of submission performed together, as it had been performed for fourteen centuries.

*Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim.*

In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.

The evening prayer was Ibrahim's favorite. Maghrib—sunset prayer, when the day's fighting paused and peace descended over their camp in the Jerusalem hills. The light slanting golden through the tent fabric. The cooling air after desert heat. The collective presence of his brothers, all aligned toward the same point, all surrendered to the same God.

This was certainty. This was purpose. This was home.

But more than that—and Ibrahim had never told anyone this, would never find words adequate—this was when he *felt* God. Not intellectually understood. Not dutifully believed. *Felt*. The presence arriving like warmth spreading through his chest. The sense of being held, witnessed, loved by something infinitely greater. His brothers around him, moving together, breathing together, prostrating together—and in that synchronized surrender, something opened. A door in his heart that led somewhere vast and luminous and absolutely real.

He'd felt it first at age twelve. Friday prayers at the mosque in his village. The imam's voice calling them to worship. Two hundred men rising, bowing, prostrating in perfect unison. Ibrahim among them, going through motions he'd practiced since childhood. Then: it happened. Like the room filled with light, though his eyes were closed. Like he could feel every person there—their hearts, their prayers, their presence. Like God was so close Ibrahim could almost touch Him. So present that tears ran down his face onto the prayer mat.

He'd asked his father about it afterward. "Baba, did you feel that? In the prayer? Did you feel... something?"

His father had smiled. "Yes, son. That's Allah. That's why we pray. Not just the words—the presence. You felt Him. Be grateful. Some people pray their whole lives and never feel what you just felt."

After that, Ibrahim chased it. Not every prayer brought the feeling. Sometimes it was just rote motion, just words said because they were supposed to be said. But often enough—especially at maghrib, especially with his brothers, especially when the light was right and the air was cool and everyone was aligned—the door opened. God arrived. The presence filled him. And Ibrahim knew, with every cell of his being, that this was real. That Allah saw him. That paradise waited. That dying in service to this was the greatest honor imaginable.

That's what made him a fighter. Not ideology. Not politics. Not even justice. The feeling. The certainty that came from direct encounter. He'd met God. How could he not defend the land where God dwelled? How could he not fight for the holy places where that presence was strongest? How could death be frightening when it meant returning to the source of that light he felt in prayer?

Ibrahim was nineteen years old. He'd joined the militia at sixteen, the moment he was old enough. Before that: madrasah, studying Quran, learning from the imam. His whole life had been preparation for this—defending the holy land, serving Allah, earning paradise through righteous struggle.

Jerusalem had been contested for three millennia. Muslim, Christian, Jew—all claiming the same stones, the same streets, the same sacred spaces. In the era of Forever Earth, when humanity abandoned the stars and accepted planetary confinement, Jerusalem became more precious. Not just spiritually sacred, but eternally so. The conflicts weren't going to end. There would be no exodus to new worlds. This was it. This land. Forever.

So they fought. And Ibrahim believed—totally, completely—that this fight was righteous. That Allah guided their hands. That martyrdom led to paradise. That dying here, defending holy ground, was the greatest honor a Muslim could achieve.

*Subhana Rabbiyal Adheem.*

Glory be to my Lord, the Great.

The prayer continued. Ibrahim's mind was quiet, centered. Waiting for the door to open. Waiting for the presence.

And: there. It came.

Warmth spreading through his chest. The sense of being witnessed by something infinite. His brothers around him—he could feel them, their hearts beating in rhythm with his. The collective surrender creating space for God to enter. The tent filling with presence the way a room fills with light when you open curtains.

This was what faith felt like. Not belief. Not intellectual assent. But: encounter. Direct experience. God as real as the ground beneath him, as present as the air he breathed. Complete surrender, complete certainty, complete peace. No doubt. No questions. Just: being held in attention so vast and loving it made everything else—combat, death, fear, pain—irrelevant.

Three years in the militia. Dozens of engagements. Ibrahim had killed. Had watched brothers die. Had been wounded twice—once superficially, once seriously enough to require evacuation. Each time, his faith held. Not because he believed in paradise intellectually. Because he'd *felt* it. The presence in prayer was preview. Death would be returning to that light permanently. What was there to fear?

Simple. Clean. True.

*Allahu Akbar.*

They rose from prostration. Final movements. The prayer was nearly complete. Then: dinner, weapons maintenance, evening briefing. Routine and sacred both. Life structured by prayer and purpose.

Commander Hassan appeared at the tent entrance, breaking protocol. You didn't interrupt prayer. Not ever. But Hassan was standing there, face grim, waiting.

The imam saw him. Paused mid-recitation. "Brothers, hold. Commander?"

"Imam, everyone needs to hear this. Immediately."

The prayer dissolved. Forty fighters looking at each other, confused. In three years, Ibrahim had never seen prayer interrupted. Not for anything. Not even when they were under direct attack.

"The command tent," Hassan said. "Now. Everyone."

They moved quickly, abandoning their prayer mats. The evening light was fading to dusk. The camp sprawled across the hillside—a hundred and fifty fighters total, mix of tents and prefab structures. Jerusalem visible in the valley below, glowing in the twilight. Holy city. Contested city. Their city to defend.

The command tent was designed for thirty. A hundred and fifty fighters packed inside, standing shoulder to shoulder. The air was close and tense. Someone had pulled up a screen—UN broadcast, paused on the face of Secretary General Chen.

"Brothers," the imam said, moving to stand beside the screen. "The Commander has received news. Significant news. We will watch together and pray together. Whatever comes, we face it with faith."

That was concerning. The imam's face was composed, but Ibrahim could see tension in his shoulders. Whatever this was, it wasn't routine combat update.

Hassan activated the broadcast.

Ibrahim watched as Secretary General Chen explained: Near-Earth object detected. Collision course. Ninety-nine point nine seven percent impact probability. Fifteen years. Deflection impossible. Extinction inevitable. The screen showed a new calendar notation—Year 0—as if time itself had been reset to count down toward oblivion.

The tent was silent except for the Secretary General's voice. A hundred and fifty men listening to the calm explanation of the end of everything.

When the broadcast ended, nobody spoke. The silence stretched—five seconds, ten, thirty. Ibrahim felt something shifting inside him. Not panic. Not yet. But: a crack forming in the foundation.

The imam spoke first. "Brothers, this is a test. Allah tests those He loves. The faithful will be rewarded with paradise. This changes nothing about our purpose."

Murmurs of agreement. Some fighters nodding. Some looking stunned. Some already praying quietly.

"If anything," the imam continued, "this makes our struggle more meaningful. We defend this land until the last. We serve Allah until He calls us home. Fifteen years or fifteen minutes—our duty is the same. Our faith is unchanged."

More agreement. Stronger now. The brothers gathering themselves, returning to certainty. This was test. This was trial. Faith would see them through.

But Ibrahim was still feeling that crack.

He raised his hand—unusual, but permitted. "Imam, if everyone dies... Muslim, Christian, Jew, atheist... if the asteroid kills everyone regardless... what's the difference? What are we fighting for?"

The tent went quiet. A hundred and fifty pairs of eyes turned to him. Some sympathetic. Some shocked. Some hostile—you didn't question the imam. You didn't question the struggle.

The imam's face was patient. He'd fielded doubt before. "Brother Ibrahim, we fight because Allah commands it. The outcome is His will. Our duty is submission, not understanding."

"But the holy land will be destroyed," Ibrahim pressed. He could hear the crack widening in his own voice. "Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina—all of it. Gone. Vaporized. If that's Allah's plan, then what are we? What's the point of fighting for land that won't exist?"

"The point," the imam said firmly, "is obedience. The point is faith. The point is that we serve Allah, not outcomes. Whether we die in battle or by asteroid, whether Jerusalem stands or falls, our duty is unchanged: submission."

"That sounds like we're puppets," Ibrahim said quietly.

The imam's face hardened. "That sounds like you're losing faith, brother."

The tent was very quiet now. Dangerously quiet. Losing faith was serious. In combat zone, during trial, surrounded by believers—this was the worst time and place for doubt.

Commander Hassan stepped in. "Brothers, it's late. We're all processing difficult news. Let's rest. Tomorrow we'll discuss. For now: pray, reflect, trust in Allah."

The gathering dissolved. Fighters dispersing to tents, small groups forming, urgent conversations starting. Everyone processing. Everyone trying to understand how to integrate extinction into their worldview.

Ibrahim walked alone to his tent. A dozen brothers shared the space, but most were still outside, talking, praying, seeking community. He was grateful for the solitude.

He sat on his bedroll and pulled out his *misbaha*—prayer beads, ninety-nine beads for the ninety-nine names of God. He'd carried these beads since childhood. His father had given them to him at age seven. "Count the names," his father had said. "Remember Allah in every moment."

Ibrahim had worn these beads through madrasah, through training, through combat. They'd been in his pocket when he killed for the first time. They'd been in his hand when his brother Samir died beside him, shrapnel through the chest, blood everywhere, final words: *Allahu Akbar*. The beads were sacred. They were connection. They were reminder and comfort and purpose.

Now they felt like stones.

He tried to pray. Moved his fingers over the beads, one name per bead. *Ar-Rahman. Ar-Rahim. Al-Malik. Al-Quddus.* The Compassionate. The Merciful. The King. The Holy.

The names felt hollow. Just words. Just sounds. No resonance. No connection. He kept going, hoping the practice would restore meaning. *Al-Salam. Al-Mu'min. Al-Muhaymin.* The Source of Peace. The Inspirer of Faith. The Guardian.

Guardian of what? If everyone dies, what is being guarded?

He stopped at the forty-third bead. Sat with the string wrapped around his fingers. The weight was familiar—he could probably identify these specific beads in darkness. But the meaning was gone. Or fading. Or had never been there in the first place, and he was only now noticing its absence.

Footsteps outside his tent. The imam entered without asking—his privilege as spiritual leader.

"Brother Ibrahim. May I sit?"

"Of course, Imam."

The imam lowered himself with care—he was sixty, old for this life. They sat in silence for a moment, the sounds of camp filtering through the tent fabric. Prayers, conversations, someone crying quietly.

"You're troubled," the imam said.

"Yes."

"Tell me."

Ibrahim chose his words carefully. "Imam, I've believed my entire life. Believed totally. The faith made sense. Defending Jerusalem made sense. Martyrdom made sense—death leading to paradise, sacrifice for something greater. It all fit together."

"And now?"

"Now I don't understand how this fits. If everyone dies—righteous and wicked, believer and non-believer, all together—how is that justice? How is that mercy? If this is Allah's plan, what are we to Him? Toys? Entertainment? Why create us only to destroy us after a thousand generations?"

The imam was quiet for a long moment. "These are questions humans have asked since the beginning. Why does Allah allow suffering? Why does death come to the innocent? Why does evil seem to prosper? These questions don't have answers we can grasp. That's why we have faith."

"What if faith doesn't make sense anymore?"

"Faith isn't about sense, brother. Faith is about surrender. About trusting that Allah's wisdom exceeds our understanding. About submitting even when—especially when—we don't understand."

"That sounds like surrender to cruelty."

The imam's face showed pain. "Brother, you're young. Only nineteen. You haven't had time to develop the depth of understanding that sustains faith through trial. This news is shocking, I understand. But don't let the asteroid steal your faith. That would be dying before death."

"What if I can't stop it? What if the faith is already gone?"

"Then you pray for its return. You practice the rituals. You trust that Allah will restore what feels lost. Faith isn't constant feeling—it's constant practice. Even when it feels empty, you continue. The feeling returns."

"What if it doesn't?"

The imam stood slowly. "Then you're lost, brother. And I pray Allah guides you back."

He left. Ibrahim sat alone with his beads, feeling their weight, finding no meaning.

Outside, the brothers were still praying. He could hear their voices, collective and certain. They'd integrated this news into their faith. They'd found a way to believe that extinction was test, that Allah's plan was mysterious but perfect, that death by asteroid was no different than death by blade or bullet.

Ibrahim wanted to believe with them. Wanted the certainty back. Wanted the foundation restored.

But the crack had widened. And he couldn't ignore it anymore.

He tried to pray. Held the beads. Spoke the names. *Al-Aziz. Al-Jabbar. Al-Mutakabbir.* The Mighty. The Compeller. The Supreme.

Waited for the door to open. Waited for the warmth. Waited for the presence.

Nothing.

The words were empty. Just sounds in an empty tent. The door stayed closed. No warmth in his chest. No sense of being held. No feeling of vastness or light or love. Just: Ibrahim, alone, speaking to absence.

God didn't answer. Or God wasn't there. Or God was there but didn't care. Or—worst possibility—God had never been there. The feeling Ibrahim had chased since age twelve, the presence he'd felt hundreds of times, the direct encounter that made him willing to die... what if it was just brain chemistry? Just neurons firing in patterns that felt like meaning? Just human need for connection projected onto emptiness?

He'd lived his entire life for this faith. Structured every decision around it. Chosen this fight, this struggle, this potential martyrdom because he'd *felt* something real. Not just believed—experienced. The presence in prayer wasn't abstract theology. It was as real as another person in the room. More real. The most real thing Ibrahim had ever known.

And now: gone. The door closed. The warmth absent. The feeling vanished like it had never existed.

Now: an asteroid. Physics. Indifferent matter following indifferent laws toward indifferent collision. Fifteen years, then extinction. Muslim and non-Muslim alike. Righteous and wicked together. Jerusalem and Mecca and every holy site—vaporized. Every prayer said, every sacrifice made, every martyr died—all rendered meaningless by simple collision of matter and planet.

And the presence Ibrahim had felt—what was it? If everyone dies regardless, if righteousness and wickedness end the same way, if God allows His holy places to be vaporized and His faithful to be extinguished... then what was that warmth in prayer? What was that feeling of being held? What was that door opening in his chest when his brothers prostrated together?

Delusion? Wish fulfillment? Brain chemistry mistaken for divine encounter?

If that was Allah's plan, Ibrahim couldn't worship it. Couldn't surrender to it. Couldn't call it merciful or compassionate or any of the ninety-nine names he'd memorized.

And if the feeling wasn't real—if the most true thing Ibrahim had ever experienced was just neurons firing—then what?

His whole identity was wrapped in faith. Muslim. Fighter. Servant of Allah. Take that away and what remained? A nineteen-year-old with a gun defending land that wouldn't exist. Fighting enemies who would die with him. Serving cause that ended in fifteen years regardless of who won.

Meaningless. All of it. Suddenly, terribly meaningless.

He lay down on his bedroll, still holding the beads. Through the tent fabric, stars were emerging. Beautiful, distant, indifferent. Somewhere out there, an asteroid was falling toward Earth. Had been falling for millions of years. Would continue falling for fifteen more. Then: impact. Then: end.

God didn't create the asteroid. God didn't guide it. God didn't care about it. It was just: matter, following physics, approaching planet. Natural. Inevitable. Empty of meaning or malice or mercy.

Like everything else, maybe. Like life. Like death. Like the feeling Ibrahim had experienced in prayer—the warmth, the presence, the door opening in his chest. Maybe it was just: neurons, following patterns, creating sensations. Natural. Biochemical. Empty of divine presence or supernatural meaning.

Maybe the prayers Ibrahim had said five times daily for nineteen years were just sounds. Just words said into empty air. Just human need for pattern and purpose in a universe that offered neither.

Maybe God was never there. Maybe the feeling was always illusion. Maybe Ibrahim had structured his entire life around neurochemistry mistaken for the divine.

Ibrahim closed his eyes and tried to feel faith returning.

Felt nothing.

The beads were stones. The prayers were words. The faith was gone, or going, or had never been real in the first place.

Fifteen years left. He didn't know how to live them faithless. Didn't know who he was without the structure of belief.

But he couldn't make himself believe anymore. Couldn't surrender to a plan that seemed cruel, to a God that seemed absent, to a faith that didn't survive contact with physics.

Outside, his brothers prayed. Inside, Ibrahim lay in darkness, holding his beads, finding nothing but weight.

The crack had widened to chasm. And he couldn't see the other side anymore.

First night. Faith breaking. Nothing to replace it yet. Just: emptiness where certainty used to be.

*Allahu Akbar,* his brothers chanted.

God is greatest.

Ibrahim said nothing.

The beads were stones.

The prayers were empty.

The faith was gone.

And fifteen years remained to figure out what came after.
