# Chapter 58: Seven

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 15, Month 4, Days 1-7 | Antarctica**

---

Seven days remain.

Zara wakes to this knowledge the way she wakes to breathing—automatic, unavoidable, true. The number sits in her chest: seven. One week. One hundred and sixty-eight hours. Then: Maya dies. Kofi dies. Everyone dies.

She lies still, not ready to move yet. Kwame breathes beside her on the fold-out couch—they gave the bedroom to the children, claimed the living room for themselves. Fifteen years of marriage compressed into a government apartment in Antarctica. Home isn't place. Home is this: Kwame's warmth, his steady breath, the particular way he always wakes before her but pretends to sleep until she's ready.

Through the thin wall she hears Maya's restlessness—awake already, probably been awake for hours. Seventeen years, six months old. Eighty-five days of intensive training with Kenji complete. Mind still racing, always racing, even after three years, eight months of practice. Her daughter who became a teacher before becoming an adult.

Kofi's sleep is different—deep, untroubled. Fourteen years, five months. He practices presence without knowing he's practicing. Lives naturally what Maya works so hard to achieve. Grace of youth. Grace of not carrying the weight of knowing what knowing means.

Seven days.

Zara makes herself breathe. Wei's voice in memory: *Presence doesn't require certainty. Just: being here. Noticing fear. Returning gently.*

She's been practicing fifteen years. Since detection. Since the morning she burst onto Wei's balcony with Maya on her hip, both crying, both terrified. Fifteen years of learning impermanence through Wei's garden, through raising children toward death, through choosing life despite doom. Fifteen years should be enough to face seven days.

It's not enough. Will never be enough. But it's what she has.

Kwame's breathing changes. He stops pretending.

"You're awake," Zara whispers.

"So are you." His arm tightens around her. "Seven days."

"Yes."

They lie together in the grey dawn light. Outside, Antarctica stirs—over a million people in this megacity, all facing the same countdown. Somewhere Kenji is already preparing for morning teaching. Amara and David are probably drinking coffee in their apartment two buildings away. Elena is maintaining her morning ritual—fifteen years of briefings, now just: witness. Everyone showing up. Everyone present. Everyone choosing how to spend seven days.

"What do you want?" Kwame asks quietly. "For this week?"

Zara considers. What does she want from seven days? Miracle? Impossible. Acceptance? She's been practicing acceptance for fifteen years and still isn't there. Peace? Peace is performance. Presence is practice.

"Normal," she says finally. "I want normal. Breakfast together. Maya going to teach. Kofi exploring. You cooking. Me—" She stops. What does she do now? The Lagos water systems don't need her here. "Me being with you. Being with them. Just: family. Until we can't."

"Normal and final."

"Yes. Both."

Kwame kisses her forehead. "Then that's what we do."

---

Day 1 begins with breakfast.

Maya emerges from the bedroom first, already dressed, carrying her meditation journal. She's been documenting her practice since the awakening—three years, eight months of observations, questions, breakthroughs that weren't breakthroughs. The journal will burn in seven days. She writes in it anyway.

"Morning, Mama." Maya's voice is steady but Zara hears the tremor underneath. Her daughter is terrified. Her daughter is present anyway.

"Morning, baby. Sleep?"

"Some. Kofi snored."

"Did not!" Kofi bursts out of the bedroom, all energy despite the hour. "I don't snore! Maya, tell the truth!"

"You snored. Like a bear."

"There are no bears in Antarctica!"

"Exactly. So everyone noticed."

Zara smiles despite everything. This. This ordinary sibling bickering. This is what she chose when she had Kofi fifteen years ago. This normalcy. This life. Brief and complete and here.

Kwame has set the table—synth-protein, vegetables from the community greenhouse, tea. Simple meal. Perfect meal. They sit together. Four people. One family. Seven days of family left.

"What's the plan today?" Kofi asks around a mouthful of food.

"Manners," Zara says automatically.

He swallows. "Sorry. What's the plan?"

Maya answers before Zara can. "Morning teaching with Uncle Kenji. Then lunch with Aunt Amara—she wants to show me something about orbital mechanics. Then—" She glances at Zara. "Then I want to see Asha's installation. The one everyone talks about. 'Witness.' Will you come with me, Mama?"

Zara's chest tightens. The installation. She's heard about it—mirrors and countdown clocks and people confronting themselves. Asha Marin's final major work. Art as mirror. Truth as disturbing.

"Yes. I'll come."

"Can I come?" Kofi asks.

"It's intense," Maya warns. "Scary."

"I want to see."

Zara looks at her son. Fourteen years, five months of wanting to see everything, experience everything, be part of everything. Seven days left and he's still choosing curiosity over fear.

"Okay. We'll all go. After your morning activities." She looks at Kwame. "You too?"

"I'm helping with community kitchen prep. But afternoon—yes. Family time."

"Family time," Zara agrees. "All week. Every day. Together."

They eat in companionable silence. Zara notices everything—the sound of forks on plates, the morning light through the small window, Kofi's fidgeting, Maya's careful precision, Kwame's quiet presence. This moment. This morning. This family. Seven days of moments left.

Maya finishes first. "I should go. Uncle Kenji starts at eight."

"How many people come now?" Zara asks.

"Two hundred. Maximum capacity. Every session." Maya's face shows something between pride and grief. "Uncle Kenji says the teaching reached everyone who needed it. Now we just practice together until—" She stops.

"Until we can't," Zara completes. "That's enough."

"Is it?"

The question hangs. Is practicing presence until death enough? Zara doesn't know. But she knows the alternative—numbing, hiding, pretending—is worse.

"It's what we have," she says. "So yes. It's enough."

Maya nods. Stands. Hugs Zara tightly—sudden, fierce, desperate. "I love you, Mama."

"I love you, Maya. So much."

"See you at lunch?"

"See you at lunch."

Maya leaves. Kofi follows ten minutes later—promised to help Fatima organize something at the community center. Then it's just Zara and Kwame, clearing dishes in comfortable silence.

"She's scared," Kwame says quietly.

"Of course she's scared. She's seventeen. Three years of practice doesn't make dying at seventeen okay."

"But she'll die awake."

"Yes. That's something. That's still not enough."

Kwame pulls her close. They stand in the small kitchen holding each other. Fifteen years of this. Holding each other through impossible things. All of it led here: seven days, then nothing.

"Would you do it again?" Kwame asks. The same question he asked in Lagos, Year 6.

"Yes," Zara says without hesitation. "Every choice. Every moment. Even knowing. Especially knowing."

"Even now? Seven days left?"

"Even now. They're here. Real. Loved. That matters."

"For seven days."

"For seven days. For however long here is. Duration isn't the measure. Presence is."

She hears Wei in her own words. Fifteen years of transmission.

"I'm going to visit Amara," Zara says. "Before Maya's lunch session. Want to sit with my sister. Want to not waste time."

"Go. I'll be at the kitchen until three. Then we all go see the installation?"

"Yes. All of us. Family."

---

Amara's apartment is identical to theirs. Government housing. But Amara has made it home. Pictures. Books. Evidence of life.

Her sister answers the door. Sixty-three years old. Nine years of reconnection after seven of isolation.

"Zara." Amara hugs her. "I was hoping you'd come."

"Seven days. Can't waste them."

They sit on Amara's small couch. David is at the solar arrays—still maintaining despite seven days remaining. Still showing up. That's what he does.

"I'm sorry," Amara says suddenly.

"For what?"

"For wasting time. Seven years of not speaking. Then cautious reconnection. We could have had more years. Should have had more."

Zara takes her sister's hand. "We have what we have. You're here now. That's what matters."

"Is it enough? Nine years of reconnection after seven of silence? Against thirty-four years of being sisters?"

"Nothing's enough," Zara says honestly. "Not enough time with you. Not enough time with my children. Not enough time with Kwame. Not enough time for Maya to become who she might have been. Not enough time for Kofi to finish growing. Nothing is ever enough."

"Then why—"

"Because you're here. I'm here. Right now. That's complete."

Amara's eyes fill. "You sound like Wei."

"Good. She taught me everything that matters."

"I never met her. Just letters. But she saved me. Through letters, through Kenji, through you. Taught me how to feel again after seven years numb."

"She saved me too. Fifteen years ago. Showed up on her balcony crying with Maya. She taught me impermanence. Then she taught me presence to impermanence. Then she taught me that brief doesn't mean meaningless. Everything I am as a mother—she taught me."

They sit quietly. Sisters. Different paths to the same truth. Both transformed by the same teacher through different transmission.

"I'm glad we reconnected," Zara says. "Glad you called back Year 7. Glad you came to Lagos Year 9. Glad you're here now. Nine years isn't enough but it's real. It counts."

"Even if it all ends in seven days?"

"Especially because it ends in seven days. The ending makes it matter. Makes it sharp. Makes it real."

Amara wipes her eyes. "I love you. I should have said it more."

"You say it by being here. By showing up. By sitting with me right now instead of hiding in calculations. That's love."

A knock. David enters.

"Took break," he explains. "Wanted to see you both." He looks at Zara. "Seven days. Should we spend them maintaining arrays or with family?"

"Both," Zara says. Wei's answer. "Maintain what needs maintaining. Be with family when you can."

"Amara?" David looks at his partner.

"Go back to work. I'm here. I'll be here when you return."

David kisses Amara's forehead. Hugs Zara. "Thank you. For calling her back. Year 7."

"She saved herself. I just kept showing up."

"That's what saves people. Showing up."

He leaves. The sisters sit together until it's time for Maya's lunch session.

---

Afternoon brings the installation.

The four of them walk through District 5. The streets are fuller than usual. Final week. Everyone outside.

Asha's "Witness" installation stands in a converted warehouse. No security. No admission. Just: open space. The artist hasn't been here for weeks. The work stands alone.

They enter together.

The space is circular. Mirrors line the walls—floor to ceiling. Above: countdown clock projected. The numbers glow red: 6 days, 14 hours, 23 minutes, 17 seconds. Ticking down.

Mannequins stand throughout—all ages, all positions. No faces. Just forms. Witnesses watching witnesses.

Zara sees herself reflected infinitely. Forty-eight years old. Tired. Grieving. Present. Real.

Her family reflected too. Kwame. Maya. Kofi. All of them multiplied. All of them dying. All of them here.

"Mama," Kofi whispers. "It's us. Everywhere."

"Yes."

"We look small."

"We are small."

Maya moves deeper. Studies the mannequins. Her own reflections. She stands for a long time just: looking. Seeing herself seeing. The practice made physical.

Zara watches her daughter. Seventeen years, six months. Seven days left. Maya confronting her own mortality made visible.

"Mama, should we go in?" Maya had asked this morning. Now Zara understands. Going in means confronting. Seeing clearly.

"Do you want to?" Zara asks.

"I want to see myself before I'm gone."

They stand together. Mother and daughter. Mirrors reflecting them infinitely. Both here. Both dying. Both seen.

"We're here," Maya says quietly. "That's real."

"Yes," Zara agrees.

Zara looks at the numbers overhead. Six days, fourteen hours now. Not enough time. But right now: here.

"This is honest," Maya says. "It doesn't pretend. Just shows us: you're dying. See it. Be with it."

"Are you glad we came?"

"Yes. Wei would have liked this. Called it good teaching."

They stay forty-seven minutes. Zara times it unconsciously—engineering habit. Then they leave together, blinking in Antarctic light.

"That was intense," Kofi says.

"Yes."

"But good." He looks at his family. "We're really here. Really us. Really alive. The installation made me see it."

They walk home slowly. No rush. Nowhere to be. Seven days left and they choose to walk slowly through Antarctic cold, four people being family.

---

Day 2: Sisters.

Zara and Amara spend the day together. Walking. Talking. Being. Nine years of reconnection concentrated into hours.

They walk the Antarctic coast—engineered breakwater, frozen ocean beyond, the desolate beauty of a continent humans shouldn't inhabit but do anyway. Over a million people choosing to die here. Together.

"Tell me about our childhood," Amara says.

"Why?"

"Because I want to remember. Want to hold it. Seven years I didn't remember. Pushed it all away. Now—six days left—I want to remember everything."

So Zara tells her. Their parents in Lagos. Growing up in the compound. Amara always serious, always studying. Zara choosing engineering, choosing family, choosing ordinary life. Diverging paths. Both valid. Both complete.

"I chose career," Amara says. "You chose people. I thought my choice was better. More important. More meaningful."

"Was it?"

"No. Just different. You built family. Raised children. Created love. I calculated orbits. Both matter. Both temporary. But you—" Amara stops walking. "You created people who will die having been loved. That's—that's profound."

"So are your calculations. They're beautiful. The mathematics is beautiful even describing our death."

"It's not the same."

"No. But you're here. With me. Right now. That's what matters."

Amara is crying. "I'm sorry I wasted time."

"You didn't waste the end. That counts."

"Is it enough?"

"It has to be."

They hug on the Antarctic coast. Two sisters who almost lost each other but chose to find each other again. Nine years. Not enough. Real. Counted. Mattered.

They walk back slowly. Stop for tea at a community center. Hot drinks. Shared silence.

An older woman approaches. "Excuse me. Are you Zara Okafor-Mensah? I was at your Lagos compound. Year 3. You were living like your children's brief lives were worth everything. You taught me just by being there. Thank you."

She leaves before Zara can respond.

Amara is staring. "You showed people how to live. Just by living."

"I just raised my children."

They sit with their tea. Six days left. All the words said and unsaid between them.

"Tomorrow," Zara says. "Spend it with my children? With Kwame? With all of us? Not separate anymore—together?"

"Yes. Please. Yes."

---

Day 3: Maya's question.

Dinner. Four people at the small table. Synth-protein and vegetables and tea. Normal meal. Final meals. Both.

Maya has been quiet all day. Zara recognizes this—her daughter processing, integrating, preparing to speak truth. Seventeen years of watching Maya think.

"Mama," Maya says carefully. "Can I ask you something?"

"Always."

"Are you glad you had us? Knowing how it ends?"

The question Zara has been waiting for. The question she's asked herself thousand times. The question that matters more than anything.

She doesn't hesitate. "Yes. Every moment. Even knowing. Especially knowing."

"Why especially?"

"Because knowing made every moment matter. Made me present. Made me love fiercely. You got seventeen years. Kofi got fourteen. Not enough. Never enough. But real. Conscious. Loved. That matters more than long unconscious life."

Maya's eyes fill. "I don't want to die."

"I know, baby. Neither do I."

"Are you scared?"

"Terrified. But we're together. That helps."

Kofi speaks up. "I'm scared too. But less scared because we're family. Because we're together. Because I know you love me."

Zara looks at her children. Her defiant choices. Her conscious creations. Maya brilliant and fierce and dying at seventeen. Kofi innocent and joyful and dying at fourteen. Both here. Both real. Both loved beyond measure.

"I would choose you again," Zara says. Voice breaking. "Every time. Knowing everything. I would choose to bring you into this world. Would choose to love you. Would choose to be your mother for seventeen years and fourteen years. Not enough time. But enough love. Enough presence. Enough mattering."

"But we'll be gone," Maya whispers.

"Yes. In six days you'll be gone. And I'll be gone. And everyone will be gone. But right now—" Zara reaches across the table. Takes Maya's hand. Takes Kofi's hand. Kwame completing the circle. "Right now we're here. Together. Real. That's not nothing. That's everything."

They sit holding hands. Family. Brief. Complete. Here.

"Thank you for having us," Maya says quietly. "Even knowing. Thank you for choosing us."

"Thank you for being here," Zara responds. "Thank you for being exactly who you are. Thank you for teaching me. For showing me presence. For being my children."

Kofi starts crying. Then Maya. Then Kwame. Then Zara. Four people at a small table in Antarctica, crying together, holding each other, being family six days before family ends.

This is what she chose. This grief. This love. This presence. This everything.

Worth it. All of it. Even now. Especially now.

---

Day 4: Kofi.

Her son wakes with questions.

"Mama, why do we practice if we die anyway?"

They're making breakfast together—Kofi helps now, fourteen years old and competent in small ways. He measures tea carefully. Zara watches him move. Notices everything. Five days left of watching him.

"We practice so we're here," Zara says. "Present to the life we have. Not hiding from the death that's coming."

"But does it help? When the moment comes? Will practice make it easier?"

Zara doesn't lie. Wei taught her honesty. "I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. But practice makes now better. Makes this morning—you and me making tea—more real. More seen. More loved."

"So we practice for now, not for then?"

"Yes. Exactly."

Kofi absorbs this. "That makes sense. Uncle Kenji says the same thing. But simpler from you."

They finish breakfast preparation. Kwame and Maya join them. The morning routine. Five more mornings. Then: nothing.

After breakfast, Kofi wants to explore District 8. Zara goes with him. Mother and son. Five days of son left.

The outer district is quieter. Emptier. Kofi still points at things. Asks questions. Still curious despite knowing everything ends.

"Mama, look." He stops at a small garden—someone's balcony project. Vegetables growing in containers. Herbs spreading.

"Someone's still tending," Zara observes.

"Five days left and they water plants." Kofi's voice is wondering. "That's—that's what you teach, right? Maintenance matters even when it ends?"

"Yes."

"I understand now. Watching Uncle David with arrays. Watching you with family. Watching everyone show up. It's all the same. Do what needs doing. Be present while doing it."

Zara looks at her son. Fourteen years, five months. Five days left. Understanding through living what Maya had to study to learn. Both paths valid. Both her children. Both perfect exactly as they are.

"You're wise," Zara says.

"I'm fourteen."

"Wise anyway."

They walk home. Kofi talks about his friends, Kenji's teachings, practice, fear. Zara listens. Witnesses. Loves.

She watches him and thinks: he won't suffer the anticipatory grief Maya carries. He'll die younger but lighter. Both terrible. Both mercy.

"Mama," Kofi says. "I'm glad you're my mother."

"I'm glad you're my son."

"Even for only fourteen years?"

"Even for only fourteen years. You made those years matter. You made them real."

He hugs her. Right there in the street. Fourteen years old and not embarrassed. Five days left and choosing connection over coolness.

Zara holds him. Breathes him in. This specific Kofi smell—child and teenager mixed. This specific weight. This specific boy who won't ever be a man but is perfectly himself right now.

"I love you," she tells him.

"I love you too, Mama."

---

Day 5: Kwame.

The children are with Kenji—intensive session, final teachings. Zara and Kwame have the afternoon alone.

Rare solitude. They walk to their temporary apartment. Close the door. Stand in the small space that's been home for three months.

"Fifteen years," Kwame says.

"Fifteen years," Zara agrees.

"Would you marry me again? Knowing everything?"

"Yes."

"Would you have Maya and Kofi again?"

"Yes."

"Would you choose all of it? The compound. The gardens. The defiance. The presence. All of it?"

"Yes. Every choice. Every moment. Even knowing. Especially knowing."

Kwame pulls her close. "Me too."

They stand together. Fifteen years of marriage compressed into this embrace. Family created. Family maintained. Family facing ending together.

"Four days," Kwame says. "Then we watch them die."

"Yes."

"How do we do it?"

"We practice. We breathe. We hold their hands. We witness them completely."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

They make love. Slow. Present. Real. Not desperate goodbye. Not performance. Just: connection. Presence. Fifteen years of knowing each other. Four days left of knowing each other. Both held simultaneously.

Afterward, lying together, Kwame asks: "Do you have regrets?"

Zara considers. "Seven years of not speaking to Amara. Should have called sooner."

"But you did reconnect. Nine years together."

"Yes. Not enough but real."

"Other regrets?"

"No. Everything else I chose deliberately."

"Even though they die in four days?"

"Even though. They lived. Brief and complete and witnessed."

Kwame holds her tighter. "I love you."

"I love you."

"Thank you for choosing me. For building this with me."

"Thank you for showing up. Every day. For fifteen years."

They lie together until it's time to collect the children. Four days left of lying together. Of being married. Of being family. Not enough time. All the time there is.

---

Day 6: Family.

No work. No teaching. No maintenance. Just: four people being together.

They stay in the apartment. Cook together. Play games. Talk. Laugh. Cry. Be.

Zara watches them. Her family. Her deliberate creation. Kwame cooking, singing off-key. Maya reading but present. Kofi bouncing energy.

This. This is what she chose. Not abstract meaning. This: actual people. Actual love. Actual presence.

"Tell us stories," Maya requests. "About when we were little."

So Zara does. About Maya's first word (not "mama"—"more"). About Kofi learning to walk. About the Lagos compound. About Wei's garden. About ordinary moments made precious by attention.

Kwame adds his memories. Different perspective. Same love.

"We were happy," Maya observes.

"We are happy," Zara corrects. "Present tense. Right now. Happy."

"Even three days before we die?"

"Even three days before we die. Happy and sad. Grateful and grieving. Present to all of it."

The day passes slowly. Perfectly. Everything and nothing. Just: family. Together. Normal and final. Both.

Evening brings reflection.

"Tomorrow is the gathering," Maya says. "Final open practice. Two hundred people. Uncle Kenji wants me to co-teach."

"Are you ready?"

"No. But I'll do it anyway. That's what practice taught me. You don't wait for ready. You show up."

"We'll be there," Zara promises. "All of us. Witnessing you teach."

"Then what?"

"Then two more days. Then—"

"Then physics."

"Yes. Then physics."

They sit together in the small apartment. Four people. Three days from ending. All the love. All the presence. All the truth. Everything held together.

"I'm glad we're together," Kofi says. "For the end. Not alone."

"We'll never be alone," Zara tells him. "We're family. Until we can't be. Then we were family. Past tense. But real. Always real."

---

Day 7: Gathering.

The community center is packed.

Two hundred people fill the space—maximum capacity, bodies pressed close, sitting on cushions, chairs, floor. All ages. All here for final open practice before countdown.

Zara sits with her family near the middle. Can see Kenji at the front. Maya beside him—seventeen years, six months old, three days from death, teaching others how to face it.

The room holds everyone. Chen with his grandchildren. Ibrahim and Derek. Hassan and Fatima. Samir signing. Linnea steady now.

Young people fill the front rows. Teenagers facing death. Ife and Blessing—the girls Maya taught in Lagos. So many young faces.

Parents holding children. Elders witnessing. Zara's generation holding space between.

Marcus Reyes catches Zara's eye. Nods. Gray-haired and peaceful. Returned from Mumbai for this.

Adanna and Samuel from the Lagos compound. Chose to die here, with family.

Priya Patel across the circle. Practicing now despite years of withholding mercy.

Soso Kim near the back. Teaching presence through animal care.

Dr. Tanaka—Maya and Kofi's pediatrician. Fifteen years of well-child visits toward nothing.

Kenji rings the bell.

The room quiets. Two hundred people settling into meditation posture. Zara straightens. Closes her eyes. Returns to breath.

One. In.

Two. Out.

Her mind wanders immediately—three days, three days, three days—but she notices. Returns gently.

Three. In.

Four. Out.

Forty-five minutes of this. Two hundred people breathing together. Practicing together. Being present together. The silence profound. Sacred. Real.

When the bell rings again, Kenji speaks.

"This is all we've ever had. This moment. The asteroid didn't change that. Just made it visible. Be here. Be here. Be here."

Simple words. Wei's words. Truth passed person to person until no more persons. But right now: two hundred persons. Two hundred witnesses. Two hundred people choosing presence.

Maya speaks next. Her daughter's voice clear and steady.

"I'm seventeen. Three days left. I've practiced three years, eight months. It hasn't made dying at seventeen okay. But it's made living seventeen years real. That's—that's what I offer. Not comfort. Not answers. Just: being present to what is. However long what is lasts."

The room is completely silent. Everyone hearing. Everyone understanding. Everyone facing the same truth.

Ibrahim speaks. Then Derek. Then Hassan. Then others. Sharing. Witnessing. Teaching by being honest about not-knowing.

Then: final meditation. One hour. Two hundred people sitting together. Breathing together. Being together. Until they can't.

The silence is complete. Zara sits with her family. Kwame beside her. Maya and Kofi nearby. All of them breathing. All of them present. All of them here.

This is enough. Not in the sense of satisfying. In the sense of complete. This moment. This practice. This community. Complete.

The bell rings.

People stand. Stretch. Talk quietly. But not leaving yet—staying. Being together.

Dinner arrives. Fatima and Kwame coordinating. Two hundred people eating together. Laughter. Stories. Tears.

Zara sits with her family. Amara and David nearby. Elena and Kenji. Ibrahim and Hassan. Adanna and Samuel. Marcus. Soso. Everyone together.

This is what she built. Not just family—community. Presence spreading presence. Wei's teaching transmitted through simple act of showing up.

One day left. But tonight: everyone here. Everyone complete.

---

That night, Zara can't sleep.

Seven days complete. Tomorrow: the final day. Then: nothing.

She watches her family sleep. Maya restless—eighty-five days of intensive training complete, mind still racing. Kofi peaceful—fourteen years of presence without knowing he practiced it. Kwame breathing steady—fifteen years of partnership complete.

Fifteen years. Final week. Tomorrow begins the end. But tonight: breathing. Tonight: together. Tonight: alive.

She thinks about the gathering. Two hundred people practicing presence. Her daughter teaching. Her son learning. Her husband serving. Her sister witnessing. All choosing consciousness over numbness.

Wei would be proud.

Zara wishes Wei could see what her garden teaching became. Could see Maya and Kofi practicing. Could see the community holding each other.

But Wei is dead. Four years dead. Got to die her own death, ready, present, complete. Her final words: "The flower bloomed."

Yes, Zara thinks. The flower bloomed. Maya bloomed. Kofi bloomed. Family bloomed. Community bloomed. All of it temporary. All of it real.

One day left.

Zara makes a choice. The same choice she's made for fifteen years. The same choice she'll make tomorrow.

Be here. Be present. Love what she'll lose. Witness completely. That's all.

She closes her eyes. Sleeps briefly. Dreams of gardens.

Tomorrow begins the ending.

But tonight: alive. Together. Home.
