# Chapter 59: Countdown

**Multiple POVs | Year 15, Month 4, Final Day | Antarctica**

---

## 14 Hours, 23 Minutes

The alarm doesn't wake Amara. She's been awake for hours, watching the numbers on her terminal count down with mathematical precision. David sleeps beside her—rare gift, his body finally surrendering to exhaustion after seven days of final preparations. She doesn't wake him yet. Lets him have these last moments of not-knowing, of ordinary sleep, before the day that ends everything begins.

Her terminal shows the trajectory. Perfect. Unchanged. The asteroid exactly where physics said it would be. Impact in 14 hours, 23 minutes, 17 seconds. Pacific Ocean. Energy release equivalent to 100 million megatons. The numbers are beautiful in their precision. Terrible in their certainty.

She closes the display. Enough calculations. Fifteen years of tracking. Fifteen years of knowing exactly when everyone would die. Today that knowledge becomes irrelevant. Today everyone learns what she's always known: the physics is absolute.

David stirs. Opens his eyes. Sees her watching him.

"Morning," he says quietly.

"Final morning."

"Yes." He reaches for her hand. "Ready?"

"No. But here anyway."

They lie together in the grey dawn light. Through the thin walls they hear Zara and Kwame moving in the kitchen—preparing breakfast, maintaining ritual, choosing normalcy even now. Maya's voice, explaining something to Kofi. Family sounds. Life sounds. Fourteen hours of life sounds left.

"Platform 73?" David asks.

"Yes. You?"

"Yes. Together."

They rise. Dress. The apartment is crowded—six people in sixty square meters. Three months ago it was just them. Then Zara's family arrived. Migration. Convergence. Everyone choosing to die together rather than apart.

In the kitchen, Zara has made breakfast. Real food, not just nutrient bars. She's been hoarding ingredients for this day. Eggs—synth-protein but prepared carefully. Bread. Tea. Fruit. The table set properly, like it matters. Because it does. Because this is the last breakfast.

Maya sits with her meditation journal, writing. Kofi fidgets, unable to sit still despite knowing. Or because of knowing. Kwame cooks, his way of showing love, of being present, of doing something when there's nothing to be done.

"Good morning," Zara says. Not falsely cheerful. Just: present. Fifteen years of practice in those two words.

They eat together. Six people. One family. Fourteen hours of family left.

Maya sets down her pen. "I finished my final entry."

"What did you write?" Amara asks.

"That I'm terrified and grateful both. That seventeen years, seven months wasn't enough but was real. That I loved and was loved and that's complete." Her voice is steady. "That the flower bloomed."

Wei's words. The teaching passed through Zara to Maya. Impermanence made visible. Beauty despite brevity.

Kofi reaches for another piece of bread. "I'm still hungry. Is that weird? Final day and I'm hungry."

"Bodies don't know about asteroids," David says. "They just know: alive right now. Hunger is appropriate."

They finish breakfast slowly. No rush. Nowhere to be except here, together, present. Then: the day begins.

## 13 Hours, 47 Minutes

Platform 73 appears in the grey morning light. Two hundred meters above the ice. David and Amara climb together, harnesses clipped, the routine automatic after years of repetition. The transport dock empties behind them. The city spreads below—one point eight million people beginning their final day.

47B waits at the central junction. Treads positioned precisely. Sensors focusing as they approach.

*Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague Chen. Dr. Okafor. Final day confirmed. Impact in 13 hours, 47 minutes, 22 seconds. All systems functioning at optimal parameters. Awaiting final maintenance instructions."

David almost laughs. "Still tracking systems."

*Beep.* "This unit's function is maintenance coordination until cessation of function. Thirteen hours, forty-seven minutes of function remain. Shall we proceed with scheduled tasks?"

Amara looks at David. The absurdity and beauty both visible. Maintaining arrays that will vaporize. Working until work becomes impossible. The robot understanding this perfectly—function until cessation.

"Yes," David says. "Let's maintain what needs maintaining."

They work together—human, human, robot. The rhythm built over years. Connection housings checked. Voltage regulators calibrated. Panels cleaned despite knowing they'll never convert another day's sunlight. The work is meditation. Presence made physical. Meaning through action, not outcome.

Amara finds herself present to her hands on the diagnostic tablet. Her breath in the cold air. David's quiet competence beside her. 47B's steady glide between platforms. This moment. This work. This partnership. Brief and complete.

"Fourteen years," she says during platform seventeen. "You've been doing this fourteen years."

"Feels longer. Feels shorter." David tightens a connection. "Feels exactly right."

"Did you find it? What you were looking for?"

He pauses. Considers. "I wasn't looking. Just showing up. But somewhere along the way, showing up became enough. Became everything."

They work in companionable silence. The sun climbs higher. Below, the megacity continues—people waking, eating, preparing. Some gathering in community spaces. Some staying home. Some walking outside for final views of Antarctic ice. Everyone choosing how to spend thirteen hours.

At 11:00 AM, they stop for tea. Sit on the platform edge with legs dangling over empty air, safety harnesses clipped. David unpacks the thermos Zara prepared. They drink slowly.

"Any regrets?" Amara asks.

"Years 1 through 4. Wasting time being broken instead of trying to heal." He sips his tea. "But I learned from it. Became this because of it. So: regret and gratitude both."

"Both/and."

"Yes. Always both." He looks at her. "You?"

"Seven years of isolation. Should have called Zara sooner. Should have met Kofi as a baby, not a twelve-year-old." She watches the city below. "But I'm here now. Three months with them. That's something. That's real."

They finish their tea. Return to work. Hours passing. Systems holding. Everything functioning until it can't.

---

## 11 Hours, 19 Minutes

The community center fills slowly. Elena watches from the doorway as people arrive—some alone, some in family groups, some in the clusters that formed over years of practice. One thousand two hundred people choosing to face the end together. Choosing witness over isolation.

Marcus Rivera appears at her elbow. "Packed house."

"Everyone who chose Antarctica. Everyone who stayed." She steps inside. "Our final gathering."

The space transforms as people settle. Chen and Kowalski near the front—fifteen years of Thursday practice, fifteen years of briefing family. Both sitting with the quiet dignity of men who showed up to impossible work for decades. Dr. Sarah Kim coordinating quietly, old journalist habits applied to final logistics. Asha Marin in the back, watching people watch themselves, her installation already doing its work just by existing elsewhere in the city.

Priya Patel arrives with Aanya. Mother and daughter, both practicing, both carrying rage and gratitude. Priya's son Dev chose elsewhere—that's valid too. Different paths. Different ways of facing death. Priya has stopped judging her own hardness. Stopped needing to be healed. Just: honest about where she is. Present to rage and compassion coexisting.

Adanna and Samuel from Lagos. They arrived last week—couldn't bear to be apart from Zara's family in final days. Adanna, who defended Zara's choice to have Kofi fifteen years ago. Samuel, now twenty, who got to live because mothers chose life despite doom. Both here. Both grateful. Both terrified.

Derek arrives with his veteran group. Twelve people who learned adaptive movement together. Bodies broken, minds learning presence through physicality. He nods to Elena—former Marine who lost faith but found practice. Steady presence until the end.

Fatima organizing hospitality even now. Making sure people have water, have cushions, have space. Jordanian woman whose faith never wavered but expanded to hold everyone. Samir beside her, signing greetings, teaching that presence speaks in more than words. Deaf Syrian who showed others that silence isn't absence.

Linnea enters hesitantly. Two years clean. Shaking still. Fragile still. But here. Choosing presence over escape for final hours. The recovery group around her—people who taught each other that transformation is possible even at the end.

Barak Naveh sits quietly mid-room. Eighteen months since his release. Calm presence that others gravitate toward. Not teaching. Just: being. Shaped by guilt, not consumed. Modeling that carrying weight doesn't require drowning in it.

Obi Nwosu uncrosses his arms. Three years of skeptical practice. Still uncertain. Still showing up. His engineering mind recognizing what his emotions can't quite accept: maintenance as meaning, presence as purpose. He's here. That's complete.

Soso Kim arrives late. Twelve dogs waiting at the kennel with seven volunteers. She'll return to them soon. But first: community. First: witness. Her five years of practice visible in how she moves—environmental grief transformed into presence with current life. The dogs don't need her every moment. They just need her to show up. Same as people.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka sits observing. Maya and Kofi's pediatrician fifteen years. Witnessed their complete childhoods. Measured growth toward no future. Her clinical practice transformed into sacred witness. She's here because presence medicine is all medicine now.

The young adults cluster together. Thabo, Amara (chemistry student), Jamal, others. The ones dying youngest. The ones with most to rage about. All practicing anyway. All choosing consciousness over numbness. Maya's taught them well.

Elena moves to the front. Not as mayor—that ended months ago. Just as witness. As person who chose to show up for seventeen years.

She speaks simply. "Eleven hours remain. Then: physics. Then: silence. We can spend these hours however we choose. Some will rage. Some will grieve. Some will practice. All valid. All honored. All witnessed."

She pauses. Looks at the gathered faces. "I'm glad we're together. Glad we chose this. Not because it makes death easier. Because it makes life realer. Because witness matters. Because showing up for each other—right up until we can't—that's everything."

Silence. Then someone starts singing. Old song, folk melody, words about home. Others join. Not performance. Just: voices together. Community made audible. Presence through sound.

Elena sits beside her son. Kenji glances at her, nods. Mother and son. Seventeen years of transformation. Both learning presence through crisis. Both teaching now. Both ready as anyone can be.

Marcus Reyes on her other side. Returned from Mumbai three months ago. Thirteen years teaching refugee children. Now: home. With chosen family. Complete.

They sit together as the song continues. One thousand two hundred people singing. Not hope. Not resignation. Just: here. Together. Conscious until consciousness ends.

## 9 Hours, 43 Minutes

Kenji's apartment is small. Designed for two people, maybe three. Seventeen people pack inside. The intimacy matters. The closeness matters. Final teaching not for crowds but for family.

Maya sits beside him. Ibrahim on his other side. Hassan next to Ibrahim—imam and fighter, reconciled through both/and. Derek, Samir, Fatima forming their cluster. Linnea beside Derek, steady despite trembling. Barak calm in the corner. Marcus Reyes observing quietly. A few others—students who chose intimate over communal.

And Kofi. Fourteen years, five months. The youngest here. Sitting cross-legged, fidgeting slightly, but present. Choosing to be with his sister's teacher for final practice.

"We'll sit for an hour," Kenji says. "Simple practice. Breath. Body. This moment. Then: we talk if words come. Then: silence if silence comes. Then: we're together until we decide to part."

He rings Wei's bell. The sound cuts through everything. Clear. Complete. Final.

They close their eyes. Seventeen people breathing together.

Kenji notices his breath. In. Out. In. Out. His mind wanders immediately—thinks about Wei, about Picture Nine (returning to source—home was always here), about Picture Ten (marketplace with gift-bestowing hands—teaching until teaching ends). Returns gently. Just: breath.

Beside him, Maya breathes with fierce concentration. Two years, eight months of practice. Eighty-five days of intensive training. Final hours of being seventeen. She knows she's dying. Practices anyway. Chooses presence despite terror. The transmission complete—Wei to Zara to Maya to everyone she's taught.

Ibrahim breathes unevenly. Still struggling. Still showing up. Three years since the voice at 3 AM. *Do you really think I brought you here to forget about you?* Faith returned differently. Not certainty. But accompaniment. God present without intervening. Walking with him through death. Enough. Not enough. Both.

Hassan beside him breathing prayers. Decades of practice. Still uncertain. Still faithful. Both/and instead of either/or. Islam and presence practice merged. Different doors to same truth: be here, love what you'll lose, witness completely.

Derek breathes steadily. Marine discipline translated to meditation discipline. Fifteen years teaching adaptive movement. Bodies broken but capable. His breathing steady as platform maintenance, reliable as morning routines. Presence through physicality.

Samir's breathing is silent. But his hands move slightly—signing prayers in space. Visual worship. Embodied devotion. Teaching that presence manifests in more than one form. That silence isn't absence. That attention is prayer.

Fatima breathes and weeps quietly. Faith intact. Heart breaking. Both true. Faithful Muslim who never lost God but learned to hold everyone's doubt without diminishing it. Her breathing becomes her prayer.

Linnea struggles. Shaking. Craving rising—always rises under stress. But she doesn't run. Breathes through it. Two years clean. Final hours clean. The practice holding her when nothing else can. Derek's hand moves slightly toward hers—offering steadiness without demanding anything.

Barak breathes easily. Eighteen months of freedom made sacred by years of reflection. Guilt carried without being consumed. The breathing comes naturally—presence learned through confinement, practiced through liberty. Peace not as destination but as current state.

Kofi gets bored at minute twelve. Opens his eyes. Watches everyone else. Closes them again. Tries. Returns. Fidgets. Tries again. Fourteen years old, practicing presence the only way he can—honestly, imperfectly, here.

The hour passes. The bell rings again.

Eyes open. Seventeen faces. Some peaceful. Some tear-streaked. Some frustrated. All present.

"Anyone want to speak?" Kenji asks.

Silence. Then Maya: "I'm so scared."

"I know," Kenji says.

"Practice didn't fix that. Two years, eight months. Still terrified."

"Practice doesn't fix fear. Just teaches you to be present to it. You're doing that. That's complete."

Ibrahim speaks next. "I still don't understand meaning. Why any of this mattered if it just ends. But I'm grateful anyway. Grateful for this—" He gestures at the room, at the people. "Nine years with you all. Kept me alive. Taught me presence. That's something. That's—" His voice breaks. "That's everything, maybe."

Hassan adds: "Allah is with us. I believe that now differently than I did fifteen years ago. Not watching from above. Here. In this room. In our breathing. In our fear. In our love. Accompanying us through death. That's faith. That's enough."

They continue. Each person speaking or not speaking. Each presence honored. Each fear witnessed. Each gratitude named.

Until they settle into silence again. Seventeen people just: being together. No more words. Just: breath. Bodies. Moment. Together.

Nine hours until impact. Nine hours of this. Then: whatever comes next.

## 7 Hours, 11 Minutes

Zara's family stays home. Their temporary apartment in Building 14. Four people in two rooms. Crowded. Perfect. Together.

They play a game. Kofi's choice. Old board game, strategy and luck mixed. Maya wins the first round. Kofi protests loudly. Kwame referees gently. Zara watches her family play and feels: not peace. Not acceptance. But presence. Being here completely with people she loves. That's all she has. That's everything she has.

Between rounds, Maya asks: "Mama, were we enough? Did we do it right?"

Zara pulls her daughter close. "You were perfect. Are perfect. Seventeen years of you being you—that's complete. Not long enough. Never long enough. But complete."

"I wanted more time."

"I know, baby. I want that for you so badly. But wanting doesn't change physics. What we have is these seven hours. This family. This love. That's real."

Kofi joins the embrace. Then Kwame. Four people holding each other. Family until family becomes impossible.

They return to the game. Playing carefully. Laughing occasionally. Being normal on an abnormal day. Choosing ordinary. Choosing present. Choosing each other.

At 3:00 PM, they make tea. Wei's mint—cuttings from Min-seo's plant, grown on their Lagos balcony, brought to Antarctica as seeds, cultivated here against all logic. The plant thrives somehow. One more proof that brief life matters.

They drink tea slowly. Seven hours until they die. Seven hours of tea, of games, of conversation, of silence, of family. Not enough. Everything.

---

## 5 Hours, 36 Minutes

The countdown accelerates. Hours becoming visceral. Everyone feeling time collapse.

At Platform 73, Amara and David finish their final repair. Systems holding at ninety-three percent. Perfect function. Useless function. Beautiful function. They sit together watching the megacity below. Nearly two million people making final choices.

47B approaches. *Beep beep.* "All systems optimal. Five hours, thirty-six minutes of function remaining. Colleague Chen. Dr. Okafor. This unit wishes to express: working with humans has been optimal experience. Gratitude for partnership."

David laughs and cries simultaneously. "Thank you, 47B. You've been the best colleague."

*Beep.* "Acknowledged. Shall we remain at this platform until cessation? This unit calculates optimal human emotional outcomes from continued proximity."

"Yes," Amara says. "Let's stay together."

They sit. Three beings—two human, one mechanical. Partners in maintenance. Friends through repetition. Present until the end.

At the community center, Elena walks among the gathered. One thousand two hundred people in various states—some meditating, some talking, some crying, some laughing. All together. All choosing community over isolation.

She stops beside Chen and Kowalski. "Fifteen years of morning briefings."

"Five thousand four hundred seventy-five," Chen says automatically. "More or less."

"Worth it?"

"Every single one," Kowalski answers.

They sit together. Three government officials who tried to maintain impossible systems through impossible times. All of them failed by any objective measure. All of them succeeded at the only thing that mattered: showing up.

Kenji's apartment empties slowly. People choosing their final locations. Some staying, some leaving for elsewhere. Maya and Kofi head home to their parents. Ibrahim and Hassan to the mosque for final prayers. Derek and his group to walk meditations. Everyone choosing. Everyone honored.

Seventeen becomes twelve becomes seven becomes three. Kenji, Marcus Reyes, Barak. They sit in silence. Different faiths. Different paths. Same destination. Same presence.

"Picture Ten," Kenji says quietly. "Marketplace with gift-bestowing hands. Teaching until there's no one left to teach. Then: returning to source. Then: home."

"Home," Marcus echoes.

They sit together. Three men who found presence through different doors. All arriving here. All complete.

---

## 3 Hours, 22 Minutes

At Building 14, Zara cooks final dinner. Real food, saved for this moment. Pasta—synth-wheat but prepared carefully. Sauce made from hoarded tomatoes. Bread. Wine—one bottle, saved for fifteen years.

Four people eating slowly. Savoring. Present. Kofi talks about the game. Maya reads a passage from her meditation journal. Kwame tells a story from twenty years ago, before the asteroid, when futures existed. Zara listens and loves and witnesses.

They finish. Clean dishes together. The ritual matters. The normalcy matters. Doing ordinary things on the last day.

Then they move to the living room. Sit together on the floor. Four people in a circle. Holding hands.

"I love you," Zara says. "All of you. So much."

"I love you, Mama," Maya says.

"Love you," Kofi adds.

"Love you all," Kwame finishes.

They sit. Breathing. Together. Three hours until they die. Three hours of this. Enough. Not enough. Both. Always both.

---

## 1 Hour, 47 Minutes

The megacity quiets. Nearly two million people in final moments. Some still moving—walking, gathering, seeking. But most: settled. In chosen places. With chosen people. Waiting.

The community center holds its one thousand two hundred. Silent now. Breathing together. Elena sits beside Kenji, beside Marcus Rivera, beside Marcus Reyes. Four people who became family through apocalypse. All present. All ready as possible.

Priya Patel holds Aanya's hand. Mother and daughter. Rage and compassion both. Unforgiveness transforming through presence. Not healed. Just: honest. That's enough.

Derek sits with his veterans. Twelve bodies broken in different ways. All present. All practicing. All witnessing each other. Steady until they can't be.

Fatima prays quietly. Samir signs prayers beside her. Linnea shakes but doesn't run. Barak breathes calmly. Obi sits with arms uncrossed, finally surrendered to uncertainty. Chen and Kowalski side by side, Thursday practice complete.

Soso Kim returns to the kennel. Twelve dogs. Seven volunteers. They sit with the animals. Mochi (sixteen, blind) sensing something wrong. Scout (three legs) restless. Luna (deaf) calm. The others scattered—anxious, confused, present. Soso touches each one. Witnesses each one. Loves them completely. Brief life mattering absolutely.

At Platform 73, Amara and David sit in silence. 47B beside them. Three beings watching the horizon. Waiting for the light.

At the mosque, fifty people pray. Ibrahim and Hassan leading. Muslim and presence teacher merged. Different forms of same practice: surrender. Witnessing. Loving what you'll lose. Being here until here ends.

At Kenji's apartment, silence. Just: breathing. Three men present. Complete.

At Building 14, four people holding each other. Zara's family. Together until together becomes impossible. The promise kept. No one alone. Everyone loved. Everyone witnessed.

---

## 47 Minutes

The asteroid becomes visible. Distant speck. Growing. Mathematics made manifest. Physics becoming real.

Amara watches it through her portable terminal. Trajectory perfect. Speed constant. Impact inevitable. Fifteen years of calculations confirmed. The universe indifferent. The physics absolute.

But beside her: David. His hand in hers. Warm. Real. Present. And that—that tiny human warmth against cosmic indifference—that matters. Means something. Is something.

*Beep beep.* "Asteroid visible. Impact trajectory confirmed. Forty-seven minutes to cessation. Colleague Chen. Dr. Okafor. This unit's function ends soon. Gratitude for everything."

"Thank you, 47B," David says. "You made it matter."

---

## 28 Minutes

Time collapsing. Minutes feeling like seconds. Everyone breathing faster. Hearts pounding. Bodies knowing.

Maya writes final words in her journal: *The flower bloomed. Seventeen years, seven months. Brief. Beautiful. Real. I'm ready. I'm terrified. Both. I love my family. I'm grateful. I'm here.*

She sets down the pen. Closes the journal. Looks at her family. "I'm done. That's complete."

Kofi: "I'm scared, Mama."

Zara: "I know, baby. Me too. But we're together. That helps. That's everything."

---

## 14 Minutes

The city watches the sky. The asteroid huge now. Impossible to miss. Reality approaching. Everyone seeing. Everyone understanding. Everyone present to what's coming.

At the community center, people hold each other. Strangers and friends and family mixed. Human proximity. Witness. Love. Terror. Gratitude. All of it. All at once.

Elena thinks about Daniel Okonkwo. Hopes he found peace somehow. Hopes mercy matters somewhere. Carries his weight without being consumed. Both/and. Always both.

Kenji thinks about Wei. The flower bloomed. Home was always here. Ten Pictures complete. Teaching transmitted. Presence practiced. Enough.

Ibrahim feels the presence. Not intervening. Not saving. But here. Accompanying. *I was always here.* Faith differently. Enough.

---

## 7 Minutes

Zara holds her children. Kwame holds all of them. Four people breathing. Crying. Here. Together.

Maya: "Thank you for having me. For raising me. For teaching me. For loving me."

Zara: "Thank you for being you. For blessing us. For living fully. For being present."

Kofi: "I don't want to die."

Zara: "I know, baby. Neither do I. But we're together. We're together. We're together."

---

## 3 Minutes

Everyone in final positions. Final breaths. Final moments of consciousness. Humanity's last minutes.

At Platform 73: Amara, David, 47B. Watching. Together.

At community center: One thousand two hundred people. Holding. Witnessing. Present.

At mosque: Fifty people praying. Surrendering. Both meanings.

At Building 14: Four people. Family. Complete.

At kennel: Twelve dogs, seven humans. Life witnessing life.

Everywhere: people. Conscious. Here. Brief. Real. Mattering.

---

## 1 Minute

The asteroid fills the sky. Massive. Inevitable. Beautiful in its terrible way. Physics made manifest. Mathematics made real. The end approaching.

Amara thinks: *The calculations were perfect.*

David thinks: *I showed up. That was enough.*

Zara thinks: *They were loved. That's everything.*

Maya thinks: *I was here. Completely. That's complete.*

Kofi thinks: *Mama's holding me. I'm not alone.*

Elena thinks: *I witnessed. That mattered.*

Kenji thinks: *Home. We're home.*

Ibrahim thinks: *You were here. All along.*

Everyone thinking. Everyone present. Everyone conscious until—

---

## 30 Seconds

Hands holding hands. Bodies pressed together. Breath synchronized. Hearts pounding. Eyes open or closed. Fear. Love. Presence. All of it.

The light building. The heat building. Physics fulfilling itself.

Twenty seconds.

Everyone breathing. Everyone here. Everyone—

Fifteen seconds.

*I love you.*

*I'm here.*

*Together.*

Ten seconds.

The asteroid hitting atmosphere. The light beginning. Massive. Bright. Growing.

Five seconds.

Everyone holding. Everyone present. Everyone—

Three.

Two.

One.

The light—

---

**Impact.**

Pacific Ocean. Energy released. One hundred million megatons. Heat. Blast. Shockwave. Propagating at speed beyond escape. Beyond shelter. Beyond survival.

At Platform 73, systems failing. Arrays vaporizing. The platform falling. 47B's sensors detecting catastrophic system failure. David holding Amara. Both present. Both here. Until—

At Building 14, the shockwave approaching. Thirty seconds to arrival. Zara holding her children. Kwame holding all of them. Four people together. Breathing. Present. Witnessing each other. Loving each other. Until—

At community center, the walls shaking. People holding tighter. One thousand two hundred consciousnesses. Present. Together. Witnessing. Until—

The light consuming everything.

The shockwave consuming everything.

The heat consuming everything.

Everyone—

All of them—

Together—

Until—

---

Consciousness ending.

Presence ending.

Witness ending.

But for fifteen years: they tried.

For fifteen years: they loved.

For fifteen years: they were here.

That happened.

That mattered.

That was enough.

Until it ended.

As everything ends.

As everything always ends.

The flower bloomed.

Then faded.

As flowers do.

As everything does.

Home.
