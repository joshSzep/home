# Chapter 48: Arrival

**Dr. Amara Okafor | Year 15, Month 1 | Antarctica**

---

3:47 AM.

Amara woke to silence and for one disoriented moment thought she was still at the monitoring station. Same darkness. Same cold. Same solitude that had defined seven years of her life. Then she remembered: Lagos. David beside her. Family in the next room.

Family.

She turned her head carefully. David slept on his side, breathing steady and deep. Sixty-three years old and still beautiful to her in ways she couldn't have articulated seven years ago when numbness made everything distant. Now: she could see him. Really see him. The grey in his hair. The lines around his eyes. Fifteen years of maintenance work written on his body. Fifteen years of choosing to show up.

The apartment was quiet. Small—sixty square meters, standard Antarctic housing, Building 14, Unit 7B. Two bedrooms, shared living space, kitchenette. They'd moved in three years ago when they arrived from Lagos. Made it theirs—David's few belongings from his solo years, Amara's monitoring equipment mostly abandoned, plants Kwame had gifted them that somehow survived despite their inadequate care.

Yesterday they'd rearranged everything. Cleared the second bedroom that had been storage. Made space for family. Four more people in sixty square meters designed for two.

They arrived at 18:00. Amara had been checking the time every seven minutes. 17:23. 17:30. 17:37. The precision of anxiety. David had laughed gently: "They'll be here when they're here." But he'd been anxious too—she could tell by the way he'd reorganized the kitchen three times.

Then: door chime. 18:02.

Amara had opened it and there they were. Zara first—forty-eight years old, grey threading through her hair, exhausted from travel but smiling. Real. Here. Her sister who she'd ignored for seven years and slowly rebuilt connection with over the last eight. Behind her: Kwame, solid and steady. Then Maya—

Maya had stopped in the doorway. Seventeen years, three months old. Tall. So tall. The last time Amara saw her, she'd been fourteen. Three years of growth. Three years of transformation into someone who looked almost adult but would never reach eighteen.

"Aunt Amara," Maya had said quietly. Not a question. Acknowledgment.

"Maya." Amara's throat had closed. "You're—you grew."

"People do that." A slight smile. Not sarcastic. Just: honest. Maya's way. Direct. Present. Real.

Then Kofi had bounded past everyone, all energy and life, and thrown his arms around Amara's waist. "Aunt Amara! We're here! We made it! Is this your apartment? It's smaller than Lagos but I like it. Where's my room? Can I see? Is Uncle David here?"

Fourteen years, three months old. The last time she'd seen him was Year 12, Month 9—two years ago, quick visit during a teaching tour Kenji organized. Kofi had been twelve then. Now: fourteen. Voice deeper. Face changing. Becoming teenager. Still joy personified.

Amara had hugged him back—awkward but real. "Yes. He's here. You'll share the second room with Maya. It's small."

"That's okay! Maya and I always shared in Lagos! Right, Maya?"

Maya had smiled. "Right."

They'd come inside. The apartment suddenly full. Five adults and two teenagers in a space designed for two felt like too many bodies and exactly right simultaneously. Bags everywhere. The mint plant Kofi carried carefully—cutting from Wei's garden, green and alive despite the journey. Zara crying while trying not to cry. David emerging from the kitchen with tea for everyone. Kwame examining the apartment layout with an engineer's eye. Maya moving to the window immediately, looking out at the Antarctic megacity sprawling in all directions.

"So many lights," she'd said quietly.

"Two million people still here," Amara had replied. "Was four billion at peak. Most left."

"Where did they go?"

"Other places. Chosen places. Everyone deciding where to face the end."

Maya had nodded. Processing. "We chose here."

"Yes."

"Family," Maya had said simply. Not a question. Statement of fact.

"Yes. Family."

They'd eaten synth-protein and vegetables David prepared. Talked in fits and starts. Exhaustion made conversation difficult. Zara kept touching Maya's shoulder, Kofi's hand, like confirming they were real. Kwame quiet but present. David and Amara exchanging glances—Are we doing this right? Is this enough?

By 21:00, everyone was asleep. Kofi claimed the bottom bunk in the second bedroom. Maya took the top. Zara and Kwame settled on the fold-out couch in the living area—insisted on it despite offers of the bed. "You've been here three years," Zara had said. "This is your home. We're guests."

"You're family," Amara had corrected. But they'd taken the couch anyway.

Now: 3:47 AM. Everyone sleeping. Amara awake, mind calculating.

**90 days remaining.**

Ninety days to be sister, aunt, family. Ninety days to know Kofi properly—the nephew she'd met six times total. Ninety days to know Maya beyond quarterly visits. Ninety days to not waste.

She slipped out of bed carefully. David didn't wake—twelve years of solar array maintenance taught him to sleep deeply when sleep was possible. Amara pulled on a sweater, moved quietly through the dark apartment.

Living room: Zara and Kwame on the fold-out couch, Kwame's arm around Zara even in sleep. Nineteen years married. Two children growing toward death. Still here. Still choosing each other. Amara felt something in her chest—not quite envy. More like: recognition that they'd chosen differently. They'd chosen presence when she'd chosen isolation. They'd built life when she'd calculated death.

Who was happier? Amara didn't know. But she knew who was more human.

The second bedroom door was ajar. Amara looked in.

Kofi: sprawled on the bottom bunk, covers kicked off, mouth slightly open. Sleeping like children sleep—completely, trustingly, without awareness of danger. Fourteen years, three months old. Would be fourteen years, six months when he died. Would die before Maya. Younger. Less time. Less everything.

Amara's hands started shaking. She pressed them against her thighs. Breathe. Count. Four in, four out. Presence practice Zara had taught her, learned from Wei, passed forward because that's what humans did—tried to help each other survive the unsurvivable.

Maya: perfectly still on the top bunk, covers pulled up, lying on her back. Eyes closed but—Amara watched closer. Not asleep. Breathing wrong for sleep. Awake. Lying still in the dark. Doing what? Meditating? Thinking? Being present to insomnia?

"Aunt Amara?" Maya's voice, barely audible. "You okay?"

Amara should have moved away. Should have let her niece sleep or meditate or whatever she was doing. Instead: "Yes. Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you."

"I wasn't asleep." Maya opened her eyes. Turned her head slightly. Even in darkness, her expression was clear—aware, present, seeing. "Couldn't sleep. New place. Different sounds."

"Do you want tea?"

"Okay."

They moved to the kitchenette. Amara heated water—real kettle, not synthesizer. David insisted on it. Said ritual mattered even when nothing else did. She pulled down two cups. Found the tea Zara had brought from Lagos—some herbal blend from the compound garden. The smell was unfamiliar, earthy, alive.

Maya sat at the small table. Watched Amara move. Didn't fill the silence. Patient. Present. So much like Wei that Amara felt the absence viscerally. Wei who'd written Amara one message Year 0, Day 180. Wei who'd died four years ago never meeting her but teaching her sister and niece and transforming both their lives.

Amara brought tea. Sat across from Maya. The table that had been just hers and David's for three years now had family around it. The expansion felt strange. Good strange.

The lights flickered. Brief. Then steady again. Somewhere in the building's infrastructure, something struggling. The heating system groaned—metal expanding, contracting, protesting the endless Antarctic cold. Reminders that this place was hostile. That two million people survived here through engineering and will and the knowledge that location didn't matter anymore. Might as well be here as anywhere.

"Thank you," Maya said. Held the cup in both hands. Breathed in the steam. "Mint. From the garden. We brought seeds too. Kofi wants to plant them."

"Where?"

"Anywhere. He's determined. Says Wei's garden should keep growing even here." Maya smiled slightly. "He's optimistic. I love that about him."

"You're close. You and Kofi."

"He's my brother. I taught him to read. Taught him about death. Taught him meditation." Maya's voice was steady. Matter-of-fact. No melodrama. Just: truth. "We'll die together. He'll die first. Three months before me. That's—" She stopped. "That's true. So we're close."

Amara didn't know what to say. The casual way Maya spoke about her own death, her brother's death. Like discussing weather. Not dissociation—presence. Being with the truth without drowning in it.

"Does it help?" Amara asked. "The practice? The meditation?"

Maya considered. Took a sip of tea. "Doesn't make dying okay. Makes being present to dying possible. Different things." She paused. "Wei used to say: 'You can't stop the flower from wilting. But you can notice it while it blooms.' I didn't understand for months. Kept trying to figure out the metaphor. Then one day I was just—there. With a flower. Watching it. And I got it. Not the idea. The thing itself."

"That's what Zara said. What Professor Wei taught."

"Did you ever meet her? Wei?"

"No. She died before I—" Amara paused. Before I stopped being numb. Before I could meet anyone. "Before I came to Lagos properly."

"She would have liked you. Would have seen you. The way you calculate everything. Would have said something about bringing precision to impermanence." Maya's eyes were serious. "She left you a letter. Mama has it. Written Year 10 before Wei knew she'd die naturally. Instructions to open it—" Maya stopped. "Actually, I don't know when. When you need it, maybe."

A letter from a woman she'd never met who'd transformed her sister and niece. Amara filed that information away. Something to ask Zara about. Later. When ninety days seemed less impossible.

"I'm scared," Amara said. The words came without permission. "Of wasting this. Of being the wrong version of myself. Of—" She stopped. Tried to find words. "Of not knowing how to be an aunt. I've seen you six times. Kofi six times. That's not family. That's strangers with DNA connection."

Maya absorbed this. Didn't rush to reassure. Just: considered it. "Uncle Kenji saw me four times before he came to Lagos and actually taught me. Sometimes it takes time. We have ninety days. That's not much. But it's what we have."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

The truth of it settled between them. Had to be enough. Was all there was. The physics of limited time.

They drank tea in silence. Comfortable silence. Not awkward. Just: two people being present to early morning, to insomnia, to the fact of family assembled at the end of the world.

"Can I ask you something?" Maya said finally.


"Yes."

"The asteroid. The calculations. The detection." Maya's voice was careful. "You were the first to know. First to see the data. What was that like?"

Amara's hands tightened on her cup. Year 0, Day 1, 3:47 AM. Fifteen years ago exactly this hour. Sitting at her workstation. Watching the impact probability climb. Understanding everyone would die.

"The initial orbital elements showed—" Amara stopped. Heard herself. Started again. "I mean. It was—" But the numbers were safer. The technical details. "The impact probability climbed from sixty-three percent to ninety-nine point nine-seven percent over four hours of tracking. The trajectory was—"

"Aunt Amara." Maya's voice, gentle. Not cruel. Just—noticing. "You're doing it again."

"Doing what?"

"Calculating instead of feeling. Hiding in the data."

Amara stopped. Breath caught. Because Maya was right. She'd felt the question—the memory of 3:47 AM, the weight of being first to know—and immediately retreated into orbital mechanics. Armor made of numbers.

"I—" Her voice shook. "It's easier. The numbers. The precision. If I just describe the data, I don't have to—"

"Feel what it cost you."

"Yes."

Maya waited. Didn't push. Just: present. Holding space for Amara to choose.

Amara set down her cup. Pressed her hands flat on the table. Felt the surface. Solid. Real. Here.

"It was—" She tried again. Not the data this time. The experience. "Terrifying. I sat there watching the numbers and understanding everyone would die. My sister. Future nieces and nephews I'd never meet. David. Everyone I'd ever known. And me. And I—" Her throat closed. "I told them. Sent the alert. Went to Elena's office at 7 AM and said 'We have fifteen years.' And then I went home and I stopped being able to feel anything. Just—turned off. For seven years."

"But you turned back on."

"Your mother helped. Year 7. I called her. First time in seven years. She answered. She let me try again. She—" Amara's voice cracked. "She saved me. Pulled me back from the edge. Gave me permission to feel again even though feeling hurt."

Maya nodded. "That's Mama. She's fierce about life. About presence. Learned it from Wei. Taught it to me. Now I teach it to others." She smiled slightly. "The transmission continues. Until it doesn't."

"Do you resent her? For having you? For bringing you into this?"

"I used to think I would. When I was younger. But—" Maya considered. "My thirteenth birthday. Week after Wei died. I was so angry. Screaming at Mama: 'Why did you have me? Why did you bring me here to die young?' And she just sat there. Let me rage. Then said: 'Because I wanted to know you.' Not 'because life is precious' or any of that. Just—she wanted to know me. However long that was." Maya's voice caught. "I'm seventeen now. Four years of knowing her knowing me. That's—that's real. That happened. Brief doesn't mean it didn't matter."

Seventeen years old and speaking like a philosopher. Like Wei. Like someone who'd spent years practicing presence to impermanence. Amara felt pride and grief tangled together. Maya was remarkable. Would have been remarkable given eight decades. Was remarkable given seventeen years.

Would die in ninety days.

"I'm glad you're here," Amara said. Inadequate words. True words. "I'm glad I didn't waste all fifteen years alone."

"Me too." Maya finished her tea. Stood. "I should try to sleep. Tomorrow Kofi will be everywhere. He'll want to explore. See everything. Talk to everyone. You'll meet the real Kofi tomorrow."

"Looking forward to it."

"Liar." Maya smiled. "But that's okay. He's overwhelming. You'll adjust."

She moved toward the bedroom. Stopped at the door. Turned back.

"Aunt Amara? Thank you for being here. For choosing family. Mama says it was hard for you. Says you had to learn how to feel again. That's—" Maya searched for words. "That's courage. Choosing to feel when you could stay numb. Thank you."

Then she was gone. Door closing softly. Leaving Amara alone in the kitchenette with empty tea cups and the weight of being seen.

Choosing to feel. Was it courage or just: necessity? Amara didn't know. But Maya saw it as courage. Her seventeen-year-old niece who faced death with more presence than Amara had managed in sixty-three years—she called it courage.

Maybe it was.

Amara rinsed the cups. Returned them to the shelf. Moved to the window. Outside: Antarctic megacity stretching to horizon. Lights everywhere despite the early hour. Two million people still here. Two million choosing this place, this ending, this convergence.

Somewhere out there: Elena. Her office-mate from fifteen years ago when Amara had been director-equivalent and Elena had been mayor-elect. Both their careers ended now. Elena just: witness. Amara just: aunt.

Somewhere: Kenji. Zara's younger brother. Teaching presence to hundreds. Wei's lineage spreading. The practice continuing until it couldn't.

Somewhere: Ibrahim. David's work colleague. Former fighter. Learning presence through maintaining arrays. Through being here.

Two million stories. Two million people with ninety days left. Everyone choosing how to spend them.

Amara chose family.

She returned to bed. David still sleeping. She settled beside him carefully. His warmth. His presence. His choice to leave Platform 73 and 47B to be here with her. Thirteen years maintaining arrays. Three years in Lagos. Now: ninety days together watching their family face the end.

She closed her eyes. Didn't sleep. Just: lay there. Feeling David breathe beside her. Hearing Kofi's occasional sleep-sounds through the wall. Knowing Zara and Kwame were twenty feet away on the couch. Knowing Maya was probably still awake, meditating or practicing or whatever she did at 4 AM when the world pressed too heavy.

Family. Here. Together. Ninety days.

Amara counted the days. Not hours anymore. Not minutes. Just: ninety days. Fifteen years ago she'd detected the asteroid. Calculated everyone's death. Become the bearer of extinction.

Now: she was just Amara. Aunt. Sister. Partner. Human trying to be present.

The numbers still whispered. Old habits die hard. But this morning—lying here beside David, family in the next room—she could set them aside. Not forever. Just: now.

By 6:00 AM, sound returned. Kofi's voice first—loud, excited, immediate: "Maya! Maya, wake up! It's Antarctica! Let's go see everything!"

Maya's reply, muffled but audible: "It's six in the morning."

"Exactly! We're wasting daylight! Well, not daylight. It's dark. But we're wasting darkness! Come on!"

Zara's voice from the living room: "Kofi, let your sister sleep."

"She's been awake since three," Kofi said matter-of-factly. "I heard her and Aunt Amara talking. Maya's bad at sleeping. I'm good at it. I can sleep anywhere! Yesterday I slept in the transport! Want to see my mint plant? I'm going to plant it today. Uncle David, are you awake? Can you help me find dirt?"

David stirred beside Amara. Opened his eyes. Smiled. "Guess we're up."

"Guess so."

They emerged from the bedroom. The apartment was transforming. Kofi had somehow unpacked half his bag—clothes scattered, the mint plant on the windowsill, various objects Amara couldn't identify. Maya sat at the table with another cup of tea, hair uncombed, looking exhausted and present. Zara and Kwame were folding the couch back, organizing bags, trying to create order from chaos.

"Good morning," Zara said. Her eyes met Amara's. Question in them: How are you? Is this okay? Are we too much?

Amara smiled. Tried to communicate: This is good. This is right. You're not too much.

Zara smiled back. Understood.

"Aunt Amara!" Kofi bounded over. "David says there's a community center. Can we go? I want to see everything! Are there other kids? Maya says Uncle Kenji teaches there. Can I meet him? And Grandma Elena! I've only seen her twice! And—"

"Kofi." Kwame's voice, gentle but firm. "Breathe. Aunt Amara and Uncle David just woke up."

"But I have so much energy! The transport was so long! Four hours sitting! I need to move!"

David laughed. "Come on. I'll show you the building. Community center is three blocks over. We can walk there. Let these four have breakfast quietly."

"Really?" Kofi's face lit up. "Maya, we're going exploring!"

"You go." Maya didn't move. "I'll stay. Help with breakfast."

"You sure?"

"I'm sure. I'll explore later. Slower. You explore fast."

Kofi accepted this instantly. "Okay! Uncle David, let's go! Is it cold? Should I wear a jacket? Do you have penguins here? I know it's not that kind of Antarctica but maybe some penguins?"

They left. Kofi's voice echoing in the hallway, David's quieter responses, both fading. The apartment suddenly quieter.

Kwame moved to the kitchenette. "I'll cook. You three sit. Talk. You haven't had time alone in—years."

"You're sure?" Zara asked.

"I'm sure. Go. Be sisters. I'll make actual breakfast. Not synth-protein."

So they sat. Amara, Zara, Maya. Three generations. Three relationships.

Zara spoke first. "Thank you for making space. For having us. I know it's small. We can look for other housing if—"

"No." Amara interrupted. "This is good. I want you here. Want—" She gestured vaguely. "Want family. Even if I'm not good at it."

"You're doing fine," Zara said gently. "Better than fine. You're here. That's what matters."

Maya looked between them. "Can I ask something?"

"Yes," both sisters said simultaneously.

"What was it like? When you were kids? Before everything. Before detection. Before—" She gestured. "When you were just sisters?"

Zara and Amara exchanged glances. The past. Their childhood. Mumbai. Parents. Being young when the world had future tense.

"We were close," Zara said finally. "Best friends. Amara was older. Protective. Brilliant even then. She helped me with homework. Taught me science. Made me curious about how things worked."

"Then?" Maya prompted.

"Then we grew up. Got careers. Moved to different continents. Drifted." Zara's voice was sad. "Not dramatically. Just—gradually. Work took priority. Distance took priority. Then the asteroid. Then—"

"Then I disappeared," Amara finished. "Seven years. Your mother kept trying. I kept hiding."

"But you came back," Maya said. "Year 7. Year 8. You chose to try again."

"Your mother let me try again," Amara corrected.

"We both chose," Zara said firmly. "I chose to answer the phone. You chose to call. We both chose repair over resentment. That's—" She stopped. Tears forming. "That's what I want you to see, Maya. Relationships can break. Can heal. Require choosing every day. Your aunt and I lost seven years. We're not wasting these ninety days."

Maya absorbed this. Nodded. "Good. Because I want to know you both. Not as separate aunts and mothers. As sisters. As people who chose each other despite everything."

"We chose you too," Amara said quietly. "Both of you. Kofi and Maya. We chose family. Chose presence. Chose—" She couldn't finish.

Maya reached across the table. Took Amara's hand. Took Zara's hand. Connected them.

"Ninety days," she said. "Let's be here for all of them. Fully here. Present. Together. That's enough. That has to be enough."

Amara looked at her niece—seventeen years, three months old, wise beyond her years, practicing presence while dying young. Looked at her sister—fifty-three years old, choosing life despite death, fierce and tender simultaneously.

Family. Here. Real.

"Yes," Amara whispered. "That's enough."

Kwame brought breakfast—actual eggs somehow, real eggs, impossibly expensive. "Saved them for today. Special occasion. First morning together."

They ate. Talked about nothing important. Kofi's energy. Maya's insomnia. The apartment's quirks. David's terrible jokes. Zara's engineering schematics still organized obsessively. Amara's inability to keep plants alive.

Normal family conversation. Ordinary. Precious. Temporary.

Outside the window: Antarctic dawn arriving slowly. Winter sun weak but present. The megacity waking. Two million people beginning another day.

Ninety days left. Amara felt the number without calculating it. Not 2,160 hours. Not 129,600 minutes. Just: ninety days. The counting that had defined her life for fifteen years loosening its grip.

This moment. This breakfast. This family. This presence.

The calculation could wait.

She was here now. Finally, completely, impossibly here.

With family. With love. With ninety days.

It wasn't enough.

It was everything.
