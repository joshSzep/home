# Chapter: Last Office

**Elena Torres | Year 15, Month 3, Day 19 | Antarctica, Administration Complex**

---

The last constituent petition arrives at 7:14 AM.

Elena reads it on her tablet—habit from fifteen years of governance. The handwriting is careful, elderly, written on actual paper then scanned:

*Mayor Torres,*

*My name is Yolanda Chen. I am 87 years old. I have lived in Antarctica for nine years, since my children died in the Mumbai crisis. I have no family left. No friends close enough to die with. I am writing to ask: is there somewhere I should go? Is there a place for people who will be alone at the end? I don't want to die alone. But I don't know who to ask.*

*Yolanda Chen, Building 14, Unit 3421*

Elena sets the tablet down. Through her office window: Antarctica's morning light, soft grey, the megacity stretching in all directions. Twelve days until impact. 1.1 million people still here. Some with family. Some with chosen communities. Some—like Yolanda Chen—with no one.

Marcus Rivera knocks. Enters. Deputy mayor for thirteen years, since the Year 2 election that nearly unseated her. He's aged well—sixty now, silver at his temples, the fierce ambition of his youth softened into something more patient.

"Morning briefing when you're ready," he says. "Though there's not much to brief."

"There's a woman in Building 14. Yolanda Chen. Eighty-seven. Alone."

Marcus waits.

"She wrote to ask if there's a place to not die alone."

His expression shifts. Sadness, but not surprise. They've governed this megacity for fifteen years. Nothing surprises either of them anymore.

"The companion matching program," he says. "We started it Month 1."

"She didn't know about it."

"Then we tell her. Personal outreach. Someone visits today."

Elena nods. This is governance now. Not policy. Not crisis management. Just: noticing who falls through cracks. Making sure fewer people die alone. Twelve days of making sure.

"The briefing can wait," she says. "Walk with me first."

---

They walk through the Administration Complex. Elena has walked these halls for fifteen years—first as emergency coordinator, then as mayor, then as whatever she is now. Something beyond governance. Witness. Holder of space. The person who shows up because someone has to.

Staff greet her as she passes. Fewer staff now—most have taken leave for final weeks, choosing family over duty. But some stay. Marcus stays. The essential services team stays. People who find meaning in maintenance, in keeping systems running until they can't.

"Reyes wrote," Elena says. "Arrives today."

Marcus nods. "I saw. Afternoon transport."

Marcus Reyes. Her first assistant. Left Year 2 for Mumbai to teach refugee children. Thirteen years of correspondence, quarterly letters, occasional video calls. Coming home now for the end. Two Marcuses in her life—Reyes who left, Rivera who stayed. Both necessary. Both loved in different ways.

"He's bringing three students," Marcus says. "Children he taught for a decade. Didn't want to leave them behind."

"Good. They can stay in Building 7. The empty units."

"Already arranged."

Of course already arranged. Marcus Rivera anticipates everything. Has for thirteen years.

They reach the observation deck. Antarctica spreads below—the megacity humanity built when climate collapsed, when Earth's temperate zones became uninhabitable, when four billion people migrated south. Elena remembers Year -4, before the asteroid. The rush to build. The desperation. The impossible scaling of infrastructure. Now: functioning but frozen. A city that works. A city that will work for twelve more days.

"Do you remember," Elena says, "the Year 2 election? When you ran against me?"

Marcus laughs softly. "How could I forget? You demolished me."

"You had good ideas. Radical, but good. I was too cautious to implement them."

"You were cautious because caution saved lives. My ideas would have caused riots."

"Maybe. Or maybe they would have helped."

They stand together at the railing. Below, the morning population moves—transports, pedestrians, the ordinary flow of a million lives. Twelve days from extinction and still people go to work, visit family, maintain routines. Not denial. Just: life continuing until it can't.

"I've been thinking about Daniel Okonkwo," Elena says.

Marcus is silent. They've discussed this many times since Daniel's suicide five months ago. The man who killed his friend over food during the Year 2 riot. The sentence Elena refused to commute despite advocacy from both Marcuses.

"If I'd pardoned him. Year 3, Year 4, Year 6. Would he have lived? Would he have found peace?"

"You can't know that."

"No. But I chose justice over mercy. And he died anyway. Consumed by guilt I helped preserve."

Marcus turns to face her. "Elena. You made the call you believed was right. He killed a man. The victim's widow never forgave him. Justice wasn't wrong."

"Justice wasn't wrong. But mercy might have been wiser."

Twelve days to carry this understanding. Twelve days of knowing she chose institutional consequence over human compassion. It doesn't change anything. The past is fixed. But she's allowed to see it clearly now.

---

The morning briefing is brief. Status reports: power, water, food distribution, medical services. Everything functioning. Twelve days of function remaining.

"Communication requests," Marcus reads from his tablet. "Fourteen media outlets want final interviews. Historical documentation."

"Decline. My words are already recorded. Fifteen years of speeches. Enough legacy."

"Community relations flagged seventeen interpersonal conflicts. Disputes over space, resources, burial preferences."

"Status of resolution?"

"Fifteen resolved through mediation. Two escalated to formal hearing."

"Hearings still running?"

"Abbreviated process. Forty-eight hour resolution. Both parties agreed."

Elena nods. Governance persists. Even at the end. Especially at the end. Humans in community need systems to navigate disagreement. Twelve days isn't long enough to abandon structure.

"Personal requests," Marcus continues. "Forty-three people asked to meet with you before the end."

"Time?"

"I've blocked morning hours for the next five days. Twenty-minute sessions. Decline the rest, or extend to ten days?"

Elena considers. Forty-three people want to talk to their mayor before dying. Some will want to say thank you. Some will want to complain. Some will just want to be seen—witnessed by someone whose title carries weight.

"Ten days. Extend the blocks to all hours. Sleep isn't essential anymore."

Marcus makes a note. "Self-care reminder: your physician flagged—"

"Marcus."

He stops. Meets her eyes.

"I'm seventy-three years old. I'm dying in twelve days. I don't need a physician to tell me what I already know. What I need is to spend my last twelve days being useful. That means meeting anyone who wants to be seen. Understood?"

His expression softens. He nods. "Understood."

Yolanda Chen arrives at 11 AM.

She's smaller than Elena imagined—thin, white-haired, walking with the careful deliberation of someone whose joints no longer cooperate. Building 14 is three kilometers away. She walked the entire distance.

"Mayor Torres." Her voice is stronger than her frame suggests. "I didn't expect you to respond personally."

"I wanted to meet you. Please, sit."

They sit in Elena's office—the same office she's occupied for fifteen years. Photos on the walls: her son Kenji at various ages. Her late husband Jorge. Staff photos from different eras. The visual record of a life spent in service.

"Your letter moved me," Elena says. "The question you asked—about having somewhere to go—it's the right question. Too many people don't know to ask it."

Yolanda's eyes are bright, intelligent. "I've been alone for years. My husband, my children, my grandchildren—all gone to the Mumbai crisis. I stayed because Antarctica was functioning. Somewhere to exist. But existing alone isn't the same as living with others."

"No. It isn't."

"I thought about dying alone. Making peace with it. But I couldn't. I kept thinking: there must be others like me. Others without family, without community. There should be a place for us to find each other."

Elena nods. "There is. We started a companion matching program Month 1. People without family paired with others in the same situation. Some become friends. Some just become... witnesses for each other. Present together when the end comes."

Yolanda's expression shifts. Hope, perhaps. Or relief.

"I didn't know."

"We should have reached you earlier. That's our failure. But we can correct it now. Today, if you're willing, someone from the program will visit. Connect you with others. Help you find community for the final twelve days."

"Twelve days." Yolanda's voice catches. "It's not very long."

"No. But it's enough to not be alone. If you choose."

---

Afternoon. Marcus Reyes arrives on the 2:15 transport.

Elena watches from the arrivals platform. He emerges surrounded by three children—teenagers now, she supposes. A boy and two girls, ages thirteen to sixteen. The children he chose over returning earlier. The children he wouldn't leave behind.

He looks older. Fifty-five now, greying temples, lines around his eyes. But the same gentle attentiveness she remembers. The same quality of presence that made him excellent at his job.

"Mayor Torres." He smiles. Uses her title the way he always did—formal but warm.

"Marcus." She embraces him. First physical contact in thirteen years. He still smells the same—ink and clean linen and something indefinably *him*. "Welcome home."

"Home." He looks around at the Antarctic infrastructure. "I left when this was emergency housing. Now it's a city."

"A dying city. But yes. A city."

The children hang back—shy, uncertain. Refugees' wariness. Marcus gestures them forward.

"Mayor Torres, this is Jin, Priya, and Tomás. I've taught them for ten years. They're family now."

Elena greets each one. Jin, the eldest, meets her eyes directly. "Mr. Reyes said you're the best leader he ever worked for."

"Mr. Reyes is generous. I was difficult to work for. Demanding. Impatient."

"He said that too. He said difficult is sometimes what leadership requires."

Elena laughs. First real laugh in days. "He would say that."

They walk together toward Building 7. Marcus falls into step beside her, the children trailing. Natural rhythm—assistant and principal, even after thirteen years apart.

"How is he?" Marcus asks. "Kenji."

"Teaching. Found his practice. Found his purpose. You'll see him tonight—he wants to meet you."

"And you?"

Elena considers. How is she? Seventy-three, twelve days from death, carrying the weight of fifteen years of impossible choices. How does anyone answer that question?

"I'm finishing," she says. "The work is nearly done. The witnessing continues. I'm trying to leave well."

"That's enough."

"Has to be."

---

Evening. Elena's apartment.

Kenji arrives for dinner—the first time she's cooked for him in months. He's been too busy with teaching, she's been too consumed by governance. But tonight: just family. Just mother and son and the people they've gathered.

Marcus Reyes brings the children. Marcus Rivera comes alone—his wife died Year 6, his children scattered across the megacity with their own families. But he comes. Family isn't only blood.

They eat together—seven people around a table meant for four. Rice, vegetables, the last of the fresh fish from the aquaculture facilities. Simple food. Good food. The meal as communion.

"Tell me about Mumbai," Kenji says to Marcus Reyes. "Thirteen years. What did you learn?"

Marcus sets down his fork. Considers.

"I learned that teaching isn't about content. It's about presence. Jin, Priya, Tomás—they learned English, math, science. But what they really learned was that someone showed up every day. Someone kept showing up even when things fell apart. That's what I taught them. That's what they taught me."

Jin nods. "He never missed a day. Even during the Year 8 plague. He wore a mask and came anyway."

"I was terrified," Marcus admits. "But presence isn't about not being afraid. It's about showing up afraid."

Kenji smiles. Elena recognizes the expression—her son seeing his own teaching reflected in someone else's practice.

"That's what Mother taught me," Kenji says. "Without using those words. She governed this city for fifteen years. Showed up every day. Even when it was impossible. Especially when it was impossible."

Elena's throat tightens. Her son, seeing her. Understanding her. After forty-two years and infinite distance, finally seeing.

"I didn't know what I was teaching," she says. "I was just doing the work."

"That's the best teaching. The kind that doesn't know it's teaching."

---

Night. The apartment quiet.

Elena sits alone on the balcony. Antarctica stretches below—lights against darkness, a million lives humming. Twelve days. Eleven, really, since midnight approaches.

Marcus Reyes finds her. Sits beside her.

"The children are asleep," he says. "Jin asked if we could visit the observation tower tomorrow. See the whole city from above."

"I'll arrange it."

They sit in comfortable silence. Thirteen years apart, but the rhythm remains. The ease of people who've worked closely, seen each other truly.

"I never thanked you," Elena says. "For leaving. For choosing Mumbai. For showing me that departure can be its own form of service."

"You didn't need to thank me. You understood."

"I understood after. Years after. At first I felt abandoned."

"I know. Your letters were... measured. For the first two years."

She laughs softly. "I was hurt. But I kept writing."

"That's the difference between you and most people. You kept writing even when you were hurt. You kept showing up."

"Kenji's teaching word for it. Presence."

"Before Kenji had a word for it, you were doing it. Modeling it. Every day."

They watch the city together. The lights against the dark. The life that persists even as extinction approaches.

"Twelve days," Marcus says.

"Eleven and a half."

"Are you ready?"

Elena considers. Ready is a strange word. Fifteen years of preparation for something that can't be prepared for. Fifty-eight years of governance, of public service, of showing up because someone had to. Now: nearly done.

"I'm ready to rest," she says. "Ready for the showing up to end. Ready to just... be. For whatever time remains."

"That sounds like readiness."

"Maybe. Or maybe it's just exhaustion."

"Same thing sometimes."

They sit until the cold drives them inside. Elena to her empty bed—empty for years, since Jorge died. Marcus to the couch, the children distributed across the floor on borrowed mattresses.

Tomorrow: more meetings. More witnesses. More presence.

Eleven days of presence remaining.

Enough to finish.

Enough.
