# Chapter 47: Seventeen

**Maya Okafor-Mensah | Year 15, Month 1 | Antarctica**

---

Maya can't sleep.

Third night in Antarctica and the strangeness hasn't worn off. She lies in the top bunk listening to Kofi breathe below her—steady, deep, the sleep of someone still young enough to rest despite everything. Three months from now, no more breath sounds. No more Kofi.

The math comes automatically. Seventeen years, four months old. Three months remaining.

She'll never be eighteen.

Maya sits up carefully, trying not to wake her brother. The room is dark except for the faint glow from the heating vent—red light pulsing, the building's infrastructure groaning as it fights Antarctic cold. Through the small window she can see lights from other buildings. Two million people gathered here. Everyone who chose to die together. Or at least to be witnessed.

She climbs down quietly. Kofi doesn't stir. His face is peaceful, mouth slightly open, completely himself even in sleep. In three months that face will be gone. That specific expression—the one that's purely Kofi, purely her brother—will be vaporized alongside everything else.

The anticipatory grief rises. She's carried it seventeen years. Grew up knowing exactly when she'd die. But knowing and experiencing are different. This apartment, this city, these final three months—this is experiencing. This is the countdown made visceral.

Maya pulls on her jacket—the one Mama insisted she bring despite Lagos never needing it. Moves through the dark apartment. Living room: Mama and Papa on the fold-out couch, Papa's arm around Mama even in sleep. Nineteen years married. Two children they chose to bring into a dying world. Still here. Still choosing each other.

The front door opens silently. Antarctic air hits her face—sharp, cold, alive. She steps outside.

---

Midnight in Antarctica.

The polar night is absolute. No sun for months at this latitude, this season. Just: darkness and stars and the artificial lights of human settlement. Maya stands on the walkway outside Building 14, looking up.

The stars are brilliant.

More stars than she's ever seen. Lagos District had engineered sky, light pollution, the filtered atmosphere of manufactured tropics. Here: raw. Unfiltered. Every star visible, the Milky Way a river of light overhead. The asteroid is up there somewhere. 2031 KZ₄. Forty-seven kilometers wide, approaching at twenty-three kilometers per second. In three months it impacts the Pacific Ocean. In three months these stars continue, indifferent to the consciousness that briefly witnessed them.

Maya breathes the cold air. Feels her lungs contract, her body protest the temperature. Alive. Responding. Here.

She's standing in the place where the world will end.

This thought should terrify her. Does terrify her. But also: clarifies. She practiced two years, eight months. Learned presence through Wei's teaching transmitted by Mama, by Uncle Kenji. Learned to be with fear instead of consumed by it. Learned that dying at seventeen isn't okay but being present until then is possible.

Three months.

What does she want from three months?

Not: miracle. The physics is certain. Death is guaranteed.

Not: meaning that makes dying at seventeen acceptable. It's not acceptable. Will never be acceptable. She's furious about it. Rage lives in her chest alongside the practice, alongside the love. Both true. Both present. Both real.

What she wants is simpler: presence. Knowing family. Especially Aunt Amara—six meetings total in seventeen years isn't enough. Learning from Uncle David about maintenance, about showing up. Hearing Uncle Kenji teach everything Wei taught him. Being with Kofi until he dies, then being with everyone else until she dies. Not alone.

And she wants to learn. Everything. Intensively. Uncle Kenji studied with Wei for three years. Maya has three months. Not enough time. Exactly the time there is.

Tomorrow she'll ask him. Daily sessions. One-on-one. Everything Wei taught. Not because it will make her ready—she'll never be ready. Because being awake until the end is better than being asleep.

A door opens behind her. Footsteps approach. Maya turns.

Aunt Amara, wearing too many layers, looking uncomfortable in the cold. Sixty-three years old. Nine years of reconnection after seven years of isolation. Family who's barely family but trying to be.

"Can't sleep either?" Amara asks quietly.

"Strange bed. Strange place."

Amara joins her at the railing. "I've lived here eight years. Still feels alien sometimes. This isn't home. Lagos was home. But Lagos is empty now. Everyone came here to die together."

Maya looks at her aunt. Really looks. Sees the scientist who calculated everyone's death at 3:47 AM fifteen years ago and then went numb for seven years. Sees the person who chose to feel again, who reconnected with Mama, who's here now.

"Mama says you had to learn how to feel again."

Amara is quiet. Then: "Staying numb was easier. But your mother called me Year 7. I answered. She gave me permission to try again. So I did."

"I'm angry," Maya says. "About dying young. About Kofi dying younger. About never being eighteen. I practice presence but I'm also furious. Both. All the time."

"Good. You should be. Being angry and being present—those aren't opposites."

"Wei taught that. Mama teaches it. Uncle Kenji teaches it. Paradox: both things true."

"Do you believe that? That seventeen years is complete?"

Maya considers the question. The stars overhead. The cold air. Her brother sleeping inside. Three months remaining.

"I don't know," she says honestly. "Wei said the butterfly blooms for three days and that's complete. But butterflies don't know they're butterflies. Don't know they're dying. I know. I've always known. Does that make it different?"

"Maybe. Or maybe knowing makes the blooming more intentional. You've practiced two years, eight months. Kofi practices because you taught him. You taught those girls in Lagos—Chidinma and Amara. You taught Samuel. You're teaching even while dying. That's—" Amara pauses. "That's transmission. Wei to your mother to you to others. The teaching spreading until there's no one left to teach. But while there are people: you teach."

"For three months."

"For three months."

They stand quietly. The megacity hums around them—two million people in buildings designed for four billion, infrastructure barely maintained, everyone waiting for the same ending. Somewhere Uncle Kenji is teaching presence practice. Grandmother Elena is bearing witness as she's done for seventeen years. Uncle David is probably checking solar arrays even at midnight because that's what he does. Everyone showing up. Everyone present. Everyone facing it together.

"Aunt Amara," Maya says. "Can I ask you something?"

"Always."

"The detection. Year 0, Day 1, 3:47 AM. You were first to know. First to see the data. What was that like?"

Amara stiffens. Maya can feel the retreat—the instinct to hide in calculations, in orbital mechanics, in the safety of numbers. But then Amara breathes. Chooses. Stays present.

"Terrifying," Amara says. Voice quiet but real. "I sat there watching the impact probability climb and understanding everyone would die. Including you and Kofi who didn't exist yet but would exist and would die young. I told them. Sent the alert. Went to Elena's office and said 'We have fifteen years.' Then I went home and stopped being able to feel anything for seven years."

"But you turned back on."

"Your mother helped. She saved me. Pulled me back. Gave me permission to feel even though feeling hurt."

"Does it still hurt?"

"Every moment. But hurt is better than numbness. Grief is better than absence. Being here with you right now—cold and scared and three months from dying—is better than seven years of not feeling anything."

Maya understands. The practice didn't take away pain. Just taught her to be present to it. Fear doesn't dissolve. You just learn to breathe with it. Grief doesn't end. You just carry it while also carrying love.

"I'm glad you're here," Maya says. "I'm glad I get to know you. Even if it's only three months. Even if six meetings before this wasn't enough. I'm glad you came back."

"Me too." Amara wipes her eyes. "I wasted seven years. Then wasted another year being cautious. But the last seven years—reconnecting with your mother, visiting Lagos, meeting you and Kofi properly—those years mattered. Those years were real. Brief doesn't mean they didn't count."

"Brief doesn't mean incomplete," Maya says. Wei's teaching. The butterfly blooming. Three days or seventeen years—the measure isn't duration. The measure is presence.

"You sound like your grandmother Wei."

"I never met her. But she taught Mama. Mama taught me. Uncle Kenji learned from Wei directly. Now he teaches others. The transmission continues. Until it can't. But right now: it does."

Amara looks at her niece—seventeen years, four months old, three months from death, more whole than most people who lived full lives. "Are you ready? For three months? For the end?"

"No." Maya doesn't hesitate. "I'll never be ready. Ready implies some threshold where death becomes okay. That's not real. I'll die terrified. But I'll die awake. Present. Seeing it clearly. Loving what I'm losing even while losing it. That's all I can do. That's all anyone can do."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

The answer settles between them. Not comfort. Not solution. Just: truth. Three months of truth. Then physics.

"We should sleep," Amara says. "Kofi will be chaos tomorrow. He'll want to explore, meet everyone, see everything. You'll need energy."

Maya smiles despite everything. "He wants to plant mint from Wei's garden. In Antarctica. He's determined."

"Then we'll help him plant it. Three months of mint growing. Then: vaporized. But those three months—the mint will be alive. That matters."

"Everything temporary."

"Everything here."

They turn back toward the building. The cold has seeped through Maya's jacket. Her hands are numb. Her face hurts. But she's felt it. Been present to it. Witnessed this moment. Midnight in Antarctica. Her aunt beside her under brilliant stars.

At the door, Maya pauses. Looks back at the stars once more.

Seventeen years, four months of seeing stars. Three more months. Then: nothing.

But tonight: everything.

---

Morning arrives with Kofi's energy.

Maya wakes to him bouncing on the bottom bunk, whispering loudly: "Maya! Maya! It's morning! I can see the city! There are buildings everywhere! Can we explore? Can we meet people? Can we find Uncle Kenji? Can we—"

"Kofi." Maya's voice is rough with sleep. "What time is it?"

"Six thirty! Everyone's still sleeping but I can't sleep anymore! This place is amazing! Did you see the stars last night? I looked out the window and there were so many stars! More than Lagos! And it's so cold! I've never been this cold! And—"

"Kofi. Breathe."

He breathes. Grins up at her. Fourteen years, three months old. Pure joy despite everything. Despite three months. Despite dying before he's fifteen. Just: here. Present. Alive.

Maya climbs down. Hugs him. Feels his aliveness—the warmth, the energy, the pure Kofi-ness that will be gone in ninety days. The grief rises. She holds him tighter.

"You okay?" he asks, muffled against her shoulder.

"Yeah. Just—glad you're my brother."

"I'm glad you're my sister." He pulls back, looks at her seriously. "Three months. That's what you said in the garden. Three months until impact."

"Yes."

"Are you scared?"

"Terrified."

"Me too." He sits on the bottom bunk. The energy dims but doesn't disappear. "I practiced last night. Like you taught me. Breath counting. Got to twenty-three before I lost track. That's my record."

"That's good."

"Is it enough? For three months? For—when it happens?"

Maya sits beside him. Her baby brother who she raised, who she taught to read and practice and face death consciously. "I don't know. I've practiced two years, eight months. I'm still scared. But practice means I'm scared AND present. Not hiding from it. Not pretending. Just—with it. That's different."

"Different how?"

"I see clearly. I love clearly. I grieve clearly. Everything's sharp instead of numb. Is that better? I don't know. But it's realer."

Kofi nods slowly. Processing. His face has that concentrated expression—the one that means he's trying to understand something hard. "Will you keep teaching me? For three months? Everything you know?"

"Yes. Every day. And Uncle Kenji will teach both of us. He studied with Wei for three years. He knows more than I do."

"But you know me. You know how I think. So you can teach me your way and Uncle Kenji can teach me his way and maybe together it'll be enough."

Maya feels tears threaten. He's so young. So honest. So present despite everything. "It'll be enough. We'll practice together. Until we can't. That's all anyone gets. But three months of practicing together—that's real. That's something."

"Okay." Kofi's energy returns. "Can we get breakfast? I'm starving. And then can we explore? And find Uncle Kenji? And meet Grandma Elena? And see Uncle David's work? And—"

"Yes. All of it. But first: breakfast."

The apartment is waking. Mama emerging from the fold-out couch, hair wild, face soft with sleep. Papa starting coffee in the small kitchen. Aunt Amara and Uncle David moving quietly in their bedroom. Family. Together. Three months of this. Then: nothing.

But right now: everything.

---

Breakfast is crowded chaos.

Six people in a kitchenette designed for two. Kofi talking constantly—questions, observations, plans. Papa making synthetic eggs and real bread (somehow Uncle David has real bread, miracle of maintenance connections). Mama trying to organize their first day. Aunt Amara looking overwhelmed by the noise. Uncle David calm, steady, present to the chaos.

Maya watches it all. Memorizes it. The specific way Mama touches Papa's shoulder as she passes. The way Kofi gestures wildly while talking. The way Aunt Amara tries to hide her overwhelm behind competence. The way Uncle David just exists—quiet, solid, here.

Three months of mornings like this. Then: no more mornings. No more family. No more anything.

She's eating breakfast and grieving breakfast simultaneously. Present to both. The practice doesn't fix the grief. Just makes room for it alongside the love.

"Maya?" Mama's voice breaks through. "You're quiet. You okay, baby?"

"Yeah. Just—taking it in. Family. Together. It's good."

Mama's eyes glisten. She understands. They're all taking it in. All memorizing. All present to the preciousness and the loss simultaneously.

"Today's plan," Papa says, redirecting gently. "Kofi and I will explore the district. Find community center, meet people, understand the layout. Zara, you and Amara and David can catch up properly—I know you three need time. Maya—" He looks at her. "What do you want?"

What does she want?

To practice. To learn. To meet Uncle Kenji formally. To ask for the intensive training. To spend three months absorbing everything Wei taught through him. To die awake.

"I want to find Uncle Kenji," Maya says. "Meet him properly. We've only met four times before. I want to—" She searches for words. "I want to learn. Everything he knows. Everything Wei taught him. For three months."

Mama understands immediately. "He teaches at the community center. Daily sessions. Ten AM and three PM usually. We can go together."

"Can I come?" Kofi asks. "I want to learn too!"

"Of course, baby." Mama reaches for his hand. "We'll all go. Family learning together."

---

The walk to the community center takes fifteen minutes.

Maya experiences Antarctica fully for the first time in daylight—except there's no daylight. Still polar night. Just: artificial lights, the ambient glow of buildings, the strange twilight that passes for morning here.

The temperature is minus twenty-four Celsius. Her breath fogs. Her face hurts. Her hands are numb despite gloves. Everything is concrete and ice and engineered survival. Buildings stretching in every direction. Infrastructure groaning. Two million people maintaining civilization through will and habit and the simple choice to show up.

"This was four billion people at peak," Mama says quietly. "Year 0. Forever Earth. Humanity's bet on adaptation. Now—" She gestures at the sprawl. "Everyone who chose to die together. Or couldn't bear to die alone."

Maya sees it clearly. The buildings designed for massive population. The emptiness where crowds should be. The systems barely functioning. Everything temporary, everything failing, everything maintained just barely by people who know maintenance won't matter but do it anyway.

Like Uncle David and the solar arrays. Like Grandmother Elena and the governance. Like everyone who keeps showing up.

Presence as practice. Maintenance as meditation. Work that doesn't save anything but matters anyway.

The community center is a converted warehouse. Three stories, concrete, lights on inside. Through the windows Maya sees people gathering. Twenty, thirty, maybe more. Everyone coming to practice. Everyone learning to die awake.

"Kenji's inside," Mama says. "Setting up. We're early—session doesn't start until ten. But we can introduce you properly. If you want."

Maya breathes. Feels the cold air in her lungs. Feels her fear. Feels her intention.

She's seventeen years, four months old. She'll die in three months. Before death, she'll practice. She'll learn. She'll transmit what she learns to others. She'll die awake.

It isn't enough. It's all there is.

"I'm ready," Maya says.

She's not ready. Will never be ready. But she's here. Present. Choosing.

It isn't enough. It's all there is.

They enter the community center together. Family. Learning. Practicing. Present.

Until they can't be.

But right now: they are.

---

The room is simple.

Converted warehouse space, forty-eight square meters, concrete floor, windows on two sides showing the polar twilight. Thirty chairs arranged in a circle. No decorations. No elaborate setup. Just: space for practice.

Uncle Kenji is arranging cushions—thirty-seven years old, looks like Grandmother Elena, moves with the ease that comes from years of practice. He glances up when they enter. Sees Mama first. Smiles—real, warm, present.

"Zara. Good morning."

"Good morning, Kenji. We're early. Wanted to—" Mama gestures to Maya and Kofi. "Wanted you to meet my children properly. You've met them before but briefly. This is Maya. This is Kofi."

Kenji's attention shifts. Sees Maya. Really sees her—not analyzing, not categorizing, just: seeing. His presence is palpable. This is what Wei taught. This is Picture Six, Picture Seven, the ox ridden home, practice naturalized into being.

"Maya," Kenji says. "You've grown."

"People do that." The same words she said to Aunt Amara yesterday. Honest. Direct. Real.

Kenji smiles. "You sound like your grandmother Wei."

"I never met her. But she taught Mama. Mama taught me."

"The transmission continues." Kenji turns to Kofi. "And you're Kofi. The mint planter. The optimist."

Kofi grins. "You've heard about me?"

"Your mother writes. Your sister writes. You're famous in our family."

"I'm not famous. I'm just me."

"Just you is enough." Kenji gestures to the circle. "Sit. We have time before others arrive. Tell me—why are you here? What do you want from three months?"

The question is direct. Classic Wei-teaching—no small talk, no easing in. Just: the real question. The one that matters.

Maya sits. Kofi beside her, Mama beside him. The circle incomplete, chairs empty, waiting for others. But right now: family. Teacher and students. Presence to presence.

"I want to learn everything," Maya says. No hesitation. Complete honesty. "Wei taught you for three years. You've been teaching others for six years. I have three months. Not enough time. Exactly the time there is. I want daily sessions. One-on-one intensive. Everything you know about presence, about practice, about dying consciously. Not because it will make me ready—I'll never be ready. Because being awake is better than being asleep."

Kenji listens. Doesn't interrupt. Doesn't immediately respond. Just: receives. This is also teaching—holding space for truth without rushing to fix it.

Finally he speaks. "That's impossible. Wei's teaching took three years to absorb. I can't compress it into three months."

"So teach me anyway. Not to achieve compression. Just to transmit what you can. I'll absorb what I absorb. Let go of the rest. But I want to try."

"Why?"

The question isn't dismissive. It's precise. Why. What's the real intention. What's underneath the request.

Maya considers. Feels into the truth. "Because Wei died before I could learn directly from her. Because Mama gave me the basics but I want depth. Because I'm seventeen and dying and I want my brief life to mean something. Not mean to the universe—I know it doesn't matter cosmically. Mean to me. Mean I was present. Mean I tried. Mean I didn't waste the gift of consciousness by hiding from its ending."

Kenji's face softens. "Ah. There it is. Not about achievement. About presence. About witness. About honoring the gift."

"Yes."

"That's why Wei would have taught you. That's why I'll teach you." Kenji leans forward slightly. "But Maya—understand this. The teaching won't make dying easier. Won't make seventeen years enough. Won't make losing Kofi bearable. It will make you present to all of it—the terror, the grief, the love, the rage. Everything sharp instead of numb. Is that what you want?"

Maya meets his eyes. Her uncle who sought for seven years. Who found Wei exhausted. Who learned to stop seeking and start staying. Who teaches from not-knowing instead of expertise. Who embodies presence without pretending it fixes anything.

"Yes," she says. "That's exactly what I want."

Kenji nods. "Then we'll practice together. Daily. Morning session with everyone—you'll learn alongside the community. Afternoon sessions—just us, intensive, everything I can transmit. Three months of teaching. Then: physics."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. This work is hard. You'll sit with pain. Face fear. Grieve while alive. Practice won't rescue you from any of it."

"Good. I don't want rescue. I want presence."

"Then you understand the teaching already." Kenji turns to Kofi. "You too? Want to learn?"

Kofi looks uncertain. "I'm only fourteen. I don't know if I can—"

"Can you breathe?"

"Yes."

"That's the whole practice. Breathing. Noticing. Returning. Age doesn't matter. Understanding doesn't matter. Just: showing up. Being here. Can you do that?"

"I think so."

"Then you can practice. Welcome." Kenji glances at Mama. "You've taught them well. Wei would be proud."

Mama's eyes fill. "She left me a letter. Year 10. Said to open it when I needed wisdom but she wasn't here. I haven't opened it yet. Waiting for—I don't know. The right moment."

"Maybe there is no right moment," Kenji says gently. "Maybe now is always right moment. Maybe later is just fear pretending to be discernment."

Mama absorbs this. Nods. "Maybe."

People are arriving. Maya hears voices, footsteps. The community gathering. Everyone coming to practice. Everyone learning to die awake.

Uncle Kenji stands, moves to greet them. Sixty people eventually—the room filling. Younger people Maya's age. Elders ancient and present. Parents with children. Veterans with trauma. Everyone carrying their specific fear, their specific grief, their specific three months.

Maya sees them all. Recognizes the seeking. Recognizes the terror. Recognizes the desperate hope that practice will fix something.

It won't. Kenji will teach them that. Won't fix anything. Just makes being present possible. Just transforms hiding into witness.

That's enough. That's everything.

The session begins.

---

Thirty minutes of sitting.

Kenji's instructions are simple: "Find your seat. Settle into your body. Notice breath. When mind wanders—and it will—return gently. No force. No judgment. Just: noticing and returning. That's the whole practice."

Maya sits. Eyes closed. Finds breath.

One. In.

Two. Out.

Three. Mind wandering immediately—*This is it, intensive training, three months, I need to learn everything, I need to—*

Notice. Return.

Four. In.

Five. Out.

Six. Mind wandering—*Kofi is sitting two seats over, is he okay? Is he understanding? Should I—*

Notice. Return.

Seven. In.

Eight. Out.

The practice isn't peaceful. Isn't calm. Is just: returning. Over and over. Mind wandering a thousand times, returning a thousand times. This is what Kenji meant—not achieving anything, just being here with what is. Right now: restless mind. Right now: returning. That's complete.

Nine. In.

Ten. Out.

Somewhere during the sitting, something shifts. Not dramatic. Not enlightenment. Just: a moment of being with breath without the commentary. Present. Here. Now. The gap between understanding and being closes for three seconds. Then immediately: *That was it! I did it!* And it's gone.

But those three seconds were real. Were presence. Were the teaching happening.

Eleven. In.

Twelve. Out.

The bell rings. Thirty minutes complete. Maya opens her eyes.

Kofi looks overwhelmed. Mama looks tearful. The sixty people in the circle look various shades of confused, frustrated, peaceful, present. Everyone doing the practice. Everyone learning.

"Thoughts?" Kenji asks the group.

A woman in her fifties speaks first. "My mind wouldn't stop. I counted to three and lost track. Over and over. Is that normal?"

"That's exactly practice. Mind wanders. You notice. You return. That's not failure—that's the work."

A young man, maybe twenty. "I don't feel different. I thought meditation was supposed to make you feel peaceful."

"Peaceful is sometimes result. Not the goal. The goal is presence. Being here with what you actually feel. Including not-peaceful. You showed up. You sat for thirty minutes. You returned to breath however many times. That's complete."

An older woman. "I cried the whole time. Couldn't stop. Is that okay?"

"Yes. Grief is appropriate. Being present includes being present to pain. You didn't run from the tears. That's practice."

Maya listens to the exchanges. Sees Kenji teaching—not from expertise, from presence. Meeting each person where they are. Reflecting their experience without trying to fix it. This is Wei's teaching continued. This is Picture Ten: marketplace, gift-bestowing hands. Teaching as transmission, not achievement.

"Maya," Kenji says. She startles slightly. "First meditation in Antarctica. How was it?"

Sixty people turn to look at her. Maya feels exposure. But also: invitation. To speak truth. To be honest. To teach through being taught.

"Difficult," she says. "My mind wandered constantly. I'd return to breath and immediately my mind would spin off. But—" She pauses. "But there were a few seconds. Maybe three seconds total. Where I was just with breath. No commentary. No trying. Just: here. Then my mind grabbed at it and it vanished. But those three seconds were real."

"Yes," Kenji says. "Three seconds of presence is complete. Not incomplete because brief. Not failure because you couldn't sustain it. Just: three seconds of being here. That's the teaching. That's enough."

"Tomorrow," Kenji continues to the group, "we'll sit again. Same practice. Mind will wander. You'll return. Day after: same. For three months. Not achieving anything. Just: showing up. Being here."

The session concludes. People disperse slowly—some lingering to talk, some leaving quietly, some sitting longer in the space. The community presence continuing beyond formal practice.

Maya stays seated. Kofi beside her. Mama talking quietly with another parent. The room gradually emptying.

Kenji approaches. Sits beside them.

"Intensive training," he says to Maya. "Daily afternoon sessions. Just us. Starting tomorrow. Two PM. Here. We'll practice together. One on one. I'll teach everything I can. You'll absorb what you absorb. Three months. That's the agreement."

"Yes."

"Kofi," Kenji turns to her brother. "You're welcome to join sometimes. But intensive is intense. Long silences. Hard questions. Deep practice. Might be boring for fourteen-year-old."

Kofi looks at Maya. "Will you teach me separately? Like you've been teaching me?"

"Yes," Maya says. "Every evening. We'll practice together. Me and you. Like Lagos. Like Wei's garden."

"Okay." Kofi seems relieved. "I want to learn but I don't want to do intense all the time. I'm still—I'm still me."

"Being you is perfect," Kenji says. "Practice doesn't erase personality. Just makes you present to who you are. Stay yourself. Be here as yourself. That's complete."

They sit together—Maya, Kofi, Kenji, Mama joining them. Four people in an emptying room. Family. Teachers and students. Everyone learning. Everyone dying. Everyone here.

"Three months," Maya says. Not question. Statement.

"Three months," Kenji confirms.

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be."

The answer settles. Maya accepts it. Not satisfied. Not resigned. Just: accepting. Three months of practice. Three months of transmission. Three months of being awake. Then: the ending.

But right now: beginning.

---

Night returns.

Maya lies in the top bunk listening to Kofi breathe. Another full day in Antarctica complete. Met Uncle Kenji. Started practice. Arranged intensive training. Explored the district with family. Planted mint with Kofi (miracle—Uncle David found soil somewhere, built a small box, helped Kofi plant the cutting from Wei's garden carefully).

Three months begins now.

She counts her breaths in the darkness.

One. In.

Two. Out.

Three. Her mind wanders to tomorrow—first intensive session, what will Kenji teach, will she understand, will three months be enough—

Notice. Return.

Four. In.

Five. Out.

Below her, Kofi's breath steady. Fourteen years, three months old. Three months remaining. Then: no more breath. No more Kofi. The grief is always there. The practice doesn't remove it. Just makes room for it alongside the love.

Six. In.

Seven. Out.

She thinks about the community session. Sixty people practicing. Everyone learning to be present. Everyone facing death together. The transmission spreading—Wei to Mama to Maya, Wei to Kenji to hundreds. Different doors, same presence. The teaching multiplying until there are no people left to teach.

But while there are people: teach. While there is presence: practice. While there is breath: count.

Eight. In.

Nine. Out.

Tomorrow she'll wake early. Practice alone before breakfast. Join the morning session with the community. Then afternoon: intensive with Kenji.

Ten. In.

Eleven. Out.

Maya feels sleep approaching. Lets it come. Tomorrow will arrive whether she sleeps or not. The asteroid will arrive whether she practices or not. Death will come whether she's ready or not.

But she'll be present. Awake. Witnessing. Here until she isn't.

That's all anyone can do.

That's everything.

Twelve. In.

Thirteen. Out.

She thinks of Wei's final words: *The flower bloomed.*

Yes. Maya will bloom. For three more months. Seventeen years, seven months total. Brief. Complete. Here.

Fourteen. In.

Fifteen. Out.

Sleep takes her gently. Tomorrow waits. Practice continues. Life persists until it doesn't.

But tonight: rest. Presence even to that.

Seventeen breaths into sleep. The number of years she'll never exceed. The number she'll be. Exactly. Precisely. Here.
