**Post-Impact | Year 15, Month 4 | Earth**

Impact.

The asteroid strikes the Pacific Ocean at hypersonic speed. Rock and water and atmosphere meet with energy beyond anything the planet has experienced in billions of years.

In the first instant, ocean becomes steam, then plasma. A transient crater forms in water and crust—fifteen kilometers deep, hundreds across—before rebounding, collapsing, erasing itself in molten turbulence.

The thermal pulse races outward at light speed. Air flashes to fire. Clouds become incandescent. The sky over the Pacific brightens beyond noon, then beyond any human concept of brightness, then beyond any eye's capacity to see.

Thirty seconds later, the leading edge of the shockwave reaches Antarctica.

Ice sheets flex and shatter. Bedrock rings. Surface structures—towers, walkways, platforms, neighborhoods—fail almost simultaneously. Metal frames crumple, concrete powders, glass vaporizes. Solar arrays that tracked the sun for fourteen years sublimate into expanding gas, etched circuitry reduced to a trace in the plasma wind.

Buildings collapse faster than sound can carry the noise of their own failure. What was a megacity becomes a moving cloud of dust and vapor and incandescent fragments, then nothing distinct at all.

Across the globe, seismic waves wrap the planet again and again. Oceans surge into continents. Mountain ranges slump. Fault lines long locked release in minutes what they stored for millennia. The atmosphere convects, glows, strips itself of stable patterns. Weather, as a concept, ends.

From orbit—if any eye still watched—the planet would look briefly like a star that tried to be born and failed. A bright wound opens on the night side, spreads, fades. Thermal signatures smear, then blur, then settle toward evenness.

In hours, the surface is an ocean of rock transitioning between liquid and solid. Nothing that once lived persists in recognizable form. No structures. No archives. No machines quietly waiting to be powered back on. Everything that remembered, recorded, or extended human presence has joined the same undifferentiated flow.

In time, dust and aerosols spread through the thickening atmosphere. The sky, if there were an eye to see it, would shift color and texture, opacity and glow.

As the planet cools toward a new equilibrium, crust thickens. A different pattern of plates and faults and basins emerges. Rain falls again. New oceans gather in new depressions. Volcanic ridges raise new islands above the water. Storms streak across a sky without memory.

In sheltered places—on cooling rock at a shoreline, around a deep-sea vent in a newborn ocean, within porous stone that was once buried beneath a vanished city—chemical gradients form. Molecules organize, fall apart, reorganize. Some persist longer than others. Complexity ratchets upward by increments no consciousness remains to count.

The planet turns.

It orbits.

It responds.

It does not grieve. It does not remember. Rocks and atmospheres do not carry stories in any way that resembles intention.

What happened in the fifteen years between detection and impact leaves no durable mark here. No monument survives. No inscription. No fossil arranged to say: they knew, and they chose presence anyway.

From the outside, the entire arc of human consciousness is a thin film on a cooling rock that briefly lit up and rearranged the surface chemistry.

From the inside, for as long as an inside existed, it was everything.

Breath by breath. Choice by choice. Maintenance check by maintenance check. Prayer by prayer. Laugh by laugh. Hand on fur, hand in hand, hand on worn-out console. All of it: complete for its length.

There is no afterimage in the rock. No echo in the sky. No observer to declare meaning.

Still, for fifteen years, they were here.

The flower bloomed.
