# Chapter 52: Ordinary

**Multiple POVs | Year 15, Month 3, Day 26 | Antarctica**

---

## Amara & David — Platform 73

5:47 AM. David wakes to the alarm he's set for fourteen years. Amara still sleeps beside him—she worked late at the monitoring station, tracking an asteroid that no longer needs tracking. The numbers don't change anymore. Impact in twenty-six days. Trajectory certain. Death guaranteed.

He dresses quietly. The apartment is full now—Zara and Kwame on the fold-out couch, Maya and Kofi in the second bedroom. Sixty square meters holding six people. Family. Three months ago it was just him and Amara. Now: everyone. Convergence made visible through bodies in space.

He makes tea. The ritual automatic after fourteen years. Kettle heating. Cup warming. Presence through repetition. The infrastructure groans around him—heating systems protesting Antarctic cold, power flickering briefly then stabilizing. The arrays still function. Ninety-three percent capacity. He'll check them today. Same as yesterday. Same as tomorrow. Twenty-five more tomorrows. Then: no more checking.

Maya emerges from the bedroom, already dressed. Seventeen years, five months old. Eighty-five days of intensive training with Kenji complete. Five days remaining before they shift to final convergence mode.

"Morning, Uncle David."

"Morning. Tea?"

"Please."

They sit at the small table. The same table where they sat three months ago when Zara's family first arrived. Where Maya asked about detection, about Amara's numbness, about being conscious while dying. Now: comfortable silence. Family silence. The kind that doesn't need filling.

"Platform today?" Maya asks.

"Yes. Systems need checking."

"Can I come?"

David pauses. They did this once before, Month 2. She learned maintenance, understood meaning through physical work. But today—twenty-six days left—does she need that again? Or does she need something else?

"What about Kenji's teaching?" he asks.

"Afternoon session. Morning is free. I want to be with you. On the arrays. One more time."

One more time. Everything is one more time now.

"Okay. We leave at six."

They drink tea together. Through the window, Antarctica wakes—artificial lights against polar night, buildings stretching to horizon, one point two million people beginning their twenty-sixth-to-last day. Some will spend it raging. Some hiding. Some present. All valid. All witnessed.

"Uncle David," Maya says quietly. "Are you scared?"

"Terrified."

"But you still go to work."

"Yes."

"That's enough?"

"Has to be."

She nods. Understands. They finish their tea in silence.

---

The transport climbs through darkness. Maya beside him, 47B waiting at Platform 73. The robot hasn't changed—same precise positioning, same diagnostic readiness. Twelve years of partnership. Twenty-six days remaining.

*Beep beep.* "Good morning, Colleague Chen. Maya Okafor-Mensah. Systems functioning at ninety-three percent. Platform seventeen requires minor recalibration. Estimated completion time: two hours, fourteen minutes. Weather conditions: optimal. Twenty-six days until cessation of function."

Even 47B counts down. David hadn't programmed that. The robot must be accessing global data, understanding context. Strange comfort in knowing even artificial intelligence witnesses the ending.

"Good morning, 47B," Maya says. She crouches beside the robot, familiar now. "Let's maintain what needs maintaining."

They work together—human, human, robot. The rhythm David knows in his bones. Connection housings checked. Voltage regulators calibrated. Panels cleaned. The megacity below depends on this. Thirty thousand people receiving power because three beings show up and do the work.

Maya is competent now. Learned fast in Month 2. Asks good questions. Sees systems clearly. Would have been exceptional engineer. Twenty-six days isn't enough time to become what she might have been. But enough time to understand what maintenance means. Enough time to practice presence through physical work.

"Uncle David," she says during platform seventeen. "I'm teaching tomorrow. Kenji asked me to lead a session. For the young adults. Thabo, Amara, Jamal, the others."

"That's good."

"I'm terrified."

"What will you teach?"

"I don't know. What do you teach people who'll be dead in twenty-six days? What wisdom matters when nothing lasts?"

David sets down his diagnostic tablet. Looks at his niece—seventeen years old, brilliant, about to teach her peers how to die awake.

"Teach what you know," he says. "You practiced two years, eight months. You know presence. You know rage and gratitude both. You know brief life matters. That's what they need. Not answers. Just: your honest experience."

"Is that enough?"

"Ask me in twenty-six days." He smiles. "That's what Kenji told Thabo."

Maya laughs—brief sound against cold air. "Everyone says that now. 'Ask me in twenty-six days.' Like we'll know something then we don't know now."

"Maybe we will. Maybe dying teaches something living can't. Or maybe we'll die not knowing. Either way: we show up until we can't. That's complete."

They work in silence for an hour. 47B glides between them, providing tools, monitoring their progress, occasionally offering efficiency observations. Perfect coordination built through repetition. Brief doesn't mean incomplete. This morning matters. This maintenance matters. Even knowing it ends.

At 9:00 AM they finish. Platform seventeen recalibrated. Systems holding at ninety-three percent. Twenty-six more days of power guaranteed. Maybe more. Probably not needed. But guaranteed anyway.

*Beep beep.* "Excellent work, Colleagues. System integrity optimal. This unit appreciates human-robot collaboration. Probability of continued optimal function: high for remaining operational period."

"Thank you, 47B," David says.

Maya touches the robot's sensor array—brief gesture, affectionate. "See you tomorrow, 47B."

*Beep.* "Anticipated. This unit values consistency."

They ride the transport back down. Maya quiet, processing. David understands. She's preparing to teach. Organizing what she knows. Finding words for experience that transcends words. Same thing Kenji does. Same thing Ibrahim does. Same thing everyone teaching presence does—pointing at moon while knowing the pointing isn't the moon.

"You'll do well tomorrow," David says.

"How do you know?"

"Because you show up. Because you practice. Because you're honest. That's all teaching is."

"I hope that's enough."

"It has to be."

## Zara & Family — Building 14, Unit 7B

Zara wakes to Kofi's energy. Always Kofi's energy. Fourteen years, five months of that energy. Twenty-six days remaining.

He's already up, dressed, bouncing. "Mama! Can we go to the community center? Kenji's teaching at ten! I want to see Maya teach tomorrow! Can we? Please?"

Kwame still sleeps—he had late shift helping with community meals yesterday. Amara and David already gone to the arrays. Maya with them. Just Zara and Kofi in the small living space.

"Yes, love. We'll go. But first: breakfast. You need fuel."

"I'm not hungry. I'm excited! Twenty-six days, Mama! Twenty-six days until we all die together! Isn't that amazing? We get to be together!"

Zara's heart breaks and soars simultaneously. Her son—beautiful, present, alive—celebrating convergence. Not denying death. Not hiding from it. Just: excited to face it with family. That's what fourteen years of Wei's teaching through her, through Maya, through community created. A child who knows he's dying and is grateful for the time he has.

"Yes, love. Twenty-six days together. Now eat."

She makes breakfast—synth-protein, fruit, tea. Kofi talks continuously. About yesterday's teaching session. About Ibrahim's wisdom. About Hassan's prayers. About Min-seo who died but whose mint still grows in forty apartments. About Derek's walking meditation. About Thabo's questions. Everything connected. Everyone teaching everyone. The web visible now.

"Mama," Kofi says between bites. "When we die, will it hurt?"

Direct question. Honest question. She could lie. Could comfort. Could bypass.

She chooses truth.

"I don't know, love. Probably. The asteroid will hit the Pacific. The shockwave will reach Antarctica in seconds. We'll have maybe thirty seconds of knowing. Then: light. Heat. End. It will be fast. But probably painful."

He processes this. Not scared. Just: considering. "Will you hold my hand?"

"Yes. Papa and I will both hold you. Maya will be there. Aunt Amara. Uncle David. Uncle Kenji. Grandmother Elena. Everyone. We'll face it together."

"That's good." He finishes his fruit. "I'm glad we came here. To Antarctica. I miss Lagos. Miss Mr. Okonkwo and Adanna and Samuel. But this is good too. Family."

"Adanna and Samuel are coming," Zara says. "For the final week. They'll be here in four days."

Kofi's face lights up. "Really? They're coming? To die with us?"

"Yes. They chose family too."

"That's perfect! Then everyone I love will be here! Well, except Wei. But she's dead already. Natural death. Lucky her—she got to die awake, teaching. I want to die like that. Teaching. Being present. Not screaming. Just: here."

Zara pulls him close. Fourteen years old. Talking about dying like discussing weather. Not dissociation. Presence. He's practiced three years. Since age eleven. Maya taught him. Zara taught him. Wei's lineage transmitted through family. Now he faces the end better than most adults. Brief life. Complete life.

"You will, love. We'll practice every day until we can't. Then we'll be present together. That's all anyone can do."

"Is that enough?"

She hears the echo—everyone asking the same question. Is presence enough? Is showing up enough? Is twenty-six days enough? Is brief life enough?

"It has to be," she says. "Because it's what we have."

## Elena — Morning Writing

Elena sits in her apartment, journal open. Physical paper, pen in hand. Seventeen years of documentation. Someone should witness the witness. Someone should record how humanity faced extinction.

That someone is her.

**Year 15, Month 3, Day 26**

*Twenty-six days remain. Population: 1,200,000. Everyone who chose Antarctica is here. Everyone who chose elsewhere is there. Final convergence complete.*

*I governed this continent seventeen years. Built for millennia. Collapsed to extinction. Maintained dignity through impossible circumstances. Today: I'm not mayor. Haven't been for four months. Just: witness. Just: person who shows up. That's enough. That has to be enough.*

*Daniel Okonkwo died seven months ago. I learned about it twenty-five days ago. I carry that weight. The cost of choosing justice over mercy. Priya Patel carries parallel weight—thirteen years of silence toward man who killed her husband. We're learning mercy too late to help Daniel. But we're teaching others. That's also transmission. Learning from failure. Witnessing our own hardness. Practicing differently now.*

*Morning briefings ended four months ago. But Chen and Kowalski still meet me for tea. Thursday mornings. Fifteen years of ritual transformed. We don't govern anymore. We just: show up for each other. That's enough.*

*Kenji teaches two hundred people now. Twenty-six days ago it was sixty. Growth through final month. Everyone seeking presence before the end. My son—thirty-seven years old, Picture Eight reached—teaches without trying to teach. Just: is. The ox forgotten. The self forgotten. Only presence remains.*

*Maya will teach tomorrow. My granddaughter. Seventeen years old. Eighty-five days of intensive training. Five days remaining before final convergence mode. She's ready. Not ready for death. But ready to be present. That's different. That's possible. That's what we teach.*

*I'm satisfied. Not with all choices. Daniel haunts me. But with showing up. With bearing witness. With maintaining dignity. Seventeen years of impossible work. Twenty-six days remaining. That's complete.*

*We were here. We mattered. We faced the end together.*

*Someone should say that.*

*I will.*

She closes the journal. Stands. Her apartment is small—standard housing, same as everyone else. She gave up the mayor's residence Year 14. Didn't need space. Needed simplicity. Needed to live like everyone she governed. Like everyone she witnesses.

Her terminal chimes. Message from Kenji: *Teaching at 10 AM. Maya leading young adult session tomorrow 2 PM. You're welcome at both. Love, your son.*

She replies: *I'll be there. Both sessions. Love, your mother.*

Simple words. Real words. Fifteen years of distance. Five years of reconnection. Now: family. Chosen family. Practice family. All the same thing.

She makes tea. Drinks it slowly. Watches Antarctica through the window. One point two million people. Everyone converging. Everyone practicing. Everyone facing the end together.

Twenty-six days.

That's enough.

## Kenji — Community Center, 10 AM

The room is packed. Two hundred people. Maximum capacity. Bodies shoulder to shoulder, sitting on cushions, chairs, floor. Children on parents' laps. Elders against walls. Everyone fitting barely.

Kenji sits at the front, slightly off-center. Wei's teaching. Don't claim the center. Make space. Teaching is invitation, not performance.

He scans the room. Familiar faces now. Thirty core students who attend daily. Ibrahim beside him, co-teaching. Hassan in the third row, practicing alongside his faith. Derek near the back, steady presence. Linnea beside him, nine months clean now, transformed through practice. Fatima organizing hospitality even during session—making sure everyone has water, cushions, space.

His mother Elena in the fifth row. Marcus Reyes beside her. Marcus Rivera on her other side. Both Marcuses. Both chosen family. The briefing team transformed—Chen and Kowalski in front, practicing fifteen years through different forms. Dr. Sarah Kim taking notes occasionally, old journalist habits, but present not documenting.

The young adults cluster left side. Thabo in front—fourteen years old, brilliant, questioning. Amara beside them, twenty-one, chemistry student, processing rage. Jamal behind, twenty-three, engineer. Others scattered—faces Kenji knows from weeks of practice. All facing death before living. All choosing presence anyway.

Parents and children throughout. Adaeze with daughter Chioma. Pavel with his three kids. Others Kenji doesn't know by name but recognizes by presence. Everyone bringing their families. Everyone teaching their children. Transmission continuing through generations that won't have time to grow old.

Barak Naveh sits quietly mid-circle. Forty-eight years old. Freed from prison eighteen months ago. Teaches through being. Doesn't speak much. Just: steady. Present. Shaped by guilt not consumed by it. Others gather near him instinctively. Seeking that groundedness. That calm.

Obi Nwosu crosses his arms but his face is open. Fifty-seven years old. Three years of practice. Still skeptical. Still showing up. Still asking hard questions that give others permission to doubt. Essential voice. Honest voice.

Chen Liwei with his family—wife Mei, adult children, three grandchildren ages fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Same ages as the young people dying young. Multi-generational learning. Everyone facing the same end. The hierarchy dissolved. Elder and child both practicing. Both dying. Both present.

Asha Marin in back—fifty-five, artist, creator of "Witness" installation that forces people to see themselves seeing. Two years of practice transformed her provocations into presence. Now she observes, creates, witnesses through art and meditation both.

Soso Kim near the side—fifty years old, Dog Adoption Center coordinator. Five years of practice shifted her environmental grief into presence with current life. Her twelve remaining dogs—she'll bring them to final convergence. Witnessing any life fully is witnessing all life.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka sits quietly observing. Fifty-three years old. Maya and Kofi's pediatrician fifteen years. Witnessed their complete childhoods. Measured growth toward no future. Practice transformed her clinical work into sacred witness. She's here because presence medicine is all medicine now. Nothing to fix. Just: witness. Just: presence. Just: being with life while life remains.

And more. So many more. Two hundred people. Each carrying their own weight. Each showing up. Each choosing presence over despair. Twenty-six days left. Practice continuing until it can't.

Kenji rings the bell. The sound cuts through murmurs. Two hundred people settle.

"Good morning."

"Good morning," two hundred voices respond. Some strong, some whispered, some children's voices, some elders'. All here.

"We'll begin with sitting practice. Thirty minutes. Simple instructions. Notice breath. Notice body. Notice thoughts without clinging. Notice feelings without drowning. This moment. Then this moment. Nothing more. Nothing less."

He pauses. Looks at the room. Two hundred people who chose to practice. Who chose presence. Who chose to face death awake.

"Twenty-six days remain," he says quietly. "Death is coming. We know this. We've known this fifteen years. Practice doesn't change that. Practice doesn't make death easier. Practice makes life realer. Makes this moment fuller. Makes presence possible."

Thabo's hand raises. Kenji nods.

"Kenji, I asked you this before. You said ask you in twenty-six days. Well—" Thabo's voice cracks slightly. "It's twenty-six days. Does practice help?"

The room goes absolutely still. Two hundred people waiting for answer they need desperately.

Kenji doesn't rush. Breathes. Feels the question. Remembers asking Wei similar questions. Remembers her honesty. Her refusal to bypass. Her insistence on truth over comfort.

"Yes," he says finally. "And no. Practice helps me be here. Helps me love what I'm losing. Helps me be present to my terror instead of consumed by it. But I'm still terrified. Still grieving. Still wishing we had more time. Practice doesn't fix that. Just makes me conscious while feeling it."

He meets Thabo's eyes. "Is that enough? I don't know. But it's what I have. It's what we all have. Twenty-six days of consciousness. Twenty-six days of presence. Twenty-six days of being here together. That has to be enough. Because it's what we've got."

Silence. Long silence. Two hundred people sitting with the truth. Not bypassed. Not sugarcoated. Just: real.

Then Amara—the chemistry student—speaks. "Thank you for not lying."

Others murmur agreement. Honesty over comfort. Truth over consolation. Presence over bypassing.

"Let's practice," Kenji says. Rings the bell again.

Two hundred people close their eyes. Settle into meditation posture—sitting, standing, kneeling, whatever works for their bodies. Parents holding children. Elders supporting walls. Veterans sitting straight. Everyone finding their way into practice.

Kenji closes his eyes. Returns to breath.

One.

Two.

Three.

Around him, two hundred people breathing together. Not achieving anything. Not fixing anything. Just: here. Present. Conscious. Together.

The community center creaks in Antarctic wind. Heating systems groan. Power flickers briefly then holds. Outside, infrastructure barely maintains. Inside, two hundred people choose presence anyway.

Four.

Five.

Kenji's mind wanders. Thinks about Wei. About her death Year 11. About the flower blooming. About Picture Nine—returning to source. Home was always here. About Picture Ten—marketplace with gift-bestowing hands. Teaching others. Giving away everything learned. Transmission continuing until no one left to transmit to.

Notice. Return.

Six.

His mother Elena practicing beside Marcus Reyes and Marcus Rivera. Briefing family. Thursday family. All family. Seventeen years of governance transformed into witness. She did the work. She showed up. That's complete.

Notice. Return.

Seven.

Ibrahim beside him. Thirty-six years old. Fifteen years faithless. Four months ago—heard God's voice. Not the old faith. New faith. Deeper faith. God present in the exile. God accompanying them into death. Both/and realized. Faith and presence both.

Notice. Return.

Eight.

Maya will teach tomorrow. His niece. Seventeen years old. Star student. Ready to give away everything she learned. Picture Ten approaching. The lineage spreading: Wei → Kenji → Maya → Thabo → others. Transmission accelerating as time contracts. Everyone teaching everyone in final month.

Notice. Return.

Nine.

The practice simple. Impossible. Essential. Being here. Noticing. Returning. Not achieving. Not fixing. Just: conscious. Present. Awake.

Thirty minutes pass. Kenji rings the bell.

Two hundred people open their eyes. Some peaceful. Some frustrated. Some crying. All here. All showed up. That matters.

"How was that?" Kenji asks.

Ibrahim speaks first. "Hard. Mind everywhere. But I returned. Each time: returned. That's practice. That's enough."

Elena: "I thought about Daniel. The prisoner who died. My choice to deny mercy. But I also noticed I'm here now. Present to my mistake. Carrying it without being destroyed by it. That's what practice gives me. Not peace. Presence."

Obi: "Still skeptical. Still not sure this matters. But I came anyway. Sat anyway. Breathed anyway. That's something."

Chen: "Fifteen years I maintained systems that barely functioned. This feels similar. Maintaining presence that barely holds. But I show up. That's what I know how to do."

Others share. Brief glimpses. Honest struggles. Real presence. No one claiming enlightenment. Everyone claiming showing up. That's the teaching. That's the practice. That's enough.

After session, people linger. Not rushing out. Staying. Talking. Being together. Community forming around shared practice. Shared mortality. Shared presence.

Kenji moves through the room. Listening more than speaking. Watching connections form. Ibrahim helping Derek orient a new veteran struggling with tremors. Fatima bringing tea to Linnea who's teaching her recovery circle about craving. Priya Patel talking with Elena about unforgiveness—two women learning mercy together. Barak sitting with three young people who need steady presence. Chen and Kowalski coordinating their Thursday ritual with new attendees. Asha discussing her installation with Dr. Sarah Kim. Soso sharing how she teaches presence through animal care.

The teaching spreading. Not through Kenji alone. Through everyone. Wei's garden fully grown. Two hundred flowers blooming. Twenty-six days until they're all vaporized. But today: blooming. Today: alive. Today: present.

Maya approaches. "Tomorrow. Two PM. Young adults. I'm ready."

"I know you are."

"How do you know?"

"Because you practice. Because you're honest. Because you show up. That's all teaching is."

She nods. Walks away to join Thabo and the others. Planning tomorrow's session. The lineage continuing. Picture Ten approaching.

Kenji stands in the center of the room. Two hundred people. Community center at capacity. Twenty-six days until everyone here dies. But today: practice. Today: presence. Today: together.

Wei's words echo in his mind: *The flower bloomed.*

Yes. Still blooming. Still here. Twenty-six days of blooming remaining.

That's enough.

---

## Ibrahim — Afternoon Teaching

After Kenji's morning session, Ibrahim walks the frozen streets. Needs movement. Needs space. Needs to feel his body working despite the leg that still aches thirteen years after the wound.

He walks his old route—Building 12 to mosque, Sector 8. Four months ago he walked this route at 3 AM, desperate about Min-seo's dying. Four months ago God spoke to him in the mosque. Four months ago everything changed.

The mosque is quiet at midday. Hassan inside, preparing for afternoon prayer. Ibrahim enters. Takes off his shoes. Ritual automatic despite fifteen years faithless. The body remembers.

"Ibrahim. You're early."

"Needed to walk. Needed space."

"Sit. Tea?"

"Please."

They sit in the small room adjacent to the prayer space. Hassan makes tea. Sixty-nine years old. Fifteen years of praying without certainty. Four months ago—witnessed Ibrahim's encounter with God. Heard secondhand what God spoke. Found faith renewed through someone else's hearing.

"Twenty-six days," Hassan says. Not question. Statement.

"Twenty-six days," Ibrahim confirms.

"Are you ready?"

"No. But present. That's different."

"Yes." Hassan pours tea. "Fifty people came to prayer last night. More every day. Everyone seeking. Everyone preparing. Some faithful. Some desperate. Some just—trying. All welcome."

"That's both/and."

"Yes. Everything is both/and now. Faith and doubt. Prayer and meditation. God and presence. All the same thing. All different. All true." Hassan sips his tea. "I prayed for certainty fifteen years. Never came. Then you heard God. Not me. You. The faithless one. And suddenly I understood—certainty isn't the point. Presence is. God is here whether I'm certain or not. That's enough."

Ibrahim understands. His own faith transformed. Not returning to the old certainty. Moving forward to new knowing. God spoke. God is here. God accompanies them into death. That's both/and. That's faith and presence both.

"This afternoon," Hassan continues. "I'm teaching integrated session. Twenty-five people. The core students. Maya, Kofi, Elena, both Marcuses, Chen, Kowalski, Linnea, Derek, Fatima, Samir, Barak, others. Muslim prayer and Buddhist meditation and Christian contemplation all together. Will you co-teach?"

"Yes. What do we teach?"

"Same thing we always teach. Presence. Through all paths. All leading to same truth—being here completely. Twenty-six days left. Everyone needs this. All of it."

---

Three PM. The integrated session gathers. Twenty-five people in the mosque's main space. Prayer mats arranged in circle. No hierarchy. No separation. Everyone learning from everyone.

Hassan begins with Muslim prayer. *Allahu Akbar.* God is greatest. The words land differently now. Not conquest. Not certainty. Just: acknowledgment. Something greater than humans exists. Something present in the dying. Something accompanying them.

They prostrate together. Foreheads to ground. Complete surrender. The posture teaching what words can't—being human means bowing to something beyond yourself. Death. God. Mystery. Whatever name you use.

Marcus Reyes leads Christian contemplation next. Sixty-eight years old. Returned from Mumbai after thirteen years. Brings different wisdom. Different prayers. Same truth.

"In my tradition," he says quietly, "we talk about the valley of the shadow of death. For fifteen years I thought that was metaphor. Now I know—we're walking through it. All of us. Together. And the psalm says: 'I will fear no evil, for you are with me.' Not 'you will save me.' Not 'you will prevent death.' Just: 'you are with me.' Presence. Accompaniment. That's what God offers. Not rescue. Company."

He leads them in silent prayer. Centering prayer. Resting in divine presence. Christian meditation that's remarkably similar to Buddhist practice. Sitting still. Being present. Opening to what's larger than yourself.

Ibrahim watches twenty-five people pray together. Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, uncertain—all practicing. All present. All facing the same death. The differences real. The similarities deeper. Both/and.

Kenji teaches Buddhist meditation last. Breath awareness. Body awareness. Presence to what is. No God mentioned. No faith required. Just: here. Now. This breath. This moment.

But it's the same thing Hassan taught. Same thing Marcus taught. Same thing Ibrahim experienced four months ago. Different doors into the same room. Different words pointing at the same moon. Different practices leading to the same presence.

After teaching, they sit together. Twenty-five people. No longer practicing. Just: being.

Maya speaks first. "This is what Wei taught. Not one way. Many ways. All valid. All leading to presence. I practice Buddhist meditation. Kofi does too. But we also listen to Hassan's prayers. We also hear Marcus's contemplation. It's all the same practice. Being here. Being present. Being with what is."

Kofi adds: "At school in Lagos—before we came here—teacher said religions fight. Said people kill over God. But you're all teaching together. You're all friends. How?"

Hassan answers: "Because we know we're dying. When death is certain, fighting about whose God is real becomes absurd. Instead: we share. We teach each other. We learn from each other. Your uncle Ibrahim heard God. I didn't. But I believe because he heard. That's how faith works. Not competition. Transmission."

"Both/and," Elena says. Her voice carries seventeen years of governance, of bearing witness, of learning the hard way. "That's what I'm learning. Justice and mercy. Anger and peace. Faith and doubt. Dying and living. All of it true. All of it held together. Practice doesn't choose between them. Practice holds them both."

Priya Patel nods. "I carried rage thirteen years. Now I carry rage and compassion both. They coexist. Practice didn't take away the rage. Just made space for compassion too. That's enough. That's everything."

Barak: "Guilt and freedom. I carry both. My worst moment is part of me. So is everything after. Both true. Both real. Practice means being present to both without being consumed by either."

The sharing continues. Twenty-five people. Each naming their both/and. Each witnessing the paradox. Each holding opposites together. That's the teaching. That's the practice. That's what facing death honestly requires.

After session, people linger again. Not rushing. Staying. Being together. Derek leads walking meditation outside—fifteen people walking slowly, counting steps, being present to movement. Fatima prepares tea for everyone, hospitality as practice. Samir teaches signs to new learners, communication without sound. Linnea shares her recovery story with someone newly struggling. The community web visible. Everyone holding everyone.

Ibrahim stands beside Hassan and Kenji and Marcus Reyes. Four teachers. Four paths. One truth.

"Twenty-six days," Hassan says. "Then we all die. Together. Everyone here. Does what we're teaching matter?"

"Yes," Ibrahim says without hesitation. "Whether it helps with death—I don't know. But it helps with life. These twenty-six days. These people. This presence. That's real. That's enough."

Kenji: "Wei said the flower blooms three days. That's complete. We're blooming now. Twenty-six days. That's our complete bloom. That's enough."

Marcus Reyes: "In Mumbai I taught refugee children who had no future. I taught anyway. Because teaching mattered while it mattered. Same thing here. We teach twenty-six more days. Then we die. But the teaching was real. The presence was real. That counts."

Hassan: "God is present. I know that now. Not because God spoke to me. Because God spoke to Ibrahim. That's enough. We pray twenty-six more days. We teach twenty-six more days. We practice twenty-six more days. Then: we face death together. Present. Accompanied. That's complete."

Four teachers. Agreement. The work matters. The teaching matters. The presence matters. Not because it prevents death. Because it makes life real until life ends.

Twenty-six days.

That's enough.

## Maya — Final Preparations

Evening. Maya sits on the top bunk in her aunt's apartment. Kofi sleeps below—exhausted from the day's teachings, the walking meditation, the integrated session. Fourteen years old and practicing harder than most adults. Brief life. Complete life.

Tomorrow she teaches. Two PM. Young adults. Thabo, Amara, Jamal, and others. The ones dying youngest. The ones with most to rage about. Her peers. Her generation. Everyone stolen from futures they'll never have.

What does she teach them?

She pulls out her notebook. Physical paper. Recording thoughts like Grandmother Elena records witness. Someone should document what the young people think. Someone should record how children face extinction.

That someone is her.

**Year 15, Month 3, Day 26 — Final Preparations**

*Tomorrow I teach for the first time. Uncle Kenji asked me to lead the young adult session. Twenty people. Ages fourteen to twenty-five. Everyone dying before they finish becoming who they might have been.*

*What do I teach? Not that death is okay—it's not. Not that practice fixes anything—it doesn't. Not that brief life is enough—it isn't.*

*I teach: presence is possible. Rage and gratitude coexist. Brief doesn't mean incomplete—it means exactly as complete as the time you have makes you. You can be conscious while dying. You can be present to what you're losing. You can love fiercely even knowing you'll lose everything.*

*I teach: what I know. Two years, eight months of practice. Eighty-five days intensive training. Rage every day. Gratitude every day. Both. Always both.*

*Wei taught Mama. Mama taught me. Uncle Kenji taught me. Uncle David taught me through maintenance. Grandmother Elena teaches through witness. Uncle Ibrahim teaches through recovered faith. Everyone teaches. I teach tomorrow. The lineage continues until no one left.*

*Twenty-six days. Then I die at seventeen years, seven months, four days. Never eighteen. Never adult. Never who I might have become. Just: who I am. Brief Maya. Complete Maya. Present Maya.*

*That has to be enough. Because it's what I have.*

*Tomorrow I teach that.*

She closes the notebook. Lies back on the bunk. Thinks about tomorrow. About Thabo's questions. About Amara's rage. About Jamal's despair. About all the young people struggling to be present when presence means witnessing everything stolen from them.

She's ready. Not ready for death. But ready to teach. Ready to share what she knows. Ready to be honest about what she doesn't. That's Picture Ten approaching. Marketplace. Gift-bestowing hands. Teaching others even while dying.

Below, Kofi stirs. Murmurs in sleep. Still dreaming. Still young enough to rest despite everything.

Maya watches him. Her brother. Her responsibility. The child she taught to read, to practice, to face death consciously. He'll die three months before her. Month 4, Day 1. Impact day. She'll watch him die. Then die herself thirty seconds later when the shockwave reaches them.

The anticipatory grief is crushing. She feels it every day. Every moment. Practice doesn't take it away. Just teaches her to be present to it. To love him fiercely while knowing she'll lose him. To be grateful for fourteen years, five months while raging that it's not enough. Both/and. Always both.

"I love you, Kofi," she whispers. He doesn't hear. Sleeps on.

Tomorrow she teaches. Tonight she practices. Being here. Being present. Being with her brother while her brother remains. Twenty-six days. Then: no more brother. No more Maya. No more anyone.

But tonight: both alive. Both breathing. Both here.

That's enough.

That has to be enough.

## Convergence — Community Visible

Midnight. Antarctica sleeps. But not everyone. Throughout the megacity, people awake. People practicing. People preparing. Everyone converging toward the same ending.

At Platform 73, systems hold at ninety-three percent. 47B performs autonomous diagnostics. Robot colleague maintaining what needs maintaining. Twenty-six more days of function guaranteed.

In Building 14, Unit 7B, six people sleep. Amara and David in the bedroom. Zara and Kwame on the fold-out couch. Maya and Kofi in the second room. Family. Convergence made visible through bodies in space.

Elena sits in her apartment, journal open. Writing final entries. Seventeen years of witness. Twenty-six days remaining. Someone should document this. She volunteers.

At the community center, cushions wait for tomorrow. Two hundred people's practice space. The heart of District 5. Teaching continuing until it can't.

The mosque in Sector 8 stands quiet. Hassan sleeps nearby. Fifty people will pray tomorrow. Muslim, Buddhist, Christian, uncertain—all welcome. All practicing. All facing death together.

In Building 12, Ibrahim doesn't sleep. He sits by his window. Unit 403. Looking out at the megacity. Fifty-three steps down to ground level. He doesn't count them anymore. Doesn't need to. God is here. That's enough.

Derek leads insomnia walk—twelve people moving through frozen streets, counting steps, walking meditation at midnight. Veterans, refugees, the ones who can't sleep. Everyone learning presence through movement.

Fatima prepares food for tomorrow. Community meals. Hospitality as practice. Feeding people who'll die in twenty-six days. The work matters while it matters.

Linnea sits in Unit 418, Building 12. Nine months clean. Craving persistent. But present to craving instead of consumed by it. Tomorrow she teaches her recovery circle. Sharing what she learned. Transmission through brokenness.

Thabo lies awake. Fourteen years old. Born Year 1. Never knew world before detection. Tomorrow: Maya teaches. Thabo will ask questions. Hard questions. Real questions. The ones everyone's thinking but afraid to say.

At Dog Adoption Center, District 12, Soso Kim tends her twelve remaining dogs. Everyone else's dogs abandoned or euthanized. These twelve—she keeps them. Witnesses them. Loves them until the end. Teaches through animal care. Presence made visible through tending life.

Asha Marin's "Witness" installation stands empty in District 5. Circular space. Mirrors surrounding. Countdown clock projected overhead. Mannequins in viewing positions. Tomorrow people will stand inside. See themselves seeing. Notice what they brought into the room. Art as practice. Mirror as teacher.

In District 7, Chen Liwei sleeps beside his wife Mei. Three generations in one apartment. Grandchildren ages fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Same ages as Maya, as the young people dying young. Everyone converging toward the same ending. Elder and child both practicing. Both dying. Both present.

Priya Patel sits with her daughter Aanya. Nineteen years old. Tomorrow Priya teaches about unforgiveness. About learning mercy too late. About presence with your own hardness. Her son Dev refused to attend teachings. Chose different path. That's valid too. Family doesn't have to be on same path. Both/and.

Barak Naveh sleeps peacefully. Forty-eight years old. Freed from prison eighteen months ago. Daniel's former cellmate. One walked out. One stayed. Both valid. Both honest. Only one survived to teach. Barak doesn't sleep because he's at peace. He sleeps because he practiced being present to guilt without being consumed. That's enough. That's everything.

One point two million people in Antarctica. Everyone converging. Everyone choosing. Some practicing. Some hiding. Some raging. Some present. All valid. All witnessed. All dying in twenty-six days.

But tonight: alive. Tonight: here. Tonight: breathing. Tonight: human consciousness persisting despite everything. Tonight: community holding each other. Tonight: teaching continuing. Tonight: presence possible.

The web of connection visible now. Min-seo's mint growing in forty apartments. Ibrahim's fifty-three steps walked by dozens. Wei's garden teachings transmitted through everyone. David's maintenance practice understood by workers everywhere. Elena's witness inspiring others to show up. Kenji's teaching spreading through two hundred students. Maya's fierce practice modeling how young people face death.

Everyone teaching everyone. Everyone holding everyone. Everyone practicing together.

Twenty-six days until the light takes everything.

But today: everyone here, everyone witnessed, everyone mattering.
