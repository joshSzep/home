# Chapter 52: Moment

**Kenji Torres | Year 15, Month 1 | Antarctica**

---

The community center holds sixty people.

Kenji counts them without meaning to—old habit from years of teaching, tracking who shows up, who returns, who stays. Sixty bodies on cushions, chairs, the floor. Sixty stories converging in this prefab building that used to be a storage warehouse. Ages seven to seventy-three. Children to elders. All here because something in them recognized: presence matters. Being awake matters. Even now. Especially now.

Three months until everyone in this room dies.

Kenji sits at the front, not quite centered—he learned that from Wei. Don't put yourself at the exact center. Sit slightly off, making space. Teaching isn't performance. It's invitation.

"Good morning," he says. Simple greeting. Not trying for profundity. Just: here. Present.

"Good morning," sixty voices respond. Some strong, some tentative, some barely audible. His mother Elena in the third row, seventy-three years old, fifteen years of witnessing complete. Beside her: Marcus Reyes, newly returned from Mumbai after thirteen years away. And Marcus Rivera, the other Marcus, who stayed when Reyes left. Both Marcuses present now. Both chosen family.

Chen Liwei sits near them—sixty-seven, former UN Secretary General, two months of practice since arriving Antarctica. His grandchildren scattered among the young people—ages fifteen, sixteen, seventeen. Same ages as the teenagers dying young. Multi-generational learning. Multi-generational ending.

Kowalski beside Chen—seventy-one, security chief, practicing fifteen years in one form or another. Steady. Present. Embodying duty without certainty. When Kenji first returned Year 12, Kowalski was already practicing alone, Thursday morning meditations that preceded formal teaching. Now: natural elder in the community.

"We'll begin with sitting practice," Kenji says. "Thirty minutes. Simple instructions. Notice breath. Notice body. Notice thoughts without clinging to them. Notice feelings without drowning in them. This moment. Then this moment. Then this moment. Nothing more. Nothing less. This is enough."

He rings the bell Wei gave him. The sound is clear and complete. Sixty people settle into practice.

Kenji closes his eyes. Returns to breath.

One.

Two.

Three.

His mind wanders immediately—always does. Thinks about the journey that brought him here. Thirty-seven years old. Fifteen years since detection. Left Antarctica Year 1, age twenty-three, desperately seeking answers. Wandered seven years—Tokyo, Cairo, Mumbai, Jerusalem. Seeking, seeking, always seeking. Found Wei in Lagos Year 8, age thirty. Learned to stop seeking. Learned to be present. Studied three years. Wei died Year 11. Continued teaching. Returned to Antarctica Year 12. Teaching three years now.

Everything Wei gave him, he's passing forward. Person to person. Until there are no persons left.

He notices the thought spiral. Returns to breath.

Four.

Five.

Around him, sixty people practicing. He can hear them breathing. The slight shifts of bodies on cushions. A child whimpering—parent holding them closer. The community center creaks in Antarctic wind. All of it: presence. All of it: practice.

Six.

Seven.

His niece Maya sits in the second row. Seventeen years, four months old. Three months until she dies at seventeen years, seven months. She practices with a ferocity he's never seen in anyone. Not desperation—absolute commitment. Her spine straight. Face concentrated. Completely absorbed.

She'd been studying with him for almost three years now. Started at thirteen, not long after Wei died. That awakening transformed her. Made her old before her years. Made her serious in ways that break his heart.

But also: made her ready. For what? For this. For being present. For dying awake.

Notice. Return.

Eight.

Nine.

Ibrahim is co-teaching now. Former fighter, faithless for thirteen years, recently found something. Not the old faith—something deeper. Direct encounter. He sits beside Kenji at these sessions, offers wisdom from his journey. His presence helps people—especially the broken ones, the doubters, the ones who lost belief and found presence instead.

Ten.

Kenji opens his eyes slightly. Looks at the room without really seeing it. Just: awareness. Sixty people breathing together. Community practicing together. Everyone learning to die awake even though awake means scared.

His mind quiets. Not achieving stillness—just less noise. The returning, the noticing, the practice working. Not perfect. Never perfect. Just: practice.

Fifteen.

Twenty.

Time passes. Breath continues. The practice simple and impossibly difficult. Be here. Notice. Return. It sounds small. It isn't.

Thirty minutes later, Kenji rings the bell.

Sixty people open their eyes. Some look peaceful. Some frustrated. Some crying. All present. All showed up. That matters.

"How was that?" Kenji asks. Not rhetorical. Genuinely asking.

Obi Nwosu speaks from the middle—forty-seven, former Lagos infrastructure manager, three years of practice, still skeptical, still showing up. "Hard. Mind went everywhere. Kept thinking about my daughter." Pause. "She'll be twenty-six when this ends. I kept seeing her face instead of noticing breath."

"That's practice," Kenji says. "Noticing what's actually here—including thoughts of people you love. You noticed. You didn't get lost. That's enough."

Chen Liwei adds quietly: "I counted breaths. Got to forty-three. Then realized counting was avoiding feeling. Stopped counting. Just felt. Fear, mostly. That was harder than counting."

"Yes," Kenji says. "Counting is technique. Feeling is practice. Both useful. Both necessary. Sometimes you need technique to build capacity. Sometimes you need to let technique go and just feel."

Kowalski: "Thirty-seven years I showed up to work I wasn't sure mattered. This feels similar. Showing up to practice I'm not sure helps. But I show up anyway. That's what I know how to do."

Several people nod. Recognition. Showing up is the practice. Not achieving. Not fixing. Just: here.

A young voice from the back. Thabo—fourteen years old, born Year 1, never knew pre-detection world. Brilliant, questioning, struggling. Their hand tentatively raised.

"Kenji, can I ask something?"

"Always."

The room goes quiet. Sixty people lean forward. Thabo's voice clear despite trembling: "Does this practice make dying easier?"

There it is. Everyone's question. The one they're all carrying. The one Kenji asks himself every morning.

He pauses. Considers lying. Offering comfort. Promising peace. The compassionate answer would be: yes, practice helps, you'll be ready, it gets easier.

But Wei taught him: honesty over comfort. Truth over consolation. Presence over bypassing.

"No," Kenji says. The word lands hard in the silence. "Death is hard regardless. This practice doesn't make death easier. It makes life clearer. Makes this moment fuller. Makes presence possible. It won't save anyone. It just lets you actually live the time you have."

Thabo nods slowly, processing. Their face shows disappointment and recognition both. "Is that enough?"

Kenji meets their eyes. Holds their gaze. This fourteen-year-old child about to die. This brilliant young person asking if clarity is worth it when clarity doesn't prevent pain.

"I don't know," Kenji admits. "Ask me in three months."

Silence. Long silence. Sixty people sitting with the honesty. The refusal to pretend. The acknowledgment that practice doesn't save anyone.

Then: laughter. It starts with Obi—a single bark of surprised recognition. Spreads to Chen, to Kowalski, to Elena. Dark humor. True humor. The laughter of people facing the same impossible question together. Thabo laughs too, tension breaking. They're all in this. All practicing. All learning to die awake even though awake means scared.

The laughter fades into silence again. But different silence. Lighter. More honest.

Maya hasn't moved. Kenji watches her process his words. Sees something click in her face. Understanding. She won't be ready to die. No one will. But she can be present while dying. That's different. That's possible. That's what she's learning.

"Thank you," Thabo says quietly. "For not lying."

"You're welcome."

---

After practice, people linger. Not rushing out. Staying, talking, being together. Community forming around shared practice, shared questions, shared mortality.

Kenji facilitates but doesn't lead. Moves through the room, listening more than speaking. Watching connections form.

In one corner, Obi and David Chen are talking—first time they've really spoken. Kenji edges closer, curious.

"You maintained solar arrays fourteen years?" Obi asks.

"Yes," David says. Quiet as always. Present as always. "You?"

"Lagos water treatment. Nine years. Quit Year 10 when I realized everyone dies regardless."

David nods. No judgment. "I almost quit Year 7. Kept going because: what else? Despair?"

"Exactly." Obi leans forward. "Spent Year 10-11 despairing. Then came here, started practicing. Realized I was already practicing Years 1-10—through maintenance. Just didn't know it."

David smiles—rare expression for him. "Maintenance is meditation. Every connection checked. Every system tested. That's presence."

"You taught me that without teaching me." Obi's voice carries wonder. "Hearing about your arrays—I realized my Lagos work was sacred. Just didn't see it."

They sit in silence. Two engineers who maintained impossible systems until systems weren't needed anymore. Both understanding: the work mattered because they showed up. Not outcomes. Process. Presence.

Ibrahim joins them briefly. "I maintain arrays now. David taught me." He gestures at both. "You both taught me that systems can still function when they're falling apart. Bodies too. Faith too. All still capable of presence."

Three maintenance workers. Different systems. Same practice. Engineering as prayer. Work as witness.

Kenji watches them connect. Teaching happening naturally. Not through him—through shared experience. Through recognition. This is how transmission works when it's real.

In another corner, Barak Naveh sits with three young people struggling. One veteran with visible tremor. One parent whose child won't stop crying. One teenager—Thabo again—wrestling with existential terror.

Barak doesn't give advice. Just sits. Listens. His presence solid, grounded, calm. When the veteran's hand shakes uncontrollably, Barak places his own hand steady on the table—not touching, just present.

"My hand shakes too sometimes," Barak says quietly. "After years inside. Body remembers confinement. Presence doesn't fix it. Just holds it."

The veteran nods. The crying child calms. Thabo asks: "How do you sit with fear?"

"I don't make it go away. I just don't run. That's all. Staying is enough."

Simple. Grounded. True. People around him settle into their own experience, permission granted to be exactly where they are.

Kenji moves on. Lets the teaching happen. Watches Obi and David and Ibrahim connecting over maintenance. Watches Barak teaching through stable presence. Different paths. Same understanding. They're all teaching what he teaches, but through their own languages.

Valuable. Real.

Wei's teaching spreading not because he's replicating her exactly, but because the truth she pointed to is discoverable from infinite directions. Maintenance. Steadiness. Presence. Faith and faithlessness both. All of it pointing toward the same thing.

The room gradually empties. People leaving with quiet goodbyes, plans to return, gratitude. Sixty people down to thirty, to twenty, to ten.

Maya lingers briefly. Catches his eye across the room. She'd asked him yesterday for intensive training—daily sessions, everything he knows, ninety days. He'd agreed. They start tomorrow at six AM.

She doesn't need to say anything now. Just: acknowledgment. Gratitude in her expression. Then she leaves with her family.

Alone now. Kenji remains in the empty space. Cushions scattered. The smell of sixty people—sweat, breath, humanity. All temporary. All precious.

He starts straightening cushions. Simple task. Meditation through action. Wei taught him this—cleaning as practice, tidying as presence. The work doesn't matter for its outcome. Matters for the doing.

As he works, something shifts. He notices he's not thinking about tomorrow's session with Maya. Not planning curriculum. Not worrying about qualification. Just: straightening cushions. Completely absorbed.

Then he realizes: when Thabo asked if practice makes dying easier, he didn't reach for Wei's words. Didn't reach for doctrine. Didn't reach for the right thing to say. Just the true thing. No teacher, no student. Just the moment answering itself.

An empty circle. No performance. No separation between the teaching and the being.

He stands very still. Cushion in hands.

Wei had always said she was somewhere around Picture Six or Seven, never beyond. Most people never get past chasing the ox. Somehow, through teaching, through stopping the search, something else arrived. Not an achievement. Just presence without trying.

Kenji finishes straightening cushions. Doesn't tell anyone about the recognition. Doesn't need to. Whatever this is, it isn't a badge. It's just how he moves now.

He locks the community center. Walks home through Antarctic evening. Polar summer means sunlight even at eight PM. The city sprawls around him—one point eight million people, all counting down.

Tomorrow: the first intensive session with Maya. Ninety mornings. Everything he knows offered in three months. She'll absorb what she can. Let go of the rest. But she'll die awake. Present. Clear.

That's his gift to her. Wei's gift through him. The transmission continuing.

Wei → Kenji → Maya. Three generations. Same wisdom.

---

His apartment is small. Functional. One room, shared bathroom down the hall. He's lived here three years—since returning to Antarctica. Before that: Wei's garden in Lagos. Before that: wandering. Before that: the dissertation he never finished, the deflection expertise that became useless.

Kenji makes tea. Wei's method—precise temperature, careful timing. The making itself is meditation. Not preparation for something else. Complete in itself.

He sits at the small table. Drinks the tea. Thinks about Maya.

Seventeen years old. Three months left. Wants to learn everything. Impossible request. Impossible timeline. But they'll try anyway.

Not because it will work. Because it's what there is to do.

The tea is good. Simple green tea, synthesized but close enough to real. He drinks slowly. Savoring. Not because tomorrow is uncertain—tomorrow is certain. Everyone dies. But because this tea, this moment, this presence—it's here now. Real now.

After tea, Kenji prepares for bed. Brushes teeth. Changes clothes. Simple routines that ground him. Wei taught him this too—sacred in the mundane. Enlightenment in ordinary actions.

He sits on his meditation cushion—the same cushion Wei gave him Year 9. Worn now. Compressed from six years of practice. But still functional. Still here.

Kenji closes his eyes. Returns to breath.

One.

Two.

Tomorrow: first intensive session. Six AM. Begin transmitting what can't be taught, only discovered.

Three.

Four.

Wei died well. Conscious until the end. Present to her own dying. That's what Kenji wants for Maya. Not peace. Not acceptance. Just: awareness. Presence. Being awake for her final moments even if awake means terrified.

Five.

Six.

He's ready? No. Present? Yes. That's the same answer he gave Thabo. Not ready, but present. Not certain, but here.

Seven.

Eight.

Teaching presence until he can't. Teaching Maya until she can't learn. Then: physics. Then: silence. But these ninety days—complete.

Nine.

Ten.

Breath continues. Body breathes. Mind quiets slightly. The apartment silent except for breathing and the distant hum of failing infrastructure—power grid degrading, water systems strained, everything maintained just barely. David's arrays still functioning. Testament to persistence. Everything working just long enough.

Fifteen.

Twenty.

Kenji's breath slows. Practice settling him. Not achieving anything. Just: here. Present. Clear.

He thinks about the moment in the community center. The recognition. Responding without reaching. Teaching without performing.

Wei would be proud. Not because he achieved something. Because he stopped seeking achievement and found presence instead.

Tomorrow begins the ninety days. Maya's intensive training. Her final months spent learning what can't be taught, only discovered. He'll point. She'll look. The transmission will happen or it won't. Either way: complete.

Thirty.

Kenji opens his eyes. The apartment is quiet. Antarctic evening light filtering through the small window. Three months until everyone in this building dies. Three months until the city vaporizes. Three months until consciousness ends and the universe continues without humans to witness it.

But today—today he taught sixty people. Today Thabo asked the hard question. Today Ibrahim helped. Today community formed. Today presence happened.

That's enough. That has to be enough. There's nothing else.

Kenji stands. Prepares for bed. Tomorrow: six AM. First intensive session with Maya.

He lies down. Closes his eyes. Breath continues without effort. Body relaxing into sleep. Mind quiet enough.

The last thought before sleep: *Ninety days. Make them count. Make them presence. Make them home.*

Then: darkness. Rest. The preparation for tomorrow's teaching already complete because there is no preparation. Just: showing up. Being present. Transmitting what Wei gave him to Maya who will die at seventeen but will die awake.

That's the practice. That's the point. Not immortality. Transmission. Person to person.

Until the end.
