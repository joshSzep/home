# Chapter 38: Legacy

**Kenji Torres | Year 12, Month 3 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia had no petals left.

Kenji knelt beside it in Wei's garden—*the* garden now, he supposed, though calling it his felt wrong—and studied the bare stem. Yesterday: three white petals clinging. This morning: scattered on the soil below. He picked one up. Paper-thin. Brown at the edges. Already composting.

Six months. Six months since Wei died and Kenji became the person people came to for teaching. Six months of holding space he didn't feel qualified to hold. Six months of hearing Wei's voice in his own words and wondering if he was channeling wisdom or performing memory.

The lemon tree needed water. He filled the can from the rain barrel—Zara had maintained the system perfectly, everything functioning as Wei had designed it—and watered slowly. Fifty-two years old, this tree. Wei had grown it from seed in Beijing, transported it through three moves, four cities, one lifetime. In three years it would burn. But today it needed water.

That was practice. That was what Wei taught him. Water the tree not because watering saves it. Because today it's thirsty.

"Uncle Kenji?"

He turned. Maya stood in the doorway, backpack over her shoulder, that same fierce seriousness she'd had since she was small. Thirteen years, eight months old now. Nearly fourteen. Six months since she'd awakened in this garden, one week after Wei's death. Six months since everything changed for her.

"Good morning, Maya. You're early."

"I wanted to talk before the others come."

Kenji set down the watering can. Gestured to the bench—Wei's bench, where he'd sat that first morning three and a half years ago, exhausted from six years of seeking, ready to stop. Where Wei had asked him to stay. To learn nothing. To water plants.

Maya sat. Kenji beside her. The morning was warm and bright—Lagos District's engineered tropical climate predictable as mathematics. Below them, five million people beginning another day in Year 12. Three years left. Everything temporary. Everything here now.

"What did you want to talk about?"

Maya pulled out a notebook. Opened it. Kenji saw pages filled with precise handwriting—notes from the teaching sessions she'd been attending. Six months of twice-weekly gatherings. Maya sitting in back, practicing with fierce concentration, absorbing everything.

"I've been coming to your teachings for six months," Maya said. "Twenty-six sessions. I've practiced daily—meditation, presence exercises, noticing practice. I read everything Grandmother Wei wrote that Mama has. I understand the philosophy intellectually. Impermanence, no-self, the nature of consciousness. But—"

She paused. Choosing words carefully.

"But understanding isn't the same as embodying. I know this. You've said it. Wei said it. I can explain presence perfectly. I can't *be* present consistently. There's a gap. And I have less than four years left. Three years, seven months, thirteen days." Her voice was steady, matter-of-fact. "I'll die at seventeen years, seven months old. That's not enough time to waste."

Kenji's chest tightened. This child—not quite child anymore, something else, something between—speaking about her own death with such precision. Such clarity. Such fierce determination not to waste the brief time remaining.

"So I'm asking," Maya continued, meeting his eyes directly. "Can I study with you? Like you studied with Wei? Formally. Intentionally. Not just attending sessions. Actually learning everything. Everything she would have taught me if she'd lived."

The question landed in Kenji's chest like recognition. Like inevitability. Like Wei's voice saying: *This is why you stayed. This is why you learned. This is transmission.*

"Maya—" He didn't know how to finish.

"I know I'm young," she said quickly. "I know thirteen is early for this kind of study. But I don't have time to wait until I'm older. Wei died when I was thirteen. That was my awakening. I can't go back to being a child who doesn't know. I've seen death. I understand impermanence. Not intellectually—viscerally. I felt Wei leave. I felt consciousness end. I can't unsee that."

Kenji recognized himself in her words. Recognized the desperation, the urgency, the sense that time was running out and seeking couldn't be postponed. But also: recognized something different. Maya wasn't seeking to escape. She was seeking to be present. Seeking to live her brief life fully. That was wisdom he'd taken six years to find.

"Why do you want to study with me?" he asked. "What do you think I can teach you?"

Maya considered. "You learned from Wei. You carry what she knew. But also—you struggled. Mama told me. You spent years seeking, couldn't find answers, almost gave up. Then you found Wei and learned presence. That matters to me. I don't need a perfect teacher. I need an honest teacher. Someone who remembers being lost."

The words hit precisely. Kenji felt tears rising. Wei's voice in memory: *Qualified teachers teach knowledge. Unqualified teachers teach presence. You're perfect.*

"I'm not enlightened," he said quietly. "I'm still learning. Still practicing. Still failing regularly."

"I know. That's why I'm asking you. Perfect teachers are intimidating. Struggling teachers are human."

Kenji laughed—startled, genuine. "Wei would have loved that distinction."

"She made it to me once. Year 7, I think. I asked her if she was enlightened. She said: 'I'm 122 years old and still practicing. Enlightenment is practice, not achievement. Anyone claiming to be done learning is lying or deluded.' Then she showed me how to deadhead the gardenias."

That was Wei entirely. Philosophy through gardening. Teaching through tasks. Enlightenment as verb, not noun.

"Okay," Kenji said. "Yes. I'll teach you everything I know."

"Really?" Maya's careful composure cracked into excitement. "You mean it?"

"I mean it. But understand: it won't be enough. Three years, seven months isn't enough time to master anything. We'll barely scratch the surface. You'll die with questions unanswered, practices incomplete, understanding partial."

"That's okay." Maya's voice was steady again. "Wei lived 125 years and said the same thing. Duration doesn't matter. Presence matters. If I die at seventeen but spent my time awake, really awake—that's worth more than eighty years asleep."

"Where did you learn that?"

"From watching Mama. From Wei's letters. From your teaching. From—" She gestured at the garden. "From this. The gardenias bloom for three days. They don't need seventy years. They just need to bloom fully while they're here."

Kenji felt something shift in his chest. Not pride exactly. More like: recognition. Wei's teaching spreading. Person to person. Wei to Zara to Maya. Wei to Kenji to Maya. Multiple transmission lines converging. The teaching wasn't dying. It was multiplying.

"When do we start?" Maya asked.

"We already started. This conversation is teaching. Your question is practice. Being here fully—that's everything."

Maya smiled. "That sounds like something Wei would say."

"I know. She lives through the teaching. That's how transmission works. Person to person. Until there are no persons left."

They sat quietly. The lemon tree stood patient. The gardenias—some blooming, some fading, some not yet opened—continued their cycle. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything teaching.

"Can I ask another question?" Maya said.

"Always."

"Do you feel ready? To teach? Six months after Wei died—do you feel qualified?"

Kenji took a breath. Honest answer. "No. I feel like I'm performing her teaching without fully understanding it. Like I'm channeling her voice instead of finding my own. Like I'm fraudulent."

"But you keep teaching anyway."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because people come seeking. Because I have something to offer even if it's incomplete. Because Wei asked me to continue. Because—" He paused, finding the real answer. "Because teaching is how I learn. Every time I facilitate a session, every time I respond to someone's question, I understand a little more. Teaching isn't something I do after mastering the material. Teaching *is* the mastering."

Maya wrote this down in her notebook. Kenji watched her careful handwriting. Precise. Complete. Just like her aunt Amara. Just like her own brilliant, serious, brief self.

"One more question," Maya said. "The hardest one."

"Go ahead."

"How do you live knowing I'll die so young? That everyone in your teaching circle will die? That everything you're building ends in three years? How do you keep showing up?"

The question was Wei's question. Elena's question. The question everyone carried. How do you live the ending?

"I don't know," Kenji admitted. "Every day I wake up and think: why bother? Why teach presence when everyone dies? Why build community when community ends? Why care when caring means losing? And every day I don't have good answers. But I get up anyway. Come to this garden. Water the plants. Facilitate the sessions. Respond to seekers. Not because it saves anyone. Because it's what there is to do."

"Is that enough?"

"It has to be. There's nothing else."

Maya absorbed this. Wrote it down. Then closed her notebook. "Okay. Thank you. That's what I needed to know. That you don't have it figured out either. That you show up anyway. That's the teaching I need."

---

The teaching session started at 9 AM. Twice-weekly gathering. Tuesdays and Fridays. Wei's garden couldn't hold everyone anymore—twenty-three people today—so they'd expanded to Zara's apartment and the courtyard below. But they always began here. In the garden. Where Wei taught. Where the practice started.

Kenji watched them arrive. Familiar faces mostly. Adaeze with her daughter Chioma—the woman who'd come six months ago asking how to love a child who'd die young. She attended every session now. Brought Chioma. Both practicing presence together.

Chen Liwei and his wife Mei—the former UN Secretary General, sixty-four years old now, learning that witness was his life's work all along. He'd started attending Year 11, Month 2. Ten months now. Quiet, thoughtful, always listening more than speaking.

Yuki—twenty-nine, Japanese, the seeker Kenji had known in Mumbai three years ago. She'd arrived in Lagos six months ago, still desperately seeking enlightenment. Still practicing with fierce intensity. Still learning that seeking itself was obstacle.

Newer faces too. A Brazilian priest—Father Tomás, fifty-eight, faith shattered Year 1, seeking replacement. Kenji had met him in Mumbai, lost track of him, found him again here. Both wanderers finding temporary home.

A young Nigerian engineer named Chidi. An elderly Indian woman named Priya. A teenage boy—seventeen, dying soon—who came because his mother made him but kept coming because something here helped.

And Obi. Forty-two. Former Lagos District infrastructure manager. He'd been coming for two months now, always sitting with arms crossed, always looking skeptical. He never spoke. Just: watched. Judged. Kenji could feel the resistance radiating off him.

And Maya, sitting in back like always. But different now. Not just attending. Studying. Learning. Committed.

Zara brought tea. Kofi helped distribute cups—ten years, seven months old, still joyful despite understanding. He moved among the seekers with natural ease, offering tea and small kindnesses. That was presence too. That was practice.

When everyone had tea, when the courtyard was full, Kenji rang the small bell Wei had used. The sound was clear and simple. Everyone settled.

"Good morning," Kenji said. Not performing. Just: greeting. "Thank you for coming. For showing up. For being present even when presence is difficult."

He'd learned this from Wei. Start by honoring the showing up. Start by acknowledging that being here matters.

"Six months ago, Professor Wei died. Some of you knew her. Some knew her only through me, or through others she taught. But all of you carry something she offered—whether directly or through transmission. The teaching doesn't die when the teacher dies. It continues. Through us. Through practice. Through this."

He gestured at the gathered circle. Twenty-three people. Ages seven to seventy-four. Nigerian, Japanese, Indian, Brazilian, Chinese, American. Children and elders. Believers and skeptics. Seekers and teachers. All here because something in them recognized: presence matters. Being here matters. Living fully in the time remaining matters.

"Today I want to talk about transmission," Kenji continued. "How teaching spreads. Person to person. Wei taught me. I teach you. You teach others. The cycle continues. But transmission isn't just information transfer. It's presence passing to presence. Being seeing being. One human helping another human wake up."

He saw Maya taking notes. Saw Chen nodding slowly. Saw Adaeze holding Chioma close.

"Wei used to say: I teach you nothing. But I sit with you while you learn. That's what we do here. I don't have answers about mortality. About how to face extinction. About how to live three years fully. But I have practice. I have presence. I have this garden and these sessions and the understanding that being here together—that's enough. That's everything."

"But is it?" The voice came from Yuki. Sharp. Challenging. "Is presence enough? We're going to die. All of us. What does presence accomplish? How does it help?"

Kenji felt the familiar doubt rise. The question he asked himself daily. The question he couldn't answer satisfactorily. But Wei's voice in memory: *Don't teach answers. Teach questions. Teach: we're figuring this out together.*

"I don't know," Kenji said honestly. "Presence doesn't prevent death. Doesn't make dying peaceful. Doesn't accomplish anything measurable. But—" He paused, finding the words. "Presence changes relationship to what is. You're going to die. I'm going to die. We can spend our remaining time terrified, numb, distracted. Or we can spend it awake. Present. Fully here. Neither option changes the outcome. But one option means we actually lived. The other means we waited for death while missing life."

"So presence is for us," Tomás said quietly. "Not for outcome. For experience."

"Yes. The practice doesn't save anyone. But it makes the time we have real. Complete. Fully experienced instead of half-avoided."

"Bullshit."

The word landed hard. Everyone turned. Obi—arms still crossed, face tight with anger. He'd finally spoken.

"Excuse me?" Kenji felt his chest tighten defensively.

"This is bullshit," Obi repeated. "Spiritual bypassing. You're telling us to be present so we feel better about extinction. Like meditation fixes anything. Like sitting in this garden and talking about presence changes the fact that we're all going to burn. That our children are going to burn. That everything humanity built for three thousand years burns. And you want us to be *present* to it?"

The circle was silent. Kenji felt heat rising in his face. Felt the urge to defend. To argue. To prove Obi wrong.

"I'm not saying—" he started.

"Yes you are. You're saying acceptance. Presence. Being here now. Like that's wisdom. But maybe it's just giving up. Maybe presence is what people do when they can't fight anymore. When they're too tired to rage. You call it enlightenment. I call it surrender."

Kenji opened his mouth. Closed it. His mind was scrambling. Wei would know how to respond. Wei would stay calm. Wei would turn this into teaching. But Kenji wasn't Wei.

"You don't know what you're talking about," Kenji said, and immediately regretted it. Too defensive. Too sharp. Not presence. Reaction.

"Don't I?" Obi leaned forward. "I spent nine years managing infrastructure for five million people. Keeping systems running. Fighting collapse. Actually *doing* something. Then Year 10 I realized: pointless. All of it. The asteroid doesn't care how well I maintain the water treatment. So I quit. Came here because someone said this teaching might help. But it's just pretty words about impermanence. Just another way to make meaninglessness feel meaningful."

Kenji's face was hot. His hands were shaking slightly. He was failing. Right here. In front of everyone. In front of Maya.

"I—" He stopped. Took a breath. Another. Wei's voice: *When you don't know what to say, say that.*

"I don't know how to respond to you," Kenji said finally. Voice unsteady. "You're right that presence doesn't fix anything. Doesn't save anyone. And maybe you're right that it's surrender. I don't know. I spent six years trying to figure this out and I'm still not sure. All I know is: showing up here feels better than not showing up. Practicing feels better than not practicing. Presence feels better than numbness. Maybe that's surrender. Maybe it's the only wisdom left. I don't know."

Obi stared at him. The circle was silent.

Maya raised her hand. Kenji nodded at her, grateful for interruption.

"Uncle Kenji, you said transmission is presence passing to presence. But how? How does watching you teach presence teach me presence? Isn't it something I have to discover myself?"

"Yes and no." Kenji smiled. "Yes, you have to practice. I can't give you my presence. But I can show you what practice looks like. I can create space where presence becomes possible. I can reflect back what you already know but can't see. That's transmission. Not giving you something new. Helping you recognize what's already here."

Chen spoke up. "Mayor Torres in Antarctica wrote me last month. She said you're her son. Said you spent six years seeking what she'd already found—showing up. Being present. Witnessing. Different paths to same understanding."

Kenji felt warmth in his chest. His mother. Still governing. Still showing up. Still practicing Picture Nine without knowing the framework. Always home. Never lost.

"My mother teaches presence through governance," Kenji said. "I teach through these sessions. Wei taught through gardening. Everyone transmits differently. But the teaching is the same: be here now. That's all. That's everything."

The session continued. Questions emerged. Kenji responded—sometimes with answers, more often with questions back. Creating space for people to discover their own understanding. Wei's method. Facilitating, not instructing.

Adaeze asked: "How do I explain death to my daughter? She's six. She knows she'll die at twelve. How do I make that bearable?"

Kenji remembered this moment from six months ago. His first teaching. When Wei had watched him respond. When doubt lifted because there was specific person needing specific help.

"You don't make it bearable," he said gently. "You bear it with her. You be present to her fear and your fear. You love her completely while you can. You don't fix it—you can't fix it. You witness it together."

Adaeze was crying. "That's what you said six months ago. It helped then. It helps now. But it's so hard."

"Yes. It's impossibly hard. The practice doesn't make it easy. Makes it possible to keep showing up."

Chen asked: "I governed for eight years trying to coordinate humanity. Failed completely. Nations ignored me. Authority eroded. I thought I was useless. Wei taught me I was witnessing. That witness was the work. Is that true? Does bearing witness matter if no one reads the record?"

"The record isn't the point," Kenji said. "Being present to what was happening—that's the point. You showed up. You tried. You bore witness to humanity's final response to extinction. That mattered. Still matters. Will always have mattered even after everyone who knows about it dies."

The young teenager spoke—rare for him. "Everyone says make the time count. But how? How do I make my remaining time count when I'll never finish anything? Never become anything? Never accomplish anything?"

Kenji felt the question personally. The boy was asking what Kenji had asked for six years. What Maya asked. What everyone here asked. How do you live abbreviated lives?

"You don't make them count," Kenji said slowly. "You live them. Fully. Presently. Being completely here is worth more than being half-asleep. The counting—measuring, evaluating, comparing to some imagined full life—that's suffering. Just: be here. That's enough. That's everything."

"But I want more time!"

"Of course you do. Everyone does. The wanting is appropriate. The grief is real. But the wanting doesn't change anything. Only changes how you spend the time you have. Wanting what can't be. Or accepting what is and being present to it."

The boy was crying. Others were crying. Kenji's eyes were wet too.

"Maybe Obi's right," the boy said through tears. "Maybe that's just surrender."

Kenji looked at Obi. Then back at the boy. "Maybe it is. I don't know anymore. Wei taught me this practice. Said it would help. And it does help—some days. Other days I wake up and think: what's the point? Why bother? Maybe practicing presence when extinction is coming is just elaborate denial. Maybe rage would be more honest."

"Then why do you keep teaching?" Adaeze asked quietly.

Kenji took a breath. Honest answer. "Because I don't know what else to do. This is what I have. Presence. Practice. This circle. Maybe it's surrender. Maybe it's wisdom. Probably it's both. But it's better than being alone with the terror. Better than nothing. And some days—not every day—being here together feels like enough."

The silence was heavy. Not peaceful. Just: heavy. No one had answers. Not even the teacher.

"Can I say something?" It was Obi again. Voice quieter now. Less angry.

"Please," Kenji said.

"I'm still not convinced. Still think this might be spiritual bypassing. But—" He paused. "You admitting you don't know. That you're uncertain. That helped. More than the answers did. So maybe I'll keep coming. See if doubt practicing together is better than doubt alone."

Kenji nodded. "That's all I'm offering. Doubt together. Uncertainty together. Practice despite not being sure it matters. If that's enough, stay. If it's not, go with my blessing."

Obi didn't leave. Neither did anyone else. They sat together in the heavy silence. Practicing doubt. Practicing presence. Practicing being human together while waiting for extinction.

This work—this teaching—it wasn't about having answers. It was about sitting together with unanswerable questions. Being present to collective grief. Witnessing each other's pain without trying to fix it.

That was transmission. That was practice. That was love.

Maybe.

---

After the session, people lingered. Some tended the garden—watering, weeding, deadheading. Others sat in small groups talking. Obi stood alone by the lemon tree, not leaving but not joining either. The gathering had become community. Not by design. Just: by showing up repeatedly. By being present together. By practicing in proximity.

Maya helped Kenji clean up. Collecting cups. Folding chairs. The domestic care that followed teaching. Wei used to say: the cleanup is also practice. The ordinary tasks matter as much as profound discussion.

Kenji's hands were still shaking slightly. The confrontation with Obi had rattled him. He'd gotten defensive. Said the wrong things. Almost argued. Not Wei's way. Not skillful. Just: human reaction.

"That was hard," Maya said quietly.

"What was?"

"Obi challenging you. You getting defensive. Having to admit you don't know. But—" She paused. "That was the most important teaching today. Not the answers. The uncertainty. The honesty. You not pretending to be enlightened."

Kenji felt something crack open in his chest. Relief mixed with embarrassment. "I handled that badly. Got defensive. Shouldn't have—"

"No," Maya interrupted. "You handled it perfectly. You were human. You reacted. Then you caught yourself. Admitted uncertainty. That's what I want to learn. Not how to be perfect. How to be real."

Six months of doubt didn't dissolve. But shifted. Not because doubt resolved. Because Maya saw him clearly—flawed, uncertain, reactive—and chose to study with him anyway. Chose his unqualified teaching. Chose transmission from struggling teacher instead of perfect master.

"We start tomorrow," Kenji said. "Every day. Morning sessions with you before the group gatherings. Intensive study."

"Will it be enough?"

"No. But we'll try anyway."

Maya smiled. "That's very Zen."

"That's very honest."

They finished cleaning. The garden was quiet now. Most people gone. Obi had left without speaking again—Kenji didn't know if he'd return. Zara had taken Kofi home. The lemon tree stood in afternoon light. Fifty-two years old. Thirsty again tomorrow.

"Uncle Kenji?" Maya stood at the doorway. "Thank you. For saying yes. For being willing to teach me even though you doubt yourself. That means everything."

"Thank you for asking. For choosing me. For—" He paused. "For carrying this forward. Wei's teaching doesn't end with me. Passes through me to you. That's transmission. That's legacy. That's everything."

Maya left. Kenji sat alone in Wei's garden—in the garden, just the garden, belonging to itself—and felt: grief, gratitude, purpose, doubt, clarity, confusion. All tangled together. All real. All part of Picture Five. Still taming the ox. Still learning. Still practicing.

But also: teaching. Transmitting. Passing forward what Wei gave him. The teaching wouldn't outlast the asteroid. Nothing would. But for whatever time remained it would spread. Person to person. Kenji to Maya. Maya to others. Wei's wisdom blooming through multiple lives. Brief lives. Uncertain lives.

Maybe that was enough. Maybe that was legacy. Maybe that was the flower blooming.

He didn't know. But he'd show up tomorrow anyway.

He picked up the watering can. The mint needed water. The gardenias needed deadheading. The lemon tree needed attention. Tomorrow he'd water them again. Tomorrow Maya would arrive for her first formal lesson. Tomorrow the teaching circle would gather again.

Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. Three years of tomorrows. Then: nothing.

But today: everything. The garden blooming. The teaching spreading. The transmission continuing. Wei's voice alive in his words. His presence teaching presence. Maya learning. The circle holding.

Today was enough.

Today was everything.

The flower bloomed.

That evening, Kenji wrote to his mother:

*Mom,*

*Year 12, Month 3 from Lagos. Something happened today. Something important.*

*Maya—Zara's daughter, thirteen years old, nearly fourteen—asked to study with me formally. Like I studied with Wei. She wants to learn everything in the three years, seven months she has left. Everything Wei would have taught her.*

*I said yes.*

*I'm terrified. Who am I to teach? I'm still learning. Still struggling. Still doubting everything. Today someone called the teaching bullshit. Said presence is just surrender. I got defensive. Said the wrong things. Had to admit I don't know if he's right. Maybe it IS surrender. Maybe practicing presence while extinction approaches is just elaborate denial.*

*But Maya said that's why she wants to learn from me. Because I'm honest about the difficulty. Because I remember being lost. Because struggling teachers are human. Because I don't pretend to have it figured out.*

*Wei used to say: qualified teachers teach knowledge. Unqualified teachers teach presence. I'm unqualified in the best way. I have no credentials. No mastery. No enlightenment. Just: practice. Presence. The willingness to show up daily and facilitate space for others to discover what I'm still discovering.*

*Mom, you do this too. You've been doing this longer than me. You govern without power. You maintain order without outcomes. You show up every morning to bear witness when witnessing changes nothing. That's Picture Nine—understanding home was always here. You never left. I wandered for six years seeking what you already had.*

*I'm teaching now. Really teaching. Not performing Wei's teaching. Becoming my own kind of teacher. Still learning. Still incomplete. Still making mistakes. But present. Honest. Available.*

*Twenty-three people came today. Twenty-three people seeking how to live their remaining time fully. I don't have answers. But I have practice. I have this garden. I have the understanding that being present together—maybe that's enough. Maybe that's everything. I'm not sure anymore. But I show up anyway.*

*Wei died six months ago. I've been teaching without her. At first it felt like betrayal—how dare I continue when she's gone? Today Maya helped me understand: Wei would want this. Want the teaching to spread. Want transmission to continue. Person to person. Until there are no persons. That's how wisdom works. That's how love works. That's legacy.*

*I'll teach Maya everything I know. Everything Wei taught me. It won't be enough. But we'll practice anyway. We'll be present anyway. We'll learn together anyway.*

*That's all anyone can do. Show up. Practice. Love what we'll lose. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's everything. Maybe it's just surrender. I don't know.*

*But I'll keep showing up.*

*Chen writes that you're still governing. Still holding briefings. Still maintaining dignity. I'm so proud of you. You're living Picture Nine. You're home. You always were.*

*I love you. I'll keep teaching. You keep witnessing. Together, separately, we practice. That's enough.*

*Your son,*  
*Kenji*

*P.S. - The lemon tree still blooms. Wei's garden still grows. The teaching continues. That's legacy. That's what matters.*

He sealed the letter. Set it aside for morning transport. 

Outside, Lagos District settled into evening. Five million people living Year 12. Everyone continuing their practice—whatever that practice was. Engineering. Parenting. Governance. Teaching. Maintenance. Tending dogs. Growing mint. Swimming despite broken bodies. Signing to each other in silence. Hosting dinners for refugees. All of it: practice. All of it: presence. All of it: legacy spreading person to person until persons ended.

Or maybe not legacy. Maybe just: what there was to do. Kenji didn't know anymore.

He sat in Wei's apartment—the apartment Zara maintained, open to him whenever needed—and felt: not complete. Not enlightened. Not certain. Just: here. Present. Real. Human.

Six months ago Wei died. Today Maya asked to learn. Today Obi called the teaching bullshit. Today Kenji got defensive and had to admit he didn't know. Tomorrow teaching would continue. Eventually everything would end.

But right now: the flower bloomed.

Or maybe it didn't. Maybe it was already dying. Maybe bloom and death were always simultaneous.

Right now was all there ever was. That much, at least, was true.

He'd show up tomorrow and see.
