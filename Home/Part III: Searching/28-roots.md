# Chapter 28: Roots

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 9, Month 3 | Lagos District**

---

The transport schedule updates: twelve minutes to arrival.

Zara checks it again. Still twelve minutes. Time moving with the peculiar elasticity of anticipation—simultaneously crawling and accelerating toward a moment she's been imagining for nineteen months.

Nineteen months since Amara finally called. Nineteen months of weekly conversations rebuilding what seven years of silence had fractured. Two brief visits in that time—awkward, tentative, both sisters learning how to be sisters again. But this is different. Two weeks. Extended stay. Family integration. The real test of whether connection survives proximity.

"Mama, you're nervous." Maya looks up from her physics book—advanced orbital mechanics, university level, which she reads like entertainment. Eleven years and three months old and already seeing patterns everyone else misses. Like her aunt. Like both her mother's engineering and her aunt's astrophysics flowing together in one brilliant, serious child.

"I'm excited," Zara corrects. "That's different."

"It's the same autonomic response. Elevated heart rate. Sweating. Hypervigilance. Your engineering brain categorizes it differently, but physiologically—"

"Maya." Zara smiles despite herself. "Let me be nervous."

"Okay, Mama." Maya returns to her book, but Zara catches the small smile. Her daughter is nervous too, hiding it in precision and facts. Wanting to impress the famous scientist aunt. Wanting to be seen as brilliant, worthy, interesting. As if she's anything less.

Kofi has no such restraint. Eight years and five months old, all motion and enthusiasm, he bounces on the arrival hall bench for the fifteenth time. "When? When, Mama? You said morning and it's morning and—"

"Ten minutes now. See?" Zara points to the schedule display.

"That's forever!"

"It's six hundred seconds."

"That's still forever!"

Zara pulls him onto her lap—getting harder as he grows, all elbows and knees and unstoppable energy. He settles for exactly eight seconds before squirming. "Tell me again about Aunt Amara."

"I've told you a hundred times."

"Tell me a hundred and one!"

So Zara tells him again, the same story she's been telling since she called Amara back nineteen months ago: Your Aunt Amara is my big sister. She's a scientist who studies the sky. She lives in Antarctica where it's very cold. She was sad for a long time and far away, but now she's coming to visit. She wants to know you. She wants to be your aunt.

What Zara doesn't tell him: She calculated your death before you were born and then disappeared into numbers for seven years. She missed your birth, your first words, your first day of school. She sent you nothing—no messages, no gifts, no acknowledgment you existed. She chose isolation over family because feeling anything hurt too much.

But that was then. People change. People thaw. Amara is trying.

That's enough. Has to be enough. Is enough.

The arrival board updates: eight minutes.

---

Lagos District morning wraps around them like warm water—engineered tropical climate, bright and humid and relentlessly alive. Through the arrival hall windows, Zara sees the megacity waking: five million people beginning another day in Year 9, with less than six years remaining. Still building. Still working. Still living. The persistence is remarkable. Or delusional. Or both. Or neither—just: what life does. Continue until it can't.

The compound rooftop garden is visible from here, a green crown on their building three kilometers away. The expansion they voted on in Year 6 is complete now—one hundred twenty square meters of growing space producing eighty percent of their vegetables. Planted three years ago. Will feed them until impact. Then: vaporized. But today: thriving. That's enough.

That's what Wei taught her. That's what she's tried to teach her children. That's what she hopes Amara has learned: Temporary and valuable aren't opposites. They're partners.

"Mama, you're doing it again." Maya's voice, patient and knowing.

"Doing what?"

"Cataloging variables. I can see your eyes moving. You're running scenarios."

Zara laughs. "You're too smart."

"I know." No false modesty. Just fact. "But Aunt Amara will be fine. You've talked to her every week for nineteen months. You've seen her twice. She's different now. You said so."

"I know."

"So why are you nervous?"

Because talking on screens is different from living in proximity. Because two brief visits aren't the same as two weeks of daily intimacy. Because what if the thawing was temporary? What if she retreats again? What if the children see their aunt disappear and learn that family is unreliable? What if—

"Because I love her," Zara says simply. "And love makes you nervous."

Maya considers this. "That's illogical but empirically accurate."

"Welcome to being human, baby."

"I don't think I like it."

"You get used to it."

Kofi has abandoned sitting entirely, pressing his face against the window watching for the transport. "Is that it? Is that it? No, that's cargo. Is THAT it?"

"That's passenger," Zara confirms. "That's the one."

The transport descends through Lagos District airspace—sleek white vehicle carrying two hundred passengers from Antarctica. Somewhere inside: Amara. And David, her ex-husband, now boyfriend, now something-being-rebuilt. Two broken people attempting reconnection after five years divorced. Attempting to show up. Attempting to be present.

Zara understands attempting. That's all anyone does. Attempt presence. Fail. Attempt again. The practice isn't perfection. It's returning.

The transport docks. Docking procedures. Security checks. Customs. Immigration. Ten minutes of bureaucracy between here and reunion.

Zara's heart rate elevates again. Maya's right—autonomic response, indistinguishable from fear. But she knows the difference. This isn't fear. This is hope. Fragile, terrifying, necessary hope that her sister is really here. Really choosing family. Really trying.

"Mama?" Kofi's hand finds hers. "Are you crying?"

"No, baby. Just—emotional."

"What's the difference?"

"There isn't one."

On the wall behind the schedule display, someone has hung one of the new prints making their way through the districts—a reproduction of an installation by Asha Marin, the extinction-era artist half the world seems to be arguing about this year. The piece is simple: a child-sized mannequin standing under a projected countdown clock, hands empty, face featureless. Some commentators call it blasphemous. Others call it compassionate. Zara just notices how every person who glances at it flinches in a slightly different way.

Maya studies it with clinical interest. "People keep saying it's controversial," she says. "But it's just light and plastic. The reaction is in them, not in it."

"Art's good at that," Zara replies. "Showing you what you brought into the room." She has no opinion on Asha beyond this: the work is a mirror. The world is terrified of mirrors right now.

Passengers emerge from customs. First wave: business travelers, engineers, maintenance workers rotating home from Antarctic duty. Second wave: families, researchers, the rare tourist who still travels despite everything. Third wave—

There.

Amara. Fifty-nine years old, gray-threaded hair, thin in the way of people who forget to eat. But present. Actually here. Not hiding in a monitoring station. Not vanishing into data. Here. With David beside her—fifty-eight, quiet, steady, both of them carrying small bags for two weeks' stay.

Sisters see each other across the arrival hall.

Nine years. Nine years older. Both changed. Both different from who they were when Maya was born and Amara missed it, when Kofi was born and Amara sent nothing, when Zara stopped trying and Amara kept isolating.

But also: same. Still sisters. Still carrying the same grandmother's eyes, the same stubborn Okafor determination, the same engineering brain that turns everything into solvable problems even when some problems don't solve.

Zara moves first. Has to. Amara is frozen, clearly terrified this won't work, that nine years of absence can't be bridged, that she's not welcome despite nineteen months of proof otherwise.

So Zara crosses the distance. Closes the gap. Opens her arms.

And Amara steps into them.

The embrace is full. Not tentative. Not careful. Full. Real. Sisters holding each other while Lagos District flows around them and less than six years tick toward zero and none of it matters because right now: together.

"You came," Zara hears herself say through tears she didn't plan on crying.

"I should have come sooner." Amara's voice is thick, breaking. "I'm so sorry. I should have—"

"You're here now. That's enough."

They hold each other and Zara feels nine years of grief and anger and fear dissolving. Not gone—you don't erase nine years in one embrace. But: releasing. Making space for something else. Something better. Something like forgiveness. Something like love continuing despite everything.

When they finally separate, both sisters crying, Zara sees David standing back with Maya and Kofi, giving them space. Her children watching, learning: this is what reconciliation looks like. This is what family choosing family looks like. This is what showing up means.

"Maya, Kofi—come meet your aunt."

Maya steps forward first, all seriousness and precision. She's rehearsed this. Zara can tell. Her daughter extends her hand formally: "Hello, Aunt Amara. I'm Maya. I'm very good at mathematics."

Amara's laugh is startled and genuine and wonderful. "I heard. Your mother says you're brilliant."

"She's correct." No false modesty. "I've read your papers on Near-Earth Object trajectory calculations. Your predictive modeling is exceptional. Though I think your Year 3 paper on gravitational perturbation effects could have been—"

"Maya," Zara interrupts gently. "Maybe don't critique your aunt's work in the first thirty seconds."

"Why not? She wants honest feedback. All scientists do."

Amara is smiling now, really smiling. "Actually, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Later. When we have time."

"Really?" Maya's careful composure cracks into excitement. "Because I have seventeen questions about your methodology and three suggested improvements and—"

"Later, baby." Zara puts a hand on her daughter's shoulder. "Let your aunt breathe."

Kofi has been hiding behind Zara, shy despite his earlier enthusiasm. But curiosity wins. It always does with him. He peeks around, looks up at Amara with huge dark eyes. "Are you from space?"

"No, from Antarctica."

"Is that the same?"

"Almost." Amara crouches to his level, and Zara sees her sister's uncertainty transform into something softer. "Antarctica is at the bottom of the world. Very cold. Very white. Lots of ice."

"Do you have gardens?"

"No. Not many. It's too cold."

"That's sad." Kofi's assessment is serious. "Everyone needs gardens. Professor Wei says so."

"Professor Wei is very wise."

"Do you know her?"

"I do. She writes me letters."

This is news that delights Kofi completely. "She writes Mama letters too! And Kenji! She writes everyone! She's—" He searches for the right word. "—important."

"She is," Amara agrees. "Very important."

Kofi studies his aunt for another moment, then makes his decision. He grabs her hand. "Want to see our compound? We have gardens on the roof! And I have a balcony garden! And there's a lemon tree that's older than Mama!"

"I would love that." Amara looks at Zara, something vulnerable in her expression. Permission? Reassurance? Gratitude that her nephew is choosing her?

All of it. Everything.

"Let's go home," Zara says.

---

David and Kwame find each other in the way of quiet men married to intense women—instant recognition, instant understanding, instant relief that they're not alone in this.

"Welcome." Kwame shakes David's hand. "You're the ex-husband?"

"Attempting to be the current boyfriend."

"How's that going?"

"Slowly. Carefully. Terrifyingly."

Kwame smiles. "Come. I'll make tea. The women can handle emotions. We'll handle beverages."

They disappear into the transport's family section, leaving Zara and Amara with the children. Maya holding Amara's other hand now, already explaining Lagos District's engineering—water reclamation, power systems, transit network. Kofi adding commentary about which parks have the best climbing trees and where his friend Samuel lives and how compound dinners work.

Zara watches her children absorb their aunt into the family as if she's always been there. As if nine years of absence don't matter. As if love is simple and immediate and doesn't require perfect presence.

Maybe it is. Maybe they understand something she's forgotten. Maybe children are closer to Wei's teaching: this moment. This moment. This moment. Nothing else exists.

The transport to their compound loads. Public transit, not private—Zara and Kwame choose shared systems, choose community infrastructure, choose collective solutions. The children have never been in a private vehicle. Don't know what they're missing. Don't need to.

Settling into seats, Kwame and David still deep in conversation about carpentry and maintenance and the meaning found in temporary work. Amara between Zara and the children, looking overwhelmed and happy and scared all at once. Normal. Human. Present.

"Aunt Amara." Maya pulls out her tablet. "Look. This is my project on orbital resonance. See how Jupiter's moons create—"

"Maya, let your aunt settle before the advanced physics."

"But she's an astrophysicist! She wants to see—"

"I do," Amara confirms. "Show me."

So Maya shows her. Kofi adds his own observations about moons looking like his friend Adanna's son Samuel's toy balls. David leans over to see. Kwame provides running commentary on his daughter's brilliance. Normal family chaos. Beautiful family chaos. The kind of chaos that only happens when people show up and stay present and let life be messy.

Zara sits back, watching. Her fractured family becoming whole. Her absent sister attempting presence. Her ex-brother-in-law fitting into their life. Her children teaching their aunt about things she already knows but pretending not to because that's what aunts do.

This. This is what she fought for when she chose to have Kofi. This presence. This mattering. This fierce love in the face of certain ending. Not despite impermanence. Because of it. Because temporary makes every moment infinite.

The transport glides through Lagos District. Past residential zones where ten million people once lived and five million now persist. Past green spaces where engineered nature thrives. Past buildings that were here before the asteroid and will be here until impact. Past everything temporary and everything valuable.

"There!" Kofi points out the window. "See that building with the gardens? That's ours!"

The compound rises before them—fifty units, two hundred residents, rooftop thick with green. Home. Real home. Where Zara planted roots nine years ago and they've grown deep enough now to support new growth. To support her sister's return. To support family choosing family despite everything.

---

The apartment is exactly as Zara left it an hour ago—seventy square meters of beautiful chaos. Children's drawings cover walls. Engineering schematics glow on the kitchen table. Plants everywhere—Kwame's obsession, his way of bringing life into manufactured space. The balcony garden visible through open doors, Wei's wheelchair positioned there, old woman tending flowers with shaking hands while Ling helps.

Amara stops in the doorway, taking it all in.

Zara sees her apartment through her sister's eyes: Evidence of life lived. Photos of Maya as a baby, toddler, child. Photos of Kofi's birth, first steps, first day of school—all the moments Amara missed. Community gatherings. Compound dinners. Wei's garden sessions. Family accumulating meaning through ordinary moments photographed and displayed.

"You built something real," Amara says quietly.

"We did."

"While I was calculating—"

"While you were surviving. We all survived differently."

"But you survived by living. I survived by hiding."

"Yes." No point denying it. "But you're here now."

Amara touches a photo—Kofi at three years old, covered in soil from Wei's garden, laughing with dirt-stained hands. "I missed so much."

"You did."

"I can't get it back."

"No. You can't. But you have less than six years to be here now. Almost six years to be their aunt. That's not nothing."

Amara looks at Zara, eyes shining. "Is it enough?"

Zara thinks of Wei's teaching. Of flowers blooming and fading. Of lemon trees fruiting and resting. Of everything temporary and everything valuable. Of nine years of compound life teaching her that enough is whatever you have if you're present to it.

"Nothing's ever enough if you think it should be permanent," Zara says. "But it's what we have. And that makes it enough."

Kofi interrupts by barreling into Amara's legs, hugging her knees. "Come see my room! I have drawings! And rocks! And a book about butterflies from Professor Wei!"

Amara lets herself be pulled down the hall. Maya follows, already explaining her own room's organization system. David and Kwame emerge from the kitchen with tea, setting cups on the table and returning to their conversation like they've known each other for years instead of hours.

Zara stands in her living room listening to her family exist. Her children showing their aunt their lives. Her husband welcoming her sister's boyfriend. Ordinary sounds. Life sounds. Real sounds.

She moves to the balcony. Wei is still there, Ling helping her water gardenias. The old woman looks up—119 years old, body failing visibly, but mind sharp as ever.

"She came." Wei's voice is thin but clear.

"She did."

"Good. Family matters."

"You taught us that."

"I taught nothing. You learned everything." Wei returns to her watering. "The lemon tree needs water. The absent one can help tomorrow. Bring her to the garden. Dawn. We'll tend together."

"She'd like that."

"Everyone likes tending. They just forget until reminded." Wei finishes watering, lets Ling push her wheelchair back toward her own apartment next door. "Almost six years left, Zara. You chose well—roots instead of fear. Your sister is learning. Still learning. But learning."

Then she's gone, Ling wheeling her inside, leaving Zara alone with the garden that taught her everything. The lemon tree stands patient—fifty-two years old, will die at fifty-eight when the asteroid arrives. Same age Kofi will be. Same certainty. Same beauty despite ending.

Everything temporary. Everything valuable.

Behind her, inside her home, her family continues. Laughter from the children's rooms. Kwame and David's conversation drifting through. Life accumulating meaning through presence.

Zara waters the herbs Wei left untended. Mint and basil and rosemary growing. The garden doesn't know about the asteroid. Just grows because that's what plants do. Reach toward light. Put down roots. Bloom when conditions allow. Simple presence. Simple purpose. Simple enough.

---

Dinner is compound tradition—communal meal in the shared workspace, twenty families contributing food. Zara brings synth-protein curry. Kwame brings fresh bread from their morning baking. The children bring excitement and noise and energy.

Amara and David bring uncertainty but willingness. Good enough.

The workspace is full—forty people, five long tables, the organized chaos of community feeding itself. Mr. Okonkwo presides from the head table, eighty years old and still commanding presence through steady competence. Adanna moves between tables with her son Samuel, now nine, making sure everyone has enough. Tom sits with other engineers, deep in conversation about the water reclamation system.

"This is beautiful," Amara whispers to Zara as they find seats. "You built this?"

"We built it. All of us. Year by year. Starting Year 2 when everyone was still panicking. We chose to gather instead of isolate. Chose to eat together instead of apart. Chose community."

"In Antarctica, we scattered. Everyone alone in their apartments."

"I know." Zara squeezes her sister's hand. "But you don't have to be alone anymore. You're here. You're part of this. For two weeks. For however long you stay."

The meal flows. Conversation rises and falls. Children play between tables. Maya gravitates toward other children, sharing her knowledge. Kofi sticks close to Amara, determined not to lose his new aunt. David and Kwame continue their conversation, now including Tom and two other engineers discussing maintenance philosophy.

Adanna stops by their table. "Zara. Good to see you." Her eyes move to Amara. "This is the sister?"

"Amara. My big sister. Visiting from Antarctica."

"Welcome. We've heard about you."

Amara looks uncertain. "Good things?"

"Honest things. Zara doesn't hide. But yes—good things too. You're here. That matters. Stay as long as you like. Compound has space. Compound has time. Almost six years of both."

She moves on before Amara can respond. Simple acceptance. Simple welcome. Simple compound philosophy: Show up. Be present. Let the past be past. Six years is too short for holding grudges.

After dinner, children scatter to play. Adults linger over tea. Zara finds herself in conversation with three other mothers—Adanna, Adaeze, Dr. Tanaka—all with children close to Maya and Kofi's ages. All facing the same mathematics: children who'll die young. Children who'll never finish growing. Children worth loving anyway.

Dr. Tanaka has been Maya and Kofi's pediatrician since their births. Japanese-Nigerian, forty-two now, she specialized in child development back when that specialty had meaning. Now she comes to compound dinners more often, has started attending Wei's garden teachings. Learning presence instead of prescribing it. Zara has watched her transform over the past year—the professional mask thinning, the clinical distance dissolving into something more human. More honest.

Adaeze is another regular at Wei's garden—mother to six-year-old Chioma. Zara remembers when she first arrived at the compound Year 3, terrified, seeking wisdom about parenting toward death. Wei had taught her presence. Now, five years later, she's become part of the teaching circle herself, helping newer parents find their way.

Adanna's son Samuel sits with the other children, nine years old, all confidence and curiosity. Adanna was one of the first to welcome Zara's choice to have Kofi—defended life-choice fiercely when others questioned it. Now she helps anchor the compound's community of parents, showing others that loving children who'll die young is still loving completely.

"Your sister," Adaeze says quietly. "She's the one who detected it?"

"Yes."

"That must have been hard. Knowing before everyone else."

"I think knowing made it worse. She had hours to understand before anyone else. Hours alone with the certainty."

"But she told everyone," Dr. Tanaka adds. "Could have hidden it. Let someone else deliver the news. She didn't."

Zara hasn't thought of it that way. Her sister detecting the asteroid has always felt like betrayal—as if Amara personally chose this future. But Dr. Tanaka is right. Amara could have hidden it. Could have let someone else bear witness. She didn't. She stood up and said: here's what's coming. Here's the truth. Here's the countdown.

That took courage. Zara has spent nine years forgetting that.

"She did," Zara agrees. "She did her job. Then she broke."

"And now she's healing," Adanna observes. "Everyone breaks. The ones who try to heal—those are the brave ones."

Amara is across the room with David and Kwame, looking overwhelmed but present. Maya has returned to show her aunt something on her tablet. Kofi is half-asleep against Amara's side, fighting exhaustion to stay close to this new person who smells like his mother but different, sounds like his mother but softer, feels like family becoming real.

Healing. Yes. Her sister is healing. Slowly. Imperfectly. But really.

That's enough. Has to be. Is enough.

---

Evening settles. Families return to individual apartments. Shared workspace empties. The compound quiets to its nighttime rhythm—soft conversations through walls, children's laughter fading to sleep sounds, the ambient hum of five million people settling in Lagos District.

Zara's apartment fills with family. Maya and Kofi's bedtime routine expands to include Aunt Amara's participation. Kofi insists on one more story—Amara reading haltingly from his butterfly book, clearly unpracticed at reading to children but trying. Maya quizzes her aunt on stellar mechanics before bed, already planning tomorrow's conversation.

Kwame and David do dishes together, still talking, finding that easy companionship of men who understand what showing up means. The kitchen fills with the sounds of domesticity—running water, quiet laughter, plates clinking.

Zara moves through it all feeling something unfamiliar. Not happiness—that's too simple. Not completion—that implies endings. Something else. Something like rightness. Like pieces finding their places. Like fractured family becoming whole not through magic but through choice. Choice to try. Choice to forgive. Choice to show up.

Children finally sleep. Kwame and David retire—David to community housing nearby, Kwame to their bedroom. The apartment settles. Just Zara and Amara remaining, sisters alone for the first time in nine years.

They move to the balcony without discussion. Some conversations need open air. Need darkness. Need the privacy of night.

Lagos District glows below—five million lights defying the countdown. Above: stars beginning to emerge through light pollution. Somewhere up there: the asteroid. Approaching. Inevitable. The certainty that brought them here and pushed them apart and now pulls them back together.

"Why did you wait so long?" Zara asks. Not angry. Just: asking. Genuinely wanting to understand.

Amara is silent for long enough that Zara wonders if she'll answer. Then: "Fear. Shame. Not knowing how."

"How what?"

"How to be human instead of scientist. How to care about things that end. How to love when love means loss." Amara's voice is quiet but steady. "I thought numbness was protection. I thought if I didn't feel anything, I couldn't be hurt. I thought isolation was safer than connection."

"Was it?"

"No. It was dying slowly instead of quickly. Safer maybe, but not living."

They sit with that truth. Zara has spent nine years angry at her sister's choice. But sitting here now, hearing Amara name it honestly, the anger dissolves. Different survival strategies. Both valid. Both understandable. One just happened to look like life while the other looked like death.

"You think I don't feel that?" Zara says finally. "Every day I watch my children grow knowing they'll never finish growing. Maya will be seventeen. Kofi will be thirteen. Never adults. Never their full selves." She looks at her sleeping children's windows. "But I still love them. Still parent them. Still choose presence."

"How?"

"Because the alternative is worse. Loving them completely for thirteen and seventeen years is better than loving them partially for that time. Presence is better than absence. Pain is better than numbness. That's what Wei taught me. That's what the garden teaches everyone."

"Love isn't less real because it ends," Zara continues. "It's more real. Because you know you can't take it for granted. Because every moment is the moment you have. Because temporary makes everything infinite."

Amara is crying now. Quiet tears reflecting Lagos District lights. "I'm sorry I missed so much. Maya's birth. Kofi's birth. More than eight years of their lives. I can't get that back. I know I can't."

"No. You can't." Truth serves better than comfort. "But you have almost six years left. Almost six years to be their aunt. That's not nothing."

"Is it enough?"

Zara considers this—the question she asks herself daily. Is fourteen years enough for Kofi? Is seventeen enough for Maya? Is almost six years enough for her sister to become family again?

"Nothing's ever enough if you think it should be permanent," Zara says, Wei's wisdom flowing through her. "But it's what we have. And being present to what we have—really present—makes it enough. Not satisfying. Not what we'd choose. But enough. Complete. Real."

Amara reaches into her bag—small one she's been carrying since arrival. Pulls out something wrapped in cloth. "I brought something. For Maya."

She unwraps it carefully. A telescope. Small, old, well-used. Brass fittings worn smooth with handling. The kind of instrument that's been loved for decades.

Zara recognizes it immediately. "Grandmother's telescope."

"She gave it to me when I was Maya's age. I want Maya to have it."

Zara takes the telescope, feeling its weight, its history. She remembers Amara with this as a child. Remembers her sister at eleven years old setting it up on their Mumbai balcony, tracking stars with fierce concentration. Remembers thinking: my sister sees things I can't see. My sister reaches for what's distant.

"She'll love it," Zara says. "She's so much like you. Brilliant. Curious. Precise. Sees patterns everywhere."

"But she's also like you. She feels things. Cries at sad stories. Laughs with her brother. She's balanced in ways I never was. In ways you always were."

"She's herself. That's what matters."

"To look at the asteroid?" Amara asks, echoing what must be everyone's assumption about a telescope given now.

"To look at everything," Zara corrects gently. "While she can. To see what's here. To witness fully. To practice presence through observation."

Amara nods. "Yes. That's what I meant. Not fixating on what's coming. Attending to what's here."

They sit together holding the telescope between them—three generations of Okafor women connected through brass and glass and the practice of seeing. Grandmother to Amara to Maya. Knowledge and curiosity and the fierce desire to understand how things work passing through bloodline and gift.

"Thank you," Zara says. "For bringing this. For being here. For trying."

"Thank you for not giving up on me. For keeping the door open. For letting me come back even after nine years of nothing."

"You're my sister. That doesn't change. Even when you disappear. Even when I'm angry. Even when it hurts. You're my sister. That's permanent even when everything else isn't."

Amara reaches for Zara's hand. Sisters holding hands on a balcony in Lagos District while six years tick toward zero and stars emerge overhead and Wei's garden waits for tomorrow's tending. Family choosing family. Presence choosing presence. Love continuing despite everything.

"Six years," Amara whispers.

"Six years," Zara confirms. "We'll make them beautiful."

"I don't know how."

"Neither do I. But we'll learn together. You, me, the children, David, Kwame. All of us learning how to be present. How to love completely. How to face the end with dignity and grace and fierce, defiant life."

"Wei teaches that?"

"The garden teaches that. Wei just tends it. We all just tend it. That's the practice. That's everything."

They sit in comfortable silence—something they couldn't do nine years ago, something they're relearning now. Sisters. Family. Connected despite fracture, loving despite ending, present despite fear.

Inside, the apartment holds sleeping children and waiting beds and tomorrow's beginning. Outside, Lagos District glows with five million persistent lights. Above, stars wheel across the sky carrying their ancient, indifferent light toward a planet that won't survive to see them again.

But right now: sisters together. Family whole. The moment complete in itself.

Tomorrow Amara will meet Wei in the garden at dawn. Will water plants and learn presence. Will begin integrating into compound life. Will practice being aunt and sister and human again. Two weeks stretching toward possible futures—more visits, longer stays, maybe eventually staying.

But that's tomorrow. That's future. That's not here.

Here is: this balcony. This sister. This hand in hand. This breath. This moment.

That's enough.

That's everything.

---

Amara lies in the guest room—small space but welcoming, window overlooking Wei's garden, walls that held Kenji for seven months now holding her for two weeks. Temporary housing. Temporary visit. Everything temporary. Everything valuable.

Through the walls: family sounds. Maya turning pages in bed—reading when she should be sleeping, classic scientist child behavior. Kofi's soft snoring from the adjacent room—completely unconscious, surrendered to sleep with absolute trust. Kwame and Zara's quiet voices, conversation too soft to hear but intimate and warm. David somewhere in community housing nearby, probably also lying awake processing the day.

Family sounds. Life sounds. Real sounds.

So different from her monitoring station dormitory. So different from more than eight years of isolation. So different from numbness and calculation and choosing emptiness over connection.

She thinks about David visiting the arrays that morning—was it really just this morning? It feels like weeks ago. Him showing her his work. His meaning. His practice. Then planning this trip together. Then arriving together. Then being absorbed into Zara's life together.

Thirteen months of dating. Slowly rebuilding. Small steps. Breakfast once a week becoming breakfast twice becoming daily calls becoming this—integrated visit, testing whether their connection extends beyond just them.

So far: yes. David fits here. Kwame likes him. The children accept him. The compound welcomes him. And Amara... Amara fits too. Maybe. Possibly. The children claim her as aunt. Zara forgives her. The community accepts her. Wei approves.

Almost six years until impact. Two weeks here now. More visits planned—Maya and Kofi visiting Antarctica next month. Another extended stay in Year 10. Eventually, maybe... staying? David mentioned leaving the arrays Year 13. Four years from now. Could they be here? Together? With family? Connected?

Too early to know. Too distant to plan. But: possible. Real possibility instead of impossible isolation.

Amara turns to face the window. Wei's garden is visible below—shadows and shapes in the darkness, the lemon tree standing patient, gardenias invisible but present. Tomorrow she'll water them. Learn Wei's practice. Tend life that will end but grows anyway.

More than eight years wasted. But almost six years remaining.

Better late than never.

The thought comes with grief and gratitude intertwined. Grief for what she missed—most of Maya's childhood, Kofi's first eight years, Zara's transformation into this present, powerful woman. Gratitude that she's here now. That her sister forgave. That her niblings accept her. That family chose her despite absence.

Temporary and valuable.

Ending and meaningful.

Brief and complete.

All of it true simultaneously. Wei's teaching. Zara's wisdom. The garden's lesson applied to family, to love, to the almost six years remaining.

From Maya's room: pages turning. From Kofi's room: soft breathing. From Zara and Kwame's room: settled silence. From outside: Lagos District's persistent glow. From above: stars indifferent and beautiful. From within: something Amara hasn't felt in more than eight years.

Peace.

Not happiness—that's too simple. Not healing—that's too complete. Just: peace. Small peace. Fragile peace. Real peace.

The peace of showing up. Of being present. Of choosing connection despite fear. Of family sounds through walls. Of tomorrow's garden waiting. Of almost six years to practice presence instead of more than eight years of practiced absence.

Amara closes her eyes. Sleep comes easier than it has in years. Not the exhausted collapse of isolation. Not the drugged unconsciousness of numbness. The peaceful rest of someone who belongs somewhere. Someone who's part of something. Someone who's home.

Family sounds continue through walls. Lagos District glows beyond windows. The asteroid approaches through darkness. Six years tick forward.

But right now: sleep. Rest. Peace.

Tomorrow: watering. Learning. Presence. Practice.

Tomorrow: beginning again.

Tomorrow: enough.

She sleeps.
