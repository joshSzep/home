# Chapter 43: Transmission

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 14, Month 6 | Lagos District**

---

The equation is wrong.

Zara can see it from the kitchen doorway—Maya's handwriting on the tablet, orbital mechanics, the integration constant off by a factor of three. Her daughter hunched over the work at the rooftop table, sunrise painting everything copper and gold. Amara beside her, patient, letting Maya find the error herself.

Nine months. Nine months since her sister arrived permanently. Nine months of this: morning physics lessons on the rooftop, Amara teaching Maya everything she knows about the mathematics ending them. Not preparing her for a career. Preparing her for nothing except understanding. Except presence. Except the beauty of knowing how the universe works even when the universe is killing you.

Zara watches through the doorway. Doesn't interrupt. This is sacred somehow—her brilliant sister teaching her brilliant daughter, both of them bent over equations that describe the asteroid's perfect trajectory. Love made visible through mathematics. Connection through precision.

"See it?" Amara asks quietly.

Maya stares at the numbers. Her face has that concentration Zara remembers from when she was two, building block towers. Fierce focus. Complete presence. Then: "Oh. The constant. I integrated wrong."

"Yes. Try again."

Maya erases, recalculates. Her handwriting is neater than Amara's ever was. Methodical. Careful. Getting it right because getting it right matters, even when right and wrong both end the same way.

Zara feels the familiar tightness in her chest—the one that comes from loving someone who'll die too young. Maya is sixteen years, six months old. Thirteen months until she dies. Less time than she's been practicing presence. Less time than it takes to really become yourself.

But becoming anyway. Fiercely becoming.

"Better," Amara says, checking the work. "See how the ellipse defines the orbit? Mass, velocity, distance—three variables, infinite precision."

"It's beautiful." Maya's voice carries wonder. "Even though it's describing the thing that kills us."

Amara doesn't hesitate. "Especially because. The asteroid follows perfect mathematics. No malice. No intention. Just physics. There's something honest about that."

Zara hears Wei in those words. Hears her sister speaking the philosophy she learned through letters, through garden visits, through three years of slow thawing. Amara teaching what Wei taught: truth is beautiful even when truth is terrible. Especially then.

The morning heat is building—Lagos District's engineered climate maintaining its relentless tropical warmth. Fourteen years of this. Fourteen years of sunrise on this rooftop, this compound, this life Zara chose when most people fled. Building community when building seemed pointless. Planting gardens eight years before impact. Having Kofi when having children was called cruelty.

Defiance. Wei called it defiance. But also: presence. Being here completely while here lasted.

"Mama!" Kofi's voice from the stairwell, all energy despite the early hour. "Mama, Uncle David says I can help with the pump! Can I? Please?"

Zara turns from the doorway. Her son—thirteen years, eight months old, covered in morning bedhead, wearing the shirt he's had for two years because he refuses to let her throw it out. Unstoppable joy incarnate. Thirteen months until he dies. Thirteen months.

She makes herself stop counting. Presence. Here. Now.

"If Uncle David says so, yes. But listen to his instructions."

"I always listen!" Kofi is already bounding down the stairs. "Uncle David! Mama said yes!"

Zara follows him down. The basement maintenance room waits—Tom's domain usually, but David has spent three months learning the compound's systems. Learning through doing. Teaching through presence. The same way he maintained solar arrays for twelve years before choosing family over purpose.

---

The basement smells like water and old concrete. Tom is there already—fifty years old, quiet, competent, working these systems since Year 0. He nods as David and Kofi enter. Professional respect between two people who understand that maintenance is meditation.

"Circulation pump," David explains to Kofi, gesturing at the machinery. "See this seal? When it degrades, flow drops. We test here—" He points. "—measure here, replace here."

Kofi peers at the pump housing with absolute concentration. Zara remembers that expression from when he was three, watching ants in the garden. Same fierce attention to small things.

"But Mama says the compound only has thirteen months left." Kofi's voice is matter-of-fact. He's known about the asteroid since he was old enough to understand counting. "Why maintain what ends?"

David doesn't answer immediately. Zara sees him considering—this is teaching, not just explanation. Tom has stopped his own work, listening. Everyone in this room understands the question's weight.

"Because people need water today," David says finally. "Tomorrow. Next week. Maintenance isn't about forever. It's about function while function matters."

"But it all ends."

"Yes. But it doesn't all end today. Today, this pump needs this seal. Tomorrow, something else will need attention. Thirteen months of tomorrows. Each one matters."

Tom speaks up, his quiet voice filling the space. "Your uncle understands something I learned slowly. I've maintained these systems fifteen years. Could have stopped Year 1 when we knew. But people needed water. So I maintained. Thirteen months left? I'll maintain thirteen more months."

Kofi absorbs this. Zara watches her son's face—processing, integrating, understanding not just intellectually but in his bones. Purpose isn't permanence. Purpose is presence. Wei's teaching through Wei's garden through Zara's parenting through David's maintenance work. Transmission. Seeds passing forward.

"Can I hold the seal?" Kofi asks.

David hands it to him carefully. "Feel how it's cracked? That's where water intrudes. Conductivity drops. System fails. This small thing—" He indicates the rubber ring in Kofi's palm. "—keeps two hundred people's water flowing."

"Small things matter," Kofi says.

"Small things are everything."

Zara stands on the stairs, watching. Her son learning from the man who loved her sister enough to leave twelve years of purpose behind. The man who maintained arrays that would vaporize anyway. The man who chose family when family was all that remained.

Not just engineering transfer. Philosophy transfer. Practice transfer. The understanding that showing up matters even when showing up can't save anything.

Maya and Amara upstairs doing orbital mechanics. Kofi and David down here doing seal replacement. Different subjects. Same teaching. Presence. Attention. Love made visible through the act of explaining something that won't matter and matters completely.

"Test here," David is saying, showing Kofi the diagnostic port. "See the pressure reading? That tells us—"

Zara leaves them to it. Climbs back upstairs. The apartment is quiet—Kwame at the compound community kitchen preparing breakfast for anyone who shows up, his daily practice. Fifteen years of feeding people. Fifteen years of showing up with synth-protein and vegetables and whatever love looks like at 7 AM.

She checks the time. Afternoon will bring the gathering. Mr. Okonkwo called it three days ago: "Year 14, Month 6. Fourteen years of community. Need to mark it. While we can. Before everything scatters." Seven months until her family migrates to Antarctica. Seven months until this compound becomes memory. Then six more months until memory becomes nothing.

Thirteen months. The number everyone keeps saying. Thirteen months until impact. Short enough to feel urgent. Long enough to forget sometimes. Long enough to keep building, teaching, transmitting. Short enough to make it matter.

---

By evening, sixty people gather on the rooftop.

The garden has grown magnificent in eight years. What started as forty square meters of optimistic planting has sprawled to one hundred twenty—Tom and Zara's engineering, Mr. Okonkwo's farming knowledge, fifteen hands tending daily. Eighty percent of the compound's vegetables grow here. Will grow here for thirteen more months. Then: ash.

But tonight: tomatoes ripening. Peppers heavy on stalks. Mint spreading in containers the way mint does—unstoppable, determined, alive. The lemon tree Mr. Okonkwo grafted onto Wei's gift cutting stands eight feet tall now, fruiting reliably. Everything temporary. Everything thriving.

Zara arrives with her family—Kwame, Maya, Kofi, Amara, David. Six people. The unit that will migrate together, die together, matter together for the time that mattering is possible. They find space near the garden's edge. The sunset is beginning—engineered tropical perfection, oranges and purples that look almost real.

Mr. Okonkwo stands at the center of the gathering. Eighty-two years old. Zara has watched him age eight years—Year 6 to Year 14. Slower movement. Deeper lines. But still here. Still tending. Still refusing to let despair win.

"Year 0, detection," he begins without preamble. His voice carries despite its thinness. "Most people fled Lagos. Smart people. Went to family elsewhere. Went to die in familiar places. We stayed. Some trapped. Some choosing. Some just—" He gestures vaguely. "—not knowing what else to do."

Zara remembers Year 0. The exodus. Five million down to three million in six months. Down to two million by Year 2. Building half-empty. Compound hemorrhaging residents weekly. The ones who stayed were stubborn or faithful or broken or defiant. She was defiant. Pregnant with Kofi when everyone said children were cruelty.

"Started sharing meals Month 6," Mr. Okonkwo continues. "After first suicide wave. Someone said—I don't remember who—'Let's eat together. Dying alone is worse than dying together.' So we ate together. Kept eating together. Year 2, started meeting regularly. Making decisions collectively. Building something."

Adanna stands. She doesn't wait for invitation—never has. Forty years old, fierce, uncompromising. "Year 2, I was angry," she says, voice cutting through the evening sounds. "Angry at everything. Especially angry at people having children. Then Zara had Kofi. Chose life when everyone chose despair."

She looks directly at Zara. Their eyes meet across fifteen feet and eight years of history.

"Her family taught me something I couldn't learn alone," Adanna continues. "Brief doesn't mean meaningless. My son Samuel is twenty now." She puts her hand on his shoulder—tall young man, quiet like his mother is loud. "Never thought I'd see him reach twenty. Thank you, Zara. For showing us how to live."

The words land like gifts. Like forgiveness for something that didn't need forgiving. Zara feels tears threatening, blinks them back. Not sadness. Gratitude. Recognition. The compound saw her choice. Learned from it. Changed because she chose life.

Samuel speaks—rare for him. "Kofi's existence gave me permission to keep existing." His voice is soft but steady. "Sounds strange. But: true. Kid born after detection? That's defiance. That's hope. That's life. Thank you."

Kofi, beside Zara, looks overwhelmed. He's listening to adults say his birth mattered. That his fourteen years changed people. Zara squeezes his hand. Wants him to know: yes. You matter. Your brief life matters. Never doubt it.

Tom stands next. Quiet engineer. Fifteen years maintaining water. Zara's collaborator on countless projects. "Fourteen years maintaining water," he says simply. "Could have stopped. But Zara asked me to teach her engineering. We designed greywater systems together. Her children helped. Teaching them—knowing they wouldn't become engineers—that mattered more than building a career would have mattered. This compound taught me: purpose is people, not projects."

David shifts beside Amara. Zara knows he's hearing his own story—twelve years maintaining arrays, teaching meaning through maintenance, learning that purpose could be presence instead of outcomes. Tom is speaking David's language. The language of small repairs that matter completely.

Ling speaks from the garden's center. Gentle woman, thirty-something, who cared for Wei until death Year 11. "Professor Wei said this community understood impermanence better than philosophers. You built gardens knowing they'd end. You loved children knowing they'd die young. You taught skills that wouldn't be careers. You lived. Fully. That's everything."

Wei's name hangs in the air. Three years dead. Still present. Still teaching through everyone she touched. Zara feels the transmission clearly—Wei taught her, Zara built community around that teaching, community now teaches each other. Person to person. Until no more persons. That's how wisdom spreads. Not through books. Through being.

Mr. Okonkwo reclaims the center. "I'm eighty-two. Thought I'd die Year 5. Still tending rooftops. Still growing food. Thirteen months left." He looks around at the garden, at the gathered faces, at the compound that chose life. "Still tending. Because what else? Despair? No. We chose life. Every day. Fourteen years of choosing life. That's complete."

Complete. The word Wei used. Not finished—complete. Whole in itself. Brief and whole simultaneously.

Zara stands before she realizes she's standing. Didn't plan this. But everyone is looking at her and words are necessary.

"Thank you," she begins. Voice steadier than expected. "For letting my family be part of this. For defending my choice to have Kofi. For teaching my children. For being community when I needed community."

She looks at Maya and Kofi. Her daughter watching with that serious expression. Her son still holding her hand.

"We're leaving in seven months. Year 15, Month 1. Going to Antarctica with my sister—" She gestures to Amara. "—for the final convergence. My son Kenji teaches there. We'll be with family for the end."

Saying it aloud makes it real. Seven months of goodbyes beginning. Not urgent panic. Gentle separation. Honoring what was built before letting it dissolve.

"But these fourteen years," Zara continues, "you made them possible. You made them real. When I had Kofi and strangers called it cruelty, you defended it. When I needed community, you built it. When my children needed teaching—" She looks at Tom, at Mr. Okonkwo, at Adanna. "—you taught them. Not what they'd use. What they'd be. How to live despite endings. Thank you."

The silence after is full. Not empty—full. Everyone holding the same understanding. Thirteen months left. Seven until Zara's family leaves. But these fourteen years happened. Were real. Made meaning that death can't undo because meaning exists in presence, not in lasting.

---

Amara and David stand slightly apart. Three months here. New to this community that's fifteen years deep. But Zara sees her sister's face—watching, witnessing, understanding what she missed while isolating.

After the gathering ends—no formal closure, just gradual dispersing—Amara finds Zara by the lemon tree.

"I wasted seven years," Amara says quietly. David is beside her, steady presence. "You built this."

Zara wants to argue. Wants to say: you were surviving differently, we all did what we could, there's no wrong way to face extinction. But she hears Wei's voice: *Let people have their truth. Don't fix it. Witness it.*

"You're here now," Zara says instead. "That's what matters."

"Is it enough? Three months? Nine months total before it ends?"

"Wei would say presence isn't measured in duration. You're here. Present. Teaching Maya. Learning from Kofi. Being family. That's enough."

David speaks. "We lose them either way. Here or not here, connected or isolated. I chose fourteen years on arrays over eight years with you." His voice carries old regret. "That was real. Can't undo it. But these nine months—we're choosing differently. That matters."

Amara nods. She's crying quietly. Not desperate crying. Relief crying. Grief crying. The kind of crying that comes when you finally stop running.

Zara hugs her sister. They stand together under the lemon tree—Wei's tree, Mr. Okonkwo's grafting, Zara's daily watering—while the compound settles into evening. Maya and Kofi are examining tomatoes with fierce attention. Kwame is talking with Tom about tomorrow's breakfast planning. Sixty people dispersing to fifty apartments to sleep and wake and tend and build for one more day.

---

Walking home. Zara with Kwame, Maya, Kofi, Amara, David. Six people in the hallway. Family. The word feels insufficient and perfect simultaneously.

"Mama," Maya asks, "why did Aunt Amara teach me orbital mechanics today? I'll never use it."

Standard Maya question. Everything filtered through practicality and meaning. Zara has answered versions of this for years. But tonight, the answer comes differently.

"She taught you because teaching is loving. Because understanding is presence. Because knowledge passes person to person until there are no persons. But while there are persons—we teach. We learn. We connect."

Kofi adds, "Like Uncle David teaching me maintenance? Even though the compound ends in thirteen months?"

"Exactly."

Amara speaks from behind them. "And like Wei teaching your mother. And your mother teaching you. And Kenji teaching presence. And this compound teaching all of us how to live despite endings. Transmission. That's what we do. That's what makes us human."

Maya stops walking. Turns to look at all of them—Mama, Papa, Kofi, Aunt Amara, Uncle David. Her family. Her teachers. The people who will die with her in ten months.

"I get it," she says quietly. "The teaching matters because it's happening. Not because it lasts. Because it's real right now."

"Yes," Zara says. Feels tears again. Her daughter understands. Nearly seventeen years old and she understands what took Zara forty years to learn. "Yes, baby. That's everything."

They continue walking. The hallway is dimly lit—power conservation, Year 10 policy. But enough light to see each other. Enough light to be present.

At their door, Kofi asks one more question. "Will Antarctica people be like compound people?"

Zara considers. Antarctica at peak held four billion. Now maybe two billion. Megacity beyond comprehension. Will strangers there understand what this compound understands? That brief life is complete life? That presence matters? That choosing life is defiance and wisdom simultaneously?

"Some will," she says. "Uncle Kenji teaches there. Others teaching too. Same practice. Different place. We'll find community. Different community. But real."

"Good." Kofi yawns hugely. "I'm tired. Can I sleep?"

"Yes, baby."

Inside, the apartment is exactly as it's been for fourteen years. Seventy square meters. Plants everywhere—Kwame's obsession. Engineering models on tables—Zara's inability to leave work at work. Children's drawings on walls—years of Maya's artistic phases. Photographs covering every surface—fourteen years of moments captured, preserved, witnessed.

Amara and David have the small bedroom. Three months of cohabitation teaching them how to be together again after eight years apart. Maya and Kofi in their rooms. Kwame heading to shower. Normal domestic evening.

Zara steps onto the balcony.

The compound spreads below. Fifty units. Two hundred people. Fourteen years of choosing life. Rooftop garden visible from here—lemon tree's silhouette, garden beds dark rectangles, mint spreading in containers that no one bothers controlling anymore. Let it spread. Thirteen months until nothing spreads anywhere.

Lagos District beyond. Five million Year 0. Maybe two million now. Half-empty buildings. Infrastructure maintained by people like Tom, like David was, like everyone who shows up daily to fix what breaks because fixing matters even when function ends.

Thirteen months. Seven until migration. Two hundred and thirteen days until Antarctica. Three hundred and ninety-five days until impact. Zara's engineering mind calculates automatically. Can't help it. Numbers make things concrete. Numbers make things bearable. Numbers make things terrible.

Both. Always both. Beautiful and terrible. Present and ending. Connected and temporary.

Tomorrow: more transmission. Amara teaching Maya in the morning. David teaching Kofi in the afternoon. Compound life continuing its rhythms. Tom maintaining water. Mr. Okonkwo tending gardens. Adanna being fierce. Samuel being quiet. Ling caring for what remains.

Teaching continuing until teaching can't continue. Transmission until no one left to transmit to. But tonight: this. Rooftop gathering. Fourteen years honored. Seven months until goodbye. Thirteen months until nothing.

Zara feels Kwame behind her. Doesn't turn. Knows his presence.

"You okay?" he asks.

"Yes. No. Both."

"Good gathering tonight."

"Yes." She leans back against him. Fourteen years married. Nineteen years together. Choosing each other every day for nineteen years. Choosing to bring Maya into the world Year -2. Choosing to bring Kofi Year 0. Choosing life repeatedly, consciously, despite knowing exactly when choosing ends.

"Seven months," Kwame says quietly.

"Seven months."

"Think we'll regret leaving?"

Zara considers. The compound has been home since Year 0. But family is in Antarctica—Kenji, Elena, others. And Kenji's teaching. And the final convergence. And being together at the end.

"No," she decides. "We'll miss this. But we won't regret choosing family."

"Good."

They stand on the balcony while night deepens. The compound quiets. Two hundred people sleeping, dreaming, being alive in the ways that being alive happens. Tomorrow they'll wake. Tend gardens. Maintain water. Teach children. Share meals. Practice presence. All of it temporary. All of it real.

Inside, Maya is reading by lamplight—physics textbook Amara brought from Antarctica. Kofi is already asleep—exhausted from the day's excitement. Both children growing. Both children dying. Both children here now, complete for their ages, mattering because they're real not because they'll last.

Zara taught them that. Wei taught Zara. The compound taught everyone. Transmission. Knowledge spreading like mint in containers—unstoppable, determined, alive until it can't be alive anymore.

The flower still blooming. Still passing seeds forward. Until there's no soil left to plant in.

That's enough.

That's everything.

---

Night. Zara lies in bed, not sleeping. Kwame beside her breathing steadily. Through the wall, Maya's lamp still glowing—her daughter reading, always reading, absorbing everything she can before absorption ends. Kofi silent—deep sleeper, always has been. Amara and David in the small bedroom, their reconciliation continuing in whispers and touch and the daily choice to stay present.

Family. Gathered. Here.

Fourteen years ago, Zara was pregnant with Kofi. Everyone called it cruelty. Everyone said: how could you bring a child into this? How could you give them fourteen years then nothing?

Tonight, adults thanked her. Said Kofi's existence gave them permission to live. Said brief doesn't mean meaningless. Said fourteen years was complete.

They were right. She was right. Wei was right. Everyone who chose life over despair was right.

Kofi will die at fourteen years, nine months. Maya at seventeen years, seven months. Kwame at fifty-three. Amara at sixty-three. David at sixty-four. Zara at forty-nine. Everyone in this building, this district, this planet. All temporary. All real. All mattering precisely because they're here now, fully here, present to their own brief blooming.

Teaching continues tomorrow. David showing Kofi how seals work. Amara showing Maya how orbits work. Tom showing anyone who asks how water works. Mr. Okonkwo showing everyone how gardens work. The compound showing the world how community works.

Transmission. Person to person. Moment to moment. Day by day. Until there are no more days.

But today happened. Tonight happened. Fourteen years happened. The gathering happened. The honoring happened. The gratitude happened. The teaching happened. The transmission happened.

Real. Complete. Enough.

Zara closes her eyes. Tomorrow will come. Then the next day. Then seven months of tomorrows until migration. Then six months of tomorrows until nothing. Each one temporary. Each one whole.

She sleeps.

Dreams of gardens blooming. Of Maya teaching others. Of Kofi repairing pumps. Of Kwame feeding multitudes. Of Amara calculating beauty. Of David maintaining meaning. Of two hundred people choosing life.

Dreams of transmission continuing. Seeds spreading. Knowledge passing. Love made visible.

Dreams of home.

This compound. This family. This practice. This presence. This moment. This breath.

Home was always here. Never left. Never gone.

Just: here.

Complete.

Enough.

Everything.
