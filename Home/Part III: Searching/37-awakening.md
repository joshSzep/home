# Chapter 37: Awakening

**Maya Okafor-Mensah | Year 11, Month 9 | Lagos District**

---

The garden was wrong.

Maya sat on the bench—Wei's bench—and felt the wrongness in her chest. Everything looked right. The lemon tree Wei planted fifty-two years ago. The gardenias blooming white and fragrant. The herbs spreading in their containers. Ling had maintained everything perfectly. The mint, the basil, the small tomato plants. All here. All growing. All continuing.

But Wei wasn't.

One week. Seven days since Wei died. Since her body stopped breathing and her consciousness ended and everyone cried and the funeral happened and the ashes went into the soil. One week since Maya watched someone die for the first time.

She was thirteen years, eleven months old. Nearly fourteen. Old enough to understand death intellectually—she'd understood it since she was three. Everything ends. Nothing lasts. Impermanence is truth. Wei had been teaching her this literally her entire remembered life.

But understanding wasn't the same as witnessing.

Maya's hands were shaking. She noticed this distantly, like observing data. Grief was physical. Her chest hurt. Her throat hurt. Her eyes hurt from crying. She'd cried for seven days. Thought she'd be empty by now. But the tears kept coming.

The butterfly book sat in her lap. *The Butterfly Life Cycle*. Wei had given it to her when she was four. Maya had read it hundreds of times. Could recite it. "The caterpillar doesn't become a butterfly—it transforms into what it always was going to be." Wei's correction, years ago. Making language precise. Making truth visible.

Maya opened to the page showing the butterfly emerging. Wings wet, body vulnerable, transformation complete. Three days of flying, then death. Brief life. Complete life. Wei used to say that. "The butterfly blooms for three days. But those three days are whole. Complete in themselves. Not incomplete because brief."

Maya closed the book. Pressed it against her chest. Wei's voice was still so clear in her memory. But Wei was gone. The voice would fade. The teachings would blur. Memory was impermanent too. Everything was impermanent. She'd known this. But knowing and experiencing were different.

She remembered Wei telling her a story. Years ago. Maya must have been seven or eight. They'd been in this garden, sitting on this bench. Wei had been talking about the Buddha. Not religious Buddhism—Wei didn't teach religion. Philosophical Buddhism. The observation of suffering and impermanence and consciousness.

"The Buddha was a prince," Wei had said. "Siddhartha Gautama. His father kept him in the palace. Protected from everything difficult. Beautiful gardens. Perfect life. Never saw sickness, old age, or death. Sheltered completely."

Maya had been watering the gardenias. She remembered the watering can, the way water darkened the soil. "Why?"

"Because his father wanted him happy. Thought if Siddhartha never saw suffering, he'd never suffer. But you can't be awake while sheltered from truth."

"What happened?"

"He left the palace. Saw four sights. First: a sick person. Second: an old person. Third: a dead body. Fourth: a wandering ascetic—someone who'd given up everything to seek truth. Those four sights changed everything."

"Why?"

"Because he saw what his father had been hiding. Everyone gets sick. Everyone gets old. Everyone dies. The truth everyone pretends isn't real. Seeing it—really seeing it, not just knowing about it—that awakened him. That started his journey. He couldn't go back to pretending once he'd seen."

Maya hadn't understood then. Not really. She'd understood the words. Understood that death was real. But she hadn't *felt* it. Hadn't witnessed it. Hadn't had the truth made visceral.

Now she had.

Wei's empty wheelchair sat in the corner of the balcony. Ling had cleaned it, folded it, stored it neatly. But it was still there. Physical evidence of absence. Wei wasn't coming back. Would never wheel herself out here at dawn. Would never water the lemon tree with shaking hands. Would never teach through flowers and silence and the simple act of being present.

The Buddha saw death and awakened. Maya watched death and something broke open in her chest. Not broke in the sense of damage. Broke in the sense of: cracking, opening, letting truth in.

Death wasn't abstract anymore.

It was Wei's body cooling. Wei's breath stopping. Wei's last words—"The flower bloomed"—hanging in the air and then silence. Complete silence. The kind of silence that meant someone was gone forever.

Maya stood. Walked to the lemon tree. The soil was still darker where Wei's ashes had been poured. One week ago. Carbon and calcium and phosphorus. Fifty-two years of life reduced to dust. Now feeding the tree she'd tended. The cycle continuing. Everything composting into everything else.

She touched the trunk. Rough bark. Solid wood. The tree didn't know Wei died. Didn't grieve. Just grew. Absorbed nutrients. Bloomed. Fruited. Did what trees do. Life continuing because life doesn't stop for individual death.

That was the truth beneath the philosophy. That was what the Buddha saw. That was what Wei's death revealed: the world doesn't stop. The garden keeps blooming. The sun keeps rising. Everyone Maya loved would die and the universe wouldn't notice.

Her mother would die at forty-nine years old. Her father at fifty-three. Kofi at fourteen. Everyone in this compound. Everyone in Lagos. Everyone everywhere. The asteroid would come and consciousness would end and the universe would continue exactly as it had before consciousness existed.

Three years, eight months. Forty-four months. Maya had calculated it precisely the morning after Wei died. She would die at seventeen years, seven months old. Not eighteen. Not twenty. Never twenty-one. Never an adult. Never independent. Never anything beyond: daughter, sister, student. Brief life. Abbreviated life. Incomplete life.

No. Not incomplete. Wei's voice in memory: "Brief doesn't mean incomplete. A butterfly lives three days. Is that incomplete? Or is that: a complete butterfly life? Duration doesn't measure value. Presence does."

Maya sat on the ground. Dirt under her palms. Solid earth. Real earth. Temporary earth. In forty-four months this garden would vaporize. The lemon tree would burn. The ashes that were Wei would transform again—this time into plasma, into energy, into nothing human consciousness could witness.

And Maya would be dead. She would be seventeen years, seven months old and then she would be nothing. No afterlife. No reincarnation. Wei didn't teach those comforts. Just: consciousness ends. The self dissolves. Being stops. Not tragic—natural. Not wrong—inevitable. Just: true.

She'd understood this since she was small. But understanding was easy. Accepting was different. Being present to the truth without flinching—that was practice.

Maya pulled her knees to her chest. Let herself cry again. Tears coming hot and fast. Grief for Wei. Grief for herself. Grief for Kofi. Grief for everyone she loved who would die too young. The crying hurt. Physically hurt. But she didn't stop it.

Wei had taught her this too. "Grief is appropriate response to loss. Don't bypass it. Don't avoid it. Feel it. Let it move through you. Presence includes pain. Includes fear. Includes everything."

The crying gradually quieted. Maya's breath slowed. She wiped her face on her sleeve. The garden was still there. The lemon tree. The gardenias. The mint spreading in containers. All blooming. All temporary. All here.

A question surfaced. The question Mama had asked Wei's final night: "Will we be ready?"

Would Maya be ready to die at seventeen? Ready to face the asteroid? Ready to watch everyone she loved die alongside her? Ready for consciousness to end?

No. The answer was clear. She would not be ready. Readiness implied preparation, completion, acceptance. She would be seventeen. Still young. Still becoming. How could she be ready for that to end?

But Wei had taught something else. Not ready—*present*. Different word. Different meaning. Ready meant prepared. Present meant here. Maya couldn't prepare for death. Couldn't make seventeen years enough. Couldn't make the ending okay.

But she could be present. Could practice being here, fully here, until here ended. Could witness her own brief life completely. Could love what she'd lose. Could die awake instead of asleep.

That was what Wei showed her. Dying at 125 years old, fully conscious, present to the end. No fear. No resistance. Just: "The flower bloomed." Acknowledgment. Recognition. Completion not because the lifespan was sufficient, but because the presence was complete.

Maya could do that. Not perfectly. Not easily. But: possibly. If she practiced. If she learned everything Wei would have taught her. If she spent her remaining forty-four months awake instead of hiding from truth.

She stood. Brushed dirt from her clothes. The decision was crystallizing. Not a thought—a knowing. Deeper than intellect. This was her path. This was what she would do with her brief life. Not pretend death wasn't coming. Not numb herself to the horror. Not hide in distractions or denial or despair.

She would practice. Would learn presence. Would die at seventeen years, seven months old, but would die awake. Would make her abbreviated life matter not through duration but through depth. Through witness. Through being here completely until here ended.

The vow formed itself: *I will learn everything. I will practice presence. I will die awake.*

Not because it would save her. Not because it would make death okay. Because Wei showed her it was possible. Because presence was the only thing she could control. Because forty-four months of being fully alive was better than seventeen years of hiding from death.

Maya walked through the garden. Noticed everything. The way light moved through leaves. The smell of mint and tomato plants. The rough texture of the lemon tree trunk. The gardenias opening, white petals unfurling. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything here now.

This was practice. This was what Wei taught. Not big dramatic revelations. Just: noticing. Being present to what was here. Not because it lasted. Because it was happening.

Footsteps on the stairs. Maya turned. Kofi appeared in the doorway. Ten years, eleven months old. Nearly eleven. Her little brother who would die at fourteen.

"Mama's worried," Kofi said. "You've been here four hours."

Four hours? Maya hadn't noticed time passing. She'd been... where had she been? Present. Grieving. Awakening. Something.

Kofi came closer. Looked at her face. "You've been crying."

"Yes."

"About Grandmother Wei?"

"Yes." Maya looked at her brother. Really looked at him. He would die in thirty-eight months. Younger than her. Less time to understand. Less time to practice. The injustice of it rose in her throat—he'd barely be a teenager. Would never finish growing. Would never—

She stopped the thought. Presence. Here. Now. Kofi was here. Alive. Ten years, eleven months old and fully himself. That was what mattered.

"Kofi, I need to tell you something about death."

He sat on the bench. Serious suddenly. "I know. Wei died."

"Yes. And we will too."

"I know that too. The asteroid."

"Yes." Maya sat beside him. "But Wei taught me something. Showed me something. I want to tell you."

Kofi waited. Patient. Present in the way children naturally were. Not anxious about what was coming. Just: here. Listening.

"You're going to die when you're fourteen years old," Maya said. The words came out steady. Clear. Not cruel—honest. "That's not enough time. It's not fair. It's not what you deserve. But it's true. You'll die young."

Kofi nodded slowly. "I know."

"But—" Maya took his hand. Small hand. Warm hand. Real hand. "Wei showed me something. She lived 125 years. I'll live seventeen. You'll live fourteen. Those are different amounts. But they're not different in the way I thought. Long life isn't better than short life if the long life is asleep. If someone lives 125 years but never pays attention, never really *sees* their life—that's not better than fourteen years awake."

Kofi was quiet. Thinking. His face had that concentrated expression he got when trying to understand something hard.

"I'm not saying it's okay that you'll die young," Maya continued. "It's not okay. It's horrible. I'm so angry about it I can barely breathe sometimes. But Wei showed me—you can't change how long you live. You can only change how present you are while living. And being present, really present, makes the time *matter* even if it's brief."

"Like butterflies?" Kofi asked.

"Yes. Exactly like butterflies. Three days of flying but fully alive. That's better than thirty years of existing but never really being here."

"How do you be present?"

Maya felt tears coming again. But different tears. Not grief—something else. Gratitude, maybe. That Kofi asked. That he wanted to learn. That she could teach him.

"You practice," she said. "You notice things. Like right now—you're sitting on this bench. Can you feel the wood under you? Can you hear the sounds from the district below? Can you smell the gardenias?"

Kofi closed his eyes. Concentrated. "Yes. I feel the bench. I hear people talking. I smell... flowers. And something else. Mint?"

"Yes. Mint. That's presence. That's being here. Not thinking about yesterday or tomorrow. Just: noticing this moment. This bench. These smells. This feeling. That's all practice is."

"That's all?"

Maya laughed—surprised by the sound. First laugh in a week. "That's everything. It sounds simple. It's impossibly hard. Your mind will wander constantly. You'll forget. You'll get distracted. You'll spend whole days asleep to your own life. But when you notice you've wandered—you just come back. Notice again. Be here again. That's the practice. Coming back. Again and again."

Kofi opened his eyes. Looked at the garden. Then at Maya. "Will you teach me?"

The question landed like a gift. Like grace. Like transmission happening naturally, inevitably, necessarily. Maya teaching Kofi. Kofi learning presence. The cycle continuing. Wei taught Mama. Mama taught Maya. Maya teaching Kofi. Knowledge passing forward until there was no forward left. But still: passing. Still: mattering.

"Yes," Maya said. "I'll teach you everything I learn. Everything Wei taught me. Everything Uncle Kenji can teach us. We'll practice together. For thirty-eight months. Until it ends. But those thirty-eight months—we'll be awake for them. Really awake. Okay?"

"Okay." Kofi smiled slightly. "Can we practice now?"

"We are practicing. Right now. Sitting here. Talking. Being together. That's presence. That's everything."

They sat quietly. Brother and sister. Fourteen and seventeen when they died. Not enough time. Never enough time. But right now: here. On this bench. In this garden. Wei's ashes feeding the lemon tree. The gardenias blooming. Everything temporary. Everything whole.

After a while, Kofi leaned against her. Maya put her arm around him. Felt his weight. His warmth. His aliveness. In thirty-eight months he would be dead and she would die seven months later and this moment would have never existed as far as the universe was concerned.

But it existed now. She witnessed it now. That mattered. That was everything. That was what Wei meant.

The flower bloomed.

Evening brought the family home.

Maya and Kofi returned to the apartment together. Mama looked up from her engineering schematics, face tight with worry that relaxed when she saw them. Papa emerged from the kitchen, dinner smells following.

"You were at the garden a long time," Mama said carefully.

"Yes." Maya set down the butterfly book. Looked at her parents. Saw them differently now. Not just Mama and Papa. Two people who would die. Who would watch their children die. Who chose presence anyway. Who kept parenting, kept working, kept loving despite knowing exactly when it would end.

"Mama. Papa. I need to tell you something."

They sat. The apartment suddenly very small. Very intimate. Four people who would die together. Family lasting exactly as long as everyone in it lasted. Then: gone. But right now: here.

"Wei's death changed something in me," Maya said. "I understood impermanence before. Intellectually. But watching her die—really witnessing it—that's different. That's..." She searched for words. "That's like the Buddha. Leaving the palace. Seeing death for the first time. Everything I understood became everything I *knew*. Does that make sense?"

Mama's eyes were glistening. "Yes."

"I'm going to die at seventeen years, seven months old. I calculated it exactly. Forty-four months from now. That's not enough time. I'll never be an adult. Never be independent. Never have all the experiences I'm supposed to have. It's not fair. It's horrible. I'm so angry about it."

Papa started to speak. Maya held up her hand.

"But I can't change it. None of us can. So I have a choice. I can spend forty-four months hiding from that truth. Distracting myself. Pretending it's not coming. Or I can spend forty-four months present. Really present. Awake to my own brief life. Learning everything I can. Practicing what Wei taught. Dying at seventeen but dying conscious. Aware. Here."

Silence. Her parents looking at her. Seeing her. Maybe seeing that she wasn't quite a child anymore. Wasn't quite an adult. But was: herself. Complete for her age. Here for however long here lasted.

"I want to study with Uncle Kenji," Maya said. "Formally. Everything he learned from Wei. Everything she would have taught me if she'd lived. I don't want to waste the time I have left."

Mama was crying. Not sad crying. Something else. Pride, maybe. Or recognition. Or grief for all the versions of Maya that would never exist alongside pride for the version that did.

"Of course," Mama said. "Of course you can study with Kenji."

"You're so young," Papa said quietly. "Thirteen. This is heavy for thirteen."

"I'm almost fourteen. And I don't have time to wait until I'm older. Wei died when I was thirteen. That was my awakening. I can't go back to being a child who doesn't know. I've seen. I've witnessed. I can't unsee it."

Kofi spoke up from the corner. "Maya's teaching me too. Presence. Being here. She explained it in the garden."

Mama and Papa looked at him. Then at Maya. Then at each other. Some wordless communication passing between them. Finally Mama nodded.

"Okay. Yes. I'll talk to Kenji. You can study with him. Both of you, if Kofi wants. We'll make it work."

"Thank you." Maya felt exhaustion suddenly. Four hours in the garden. This conversation. The weight of the decision. The clarity of the path. All of it pressing down. "I'm tired. Can I sleep?"

"Of course, baby." Mama pulled her into a hug. Held tight. Too tight. Like she was trying to hold Maya here, in this moment, in this body, in this life. Like love could prevent death if only you held hard enough.

It couldn't. Maya knew that. But the holding mattered anyway. Presence to presence. Love despite loss. That was everything. That was what forty-four months of practice would teach her to do even better.

She pulled back. Looked at her mother's face. Forty-four years old. Five more years. Forty-nine at impact. Young by historical standards. Old enough by any measure. Beautiful. Temporary. Here.

"I love you, Mama."

"I love you, Maya. So much. So, so much."

"I know."

Maya went to her room. Lay on her bed. Stared at the ceiling. The apartment sounds continued around her—Papa making dinner, Mama talking quietly with Kofi, the building settling, the district humming outside. Normal sounds. Temporary sounds. Real sounds.

She'd awakened. That was the only word for it. The Buddha's word. Siddhartha seeing death and understanding: this is the truth. This is what everyone faces. This is what shapes everything.

Maya was thirteen years, eleven months old and she'd awakened to mortality. Not everyone's mortality abstractly. Her own mortality specifically. Seventeen years, seven months, then nothing. That was her lifespan. Brief. Insufficient. Real.

And she would spend it awake. Would practice presence. Would learn everything she could. Would teach Kofi. Would die conscious. Would make her abbreviated life matter not through what she accomplished but through how completely she witnessed it.

The flower would bloom. For forty-four months. Then fall. But the blooming—that was real. That was whole. That was complete.

Wei showed her. The Buddha showed her. Death showed her.

Now Maya would show others. Would teach. Would practice. Would be present. Until presence ended.

That was enough. That was everything. That was all anyone could ever do.

She closed her eyes. Felt the bed under her. The pillow. Her breath moving. Her heart beating. Forty-four months of heartbeats. Forty-four months of breaths. Forty-four months of moments. Each one complete. Each one enough. Each one everything.

Maya slept. And dreamed of gardens. And butterflies. And Wei's voice saying: "The flower bloomed."

Yes. The flower bloomed. Was blooming. Would bloom until it couldn't. That was the practice. That was the teaching. That was life itself.

Brief. Beautiful. Whole.

---

Morning arrived too early.

Maya woke with the light. Six AM. The apartment quiet. Everyone still sleeping except her. She lay in bed feeling... different. Lighter somehow. The grief was still there—would always be there, probably. But something had shifted. Yesterday's awakening had settled overnight. Clarified. Become: truth she carried instead of truth that carried her.

She got up. Dressed quietly. Walked barefoot to the balcony door. Slipped outside.

The sun was rising over Lagos District. Two hundred million people waking to Year 11, Month 9. Four years left. Everyone facing the same ending. Most not thinking about it. Some thinking about it constantly. A few—like her—practicing presence to it. Being awake to it.

Maya stood in the morning light and made one more vow. Silent. Private. Hers alone.

*I will practice. I will be present. I will teach what I learn. I will love what I'll lose. I will witness my brief life completely. I will die at seventeen years, seven months old. But I will die awake.*

*The flower will bloom.*

The sun climbed. The city woke. Maya stood present to it all. Beginning.
