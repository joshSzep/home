# Chapter 25: Threshold

**Dr. Amara Okafor & David Chen | Year 8, Month 2 | Antarctica**

---

Amara stood outside David's apartment door, hand raised to knock, frozen.

Four years. Four years since the divorce. Six months since she'd called Zara from that empty monitoring station. Six months since she'd started trying to thaw. And now this: reaching out to the person she'd hurt most. The person who'd tried longest. The person she'd pushed away until he'd finally stopped trying.

Building seventeen, apartment 4C. She'd lived here once. Year 0 through Year 4, Month 4. Then she'd moved to the station permanently, and David had filed papers two weeks later. Clean break. Necessary break. She'd signed without reading.

Her hand was still raised. Still not knocking.

What was she doing here?

The answer came from Zara's voice in her head, six months of phone calls and slowly rebuilding: *"You can't heal everything at once, Amara. But you can try. One person at a time. Starting with the people you pushed away."*

Amara had visited Lagos twice since that first call. Met Kofi properly—seven years old now, joyful and curious, calling her "Aunt Amara" like they'd known each other forever. Reconnected with Maya—ten and brilliant and asking questions about astrophysics that reminded Amara painfully of herself. Met Professor Wei, body failing but mind sharp, still teaching from her garden. Begun learning what presence meant.

But she hadn't contacted David. Hadn't known how. He'd tried so many times—Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, even that last attempt Year 4. She'd felt nothing. Said nothing that mattered. He'd finally stopped. Filed for divorce. Given up.

Why would he want to hear from her now?

*Because maybe he's as lonely as you were,* Zara had said last week. *Because maybe four years is long enough. Because you won't know unless you try.*

So here she was. Trying. Terrified.

She knocked.

Footsteps inside. The door opened.

David stood there—fifty-six years old, thinner than she remembered, grey threading through his hair. He wore his off-duty clothes: comfortable pants, old sweater. His expression cycled through surprise, confusion, uncertainty.

"Amara."

"Hi." Her voice came out smaller than intended. "Can I come in?"

He hesitated. She saw him processing: four years of silence, sudden appearance, what did this mean? Then he stepped aside. "Of course."

The apartment looked the same. Same furniture. Same kitchen layout. But emptier somehow. Cleaner. Less lived-in. David's space now, not theirs. She felt like an intruder.

"Tea?" he offered.

"Please."

They moved to the kitchen. The ritual was familiar—David filling the kettle, pulling down cups, the motions they'd done together thousands of times. But different now. Careful. Distant. The ease gone.

Amara sat at the small table. This table. Where they'd eaten meals, reviewed work, existed in comfortable parallel before everything broke. Now it felt kilometers wide.

David brought tea. Sat across from her. Waited.

"I'm sorry for showing up without calling," Amara started. "I should have called. I just—I didn't know what to say. Still don't, honestly."

"It's okay." His voice was measured. Not cold, but guarded. "You're here now. What did you want to talk about?"

What did she want? Amara wrapped her hands around the warm cup, gathering courage.

"I called Zara. Six months ago. Year 7, Month 9. First real conversation in years." The words came slowly, carefully. "It made me realize: I've been hiding from everyone. Including you."

David nodded slightly. Processing. Not interrupting.

"When you left—when you filed for divorce—I thought you were giving up. Walking away. I was angry about it, in the distant way I was angry about everything. Felt it barely, but felt it."

"I wasn't walking away," David said quietly. "You had already left. I just made it official."

The words stung. But they were true. Amara took a breath.

"I know. You're right. I disappeared into data Year 0. You tried to reach me—so many times. I couldn't let you. Couldn't let anyone. The numbness was complete. I thought it was protection." She met his eyes. "It was just slow death."

David looked at his tea. "I disappeared too. Into maintenance. Into routine. We both chose work over each other."

"You tried to choose differently. I wouldn't let you."

"For a while. Then I gave up. That's on me too."

They sat in the silence of shared failure. Two people who'd loved each other once, broken by extinction's weight, divorced badly, spending four years separate and numb.

Amara found herself speaking again. "I've been visiting Zara. In Lagos. Met Kofi properly. He's wonderful. Joyful. Seven years old and fully alive despite everything."

"How is Zara?"

"Good. Tired. Scared about having seven years left. But present. Really present. She built something real—family, community, life that matters despite ending."

David absorbed this. "And Maya?"

"Ten years old. Brilliant. Asks about orbital mechanics and asteroid composition. She's like me but better—feels things, cries at stories, laughs with her brother. Balanced."

"You don't sound numb talking about them."

Amara realized he was right. Talking about her niece and nephew, about Zara's garden and Lagos life—her voice had warmth. Not much, but real. Measurable.

"The numbness is cracking," she admitted. "Slowly. Six months of trying. Of calling Zara weekly. Of letting myself care about Maya and Kofi even though caring means feeling the seven years they have left. It hurts. But it's better than nothing."

David was watching her now. Really watching. Seeing her, maybe, for the first time in years.

"Why are you here, Amara?"

The direct question. She'd been circling it. Time to be honest.

"Because I miss you." Simple truth. "I missed you even when I couldn't feel it. I missed you through all seven years of numbness. And now that I'm starting to feel again, I realize: I don't want to spend the next seven years wondering if we threw away something salvageable."

David's expression was complicated. Hope mixed with caution mixed with old pain.

"Did we?" he asked. "Throw away something salvageable?"

"I don't know. But we have seven years left. I don't want to spend them alone anymore. And I think—I hope—you don't want to either."

"I don't," David said after a long moment. "I've been alone four years. It's—" He paused, searching for words. "—it's sustainable. I have work. I have 47B. I have purpose. But it's not enough. It's almost enough, but not quite."

Amara understood. She'd lived in "almost enough" for years. It was survivable but not livable.

"I can't promise I'm fixed," she said carefully. "Can't promise I won't retreat into data again. Can't promise I know how to be a good partner. I'm still learning how to be human after seven years of calculating."

"I can't promise I'm different either. I still hide in maintenance. Still choose work over vulnerability. Still spend twelve hours a day on the arrays maintaining systems that will vaporize anyway."

They looked at each other across the table. Two broken people. Two failures at connection. Two people who'd hurt each other through absence and avoidance and choosing safe numbness over risky presence.

"So where does that leave us?" Amara asked.

David considered. When he spoke, his voice was tentative. "Maybe we start over. Not as people who failed at marriage. As two people who used to love each other, divorced badly, and want to try again."

"Try what exactly? Remarriage?"

"No." David shook his head. "That's too much. Too fast. Too scary. Just—trying. Dating, maybe. Getting to know each other again. Seeing if connection is still possible after everything."

Dating. The word felt absurd. They'd been married sixteen years. But maybe David was right. Maybe they needed to start from the beginning. Rebuild foundation that had crumbled.

"Small steps?" Amara suggested.

"Small steps," David confirmed. "Breakfast together once a week. Talking daily. Being honest about what we're feeling, or not feeling. No pressure to fix everything. Just—showing up."

Showing up. The phrase Zara used. The practice Wei had taught. Presence as enough.

"I think I can do that," Amara said. "The showing up part."

"Me too."

They finished their tea in less uncomfortable silence. The conversation wasn't easy. Four years of absence didn't dissolve in one discussion. But it was start. Real start.

"I'm going back to Lagos Month 4," Amara said. "Zara invited me. I want to spend more time with Maya and Kofi before—" She couldn't finish.

"Before there isn't time," David completed quietly.

"Yes. Will you come? As—" She gestured uncertainly. "—friend? Ex-husband? I don't know what to call us yet."

David smiled slightly. First real smile she'd seen. "As someone who cares. Yes. I'll come."

"Really?"

"Really. I want to meet them. And I want to spend time with you. See if we can figure out what we are now."

Amara felt something warm in her chest. Not quite emotion. More like: potential for emotion. Hope that feeling might fully return.

"Thank you," she said.

"For what?"

"For not giving up completely. For being willing to try again. For still being here."

"You're here too," David pointed out. "That took courage."

Did it? It had felt like terror more than courage. But maybe they were the same thing.

Amara stood. "I should go. Let you process this. But—same time next week? Breakfast?"

"Breakfast," David agreed. "Where?"

"Community center? Neutral ground?"

"Good idea. Saturday, eight AM?"

"I'll be there."

David walked her to the door. They stood in the doorway awkwardly. Four years ago they'd been married. Now: strangers attempting reconnection. No script for this.

"Goodnight, Amara."

"Goodnight, David."

No kiss. No embrace. No physical intimacy. Just: acknowledgment. Agreement. Beginning.

Amara walked down the corridor toward the elevator. Looked back once. David was watching from his doorway. Their eyes met. Both smiled slightly—tentative, uncertain, but real.

She turned away and continued walking. Seven years left. Maybe they'd reconnect. Maybe they wouldn't. But at least they were trying. At least they were showing up.

That was progress. Small progress, but real.

---

Saturday morning, 8:03 AM. Amara arrived three minutes late—unusual for her, but she'd changed outfits four times, anxious about something as simple as breakfast. The community center dining area was nearly empty. Used to serve five hundred people daily. Now: maybe fifty. But still functioning. Still here.

David sat at a corner table, two cups of tea already steaming. He'd arrived early. Also nervous, apparently.

"Hi." Amara sat across from him.

"Hi. I got you tea. If you don't want it—"

"I want it. Thank you."

They collected food from the automated service line. Protein paste formed into pancake shapes, nutrient-enriched fruit, synthetic eggs that tasted almost right. The same food they'd eaten for years. Familiar.

Sitting back down felt monumental. First meal together in four years. Dating. This was dating.

"This is weird," Amara said.

David laughed—genuine, surprised. "Very weird. We were married sixteen years."

"And now we're nervous about breakfast."

"Maybe that's good. Means we care about getting it right this time."

They ate in slightly less awkward silence. Amara tried to think of conversation topics. What did people talk about on dates? She'd forgotten. It had been nineteen years since their first date. Different people then. Different world.

"How's work?" she tried.

"Same. Maintenance. Platform seventy-three. 47B sends regards."

"The robot sends regards?"

"I mentioned I was having breakfast with my ex-wife. 47B said that was statistically unusual and to proceed with optimal communication."

Amara smiled. "Robot advice. That's new."

"47B gives good advice, actually. Better than most humans I know."

"What else does 47B say?"

David relaxed slightly, talking about his work. The repairs. The patterns. How maintenance had become meditation, presence practice, meaning-making through showing up. He described it simply, without drama, but Amara heard the depth underneath.

"You found purpose in it," she observed. "The arrays."

"I did. Not because the work matters for the future. Because it matters now. Present-moment purpose. Wei's teaching, filtered through practice."

"I read Wei's letters," Amara admitted. "The ones she sent me Year 5 through Year 7. Zara gave them to me. Wei wrote that my work was holy. That bearing witness matters even when nothing lasts."

"Do you believe that?"

Amara considered. "I'm starting to. I tracked the asteroid for seven years while numb. Thought it was meaningless. Now I think—maybe documentation matters. Maybe saying 'this happened, we existed, we tried' is valuable even if the record itself ends."

"Same with maintenance. Arrays vaporize in seven years. But they provide power now. People need power now. Seven years of function is real."

They saw each other more clearly. Both had found purpose in work. Both had discovered presence through practice. Both had been preparing for this conversation without knowing it.

"Tell me about Lagos," David said. "What's Kofi like?"

Amara brightened—surprising herself. "He's joyful. That's the word Zara uses. Seven years old, always in motion, curious about everything. He chased butterflies in Wei's garden. Asked me if asteroids have feelings. Laughed when I said no but thanked them for asking."

"And Maya?"

"Brilliant. Ten years old and reading university-level physics. But not isolated like I was. She feels things. Has friends. Loves her brother fiercely. She asked me about orbital mechanics and then cried watching a sad film. I never managed that balance."

"You're managing it now. Talking about them with real warmth."

Was she? Amara noticed her voice, her expression. He was right. Thinking about Maya and Kofi made her feel. Not numbness. Actual emotion. Affection. Care. Maybe even love.

"The thawing is slow," she said. "But it's happening."

They talked for hours. Longer than planned. Conversation flowed more easily as they relaxed. David asked about her work—she'd transitioned to part-time monitoring, spending more time analyzing global data patterns instead of obsessive trajectory tracking. Amara asked about his colleagues—most gone now, maintenance run primarily by robots with four human supervisors.

"There's one other worker I see regularly," David added. "Ibrahim. Started about a year ago. Former militia fighter from Jerusalem. Lost his faith when the asteroid was detected. Spent years drifting, unemployed. Then took this job." He paused, considering. "We don't talk much. Work in parallel mostly. But there's something there. Shared understanding, maybe. Both of us finding purpose in showing up."

"Sounds like good company."

"It is. Quiet company. But real."

Eventually the dining area began filling with lunch crowd. They'd occupied the table four hours. Time to go.

"Walk?" David suggested.

They walked the residential district. Block after block of apartment buildings, engineered green spaces, the infrastructure of two billion people living at the bottom of the world. Antarctica in Year 8 was quieter than Year 0. Population declining. But still functioning. Still alive.

"I'm scared," Amara admitted suddenly.

"Of what?"

"Of this working. Of letting myself care about you again. Of spending seven years rebuilding something just to lose it. Again. Permanently this time."

David was quiet for several steps. Then: "I'm scared too. Of trying and failing again. Of opening up and being pushed away. Of spending seven years wondering if I should have stayed divorced."

"So we're both terrified."

"Apparently."

"Should we do it anyway?"

David stopped walking. Turned to face her. "I think so. I think trying is better than wondering. Even if we fail again. Even if it hurts. Seven years of trying beats seven years of isolation."

Amara looked at him—this man she'd married twenty years ago, divorced four years ago, was attempting to know again now. He was right. Trying was better than hiding.

"Okay," she said. "We try. Small steps. No pressure. Just—showing up."

"Just showing up," David echoed.

They continued walking. Didn't hold hands. Didn't touch. Just walked parallel, two people attempting connection after years of separation. Small beginning. But beginning nonetheless.

---

Month 3. They'd had breakfast together eight times. Dinner twice. One movie—terrible disaster film that felt inappropriately timed given everything. They'd laughed about it afterward, the absurdity of entertainment about asteroids when real asteroid was approaching.

Communication improved. Daily messages now, not logistics but actual conversation. Amara sharing her day. David sharing his. Small details. Real presence.

But also: difficult moments. Week 6, Amara cancelled breakfast without explanation. David felt the old pattern—her withdrawing, him wondering if he'd done something wrong. He reached out: "Are you okay?"

Three hours later: "No. Had panic attack. Thinking about seven years left. Couldn't face breakfast. Sorry."

This was different. Old Amara would have said nothing. Current Amara was trying. Acknowledged the withdrawal. Explained instead of vanishing.

David responded: "No apology needed. Want to talk?"

"Not yet. Tomorrow maybe?"

"Tomorrow's fine. I'm here."

They talked the next day. Amara explaining: she'd been tracking mortality statistics. Three billion dead since detection. Seven years remaining. The math made her spiral. Reminded her of Year 0 numbness. She'd barely fought it off.

"I'm still fragile," she admitted. "Still close to retreating."

"I know," David said. "I'm fragile too. Some days the maintenance feels pointless. Why fix what ends anyway? I have to remind myself: presence matters. Now matters."

They were honest. That was progress. Showing each other the broken parts instead of hiding them.

Week 10, David had bad day. Robot 47B malfunctioned—first serious failure in their partnership. Required reset, lost three weeks of learned patterns. David came to their dinner obviously upset.

"What happened?" Amara asked.

He explained. Amara listened. Really listened, not just waiting for her turn to speak. When he finished, she said: "That sounds hard. Losing the connection you'd built."

"It's stupid. 47B is just a robot."

"No," Amara disagreed. "47B is your colleague. Your partner. Losing that connection matters. You're allowed to grieve it."

David looked at her with surprise. "Thank you. For understanding that."

"I'm trying to understand. Still learning how. But trying."

These small moments of seeing each other—really seeing—accumulated. Built foundation. Not fixed. Not healed completely. But: progress.

---

Month 4, Week 1. Amara raised the Lagos trip again.

"Still planning to go?" David asked.

"Yes. Two weeks, Month 4, Week 3. Zara's expecting me. Are you still coming?"

"If the invitation stands."

"It stands. I want you there. Want you to meet Maya and Kofi. See what Zara built. Meet the community." She paused. "And I want us to have time together. Outside Antarctica. Away from work. See if we function as more than breakfast companions."

David smiled. "Two weeks in Lagos. Together but not living together. Neutral ground. Testing compatibility."

"Exactly."

"I'm in."

They planned the trip. Separate sleeping arrangements—Zara had guest room for Amara, community housing for David. Meals together but not constant. Space but proximity. Testing whether connection could deepen.

"I'm nervous," Amara admitted.

"Me too. But good nervous, maybe?"

"Maybe."

The night before departure, David brought Amara to the arrays.

"You wanted to see my work," he said. "Properly. Not just hear about it."

They took the transport to Sector 7. Darkness broken by work lights. David led her to platform seventy-three—his platform, the one he'd maintained for nine years.

"This is it," he said simply.

They climbed two hundred meters. Amara nervous about height. David patient, supportive, showing her the handholds. At the top: solar arrays stretching forever. Systems humming. Stars visible above, Antarctica glowing below.

"This is beautiful," Amara breathed.

"This is home," David said. "Where I found purpose. Where I learned presence. Where I've spent nine years maintaining what will end."

Robot 47B glided over, newly reset but still recognizable. *Beep beep.*

"Good evening, Colleague Chen. Visitor presence detected. Good evening, Visitor."

"This is Amara," David said. "My—" He paused, uncertain.

"Friend," Amara finished. Not ex-wife. Not girlfriend. Friend felt right.

"Good evening, Friend Amara. Welcome to Platform Seventy-Three."

They sat on the platform while David performed evening inspection. Amara watched him work—methodical, present, competent. Saw what he'd found here: meaning in maintenance, purpose in showing up, meditation in routine. She understood now. Really understood.

"Thank you for bringing me here," she said when he finished.

"Thank you for coming."

They descended together. Tomorrow: Lagos. Two weeks together. Testing whether breakfast companions could become something more. Testing whether broken people could rebuild connection. Testing whether seven years was enough time to try.

At the ground, they stood by the transport, departure in twelve hours.

"Goodnight," David said.

"Goodnight."

Still no kiss. Still no physical intimacy. But: warmth. Care. Possibility.

Amara went home to her station dormitory. Packed for Lagos. Thought about two weeks with David, with Zara's family, attempting to bridge four years of divorce and seven years of isolation.

She was terrified. But trying anyway.

That was progress. Real progress.

Tomorrow: Lagos. Together.

---

The transport climbed through Antarctic atmosphere, Africa approaching below. David sat beside Amara, both nervous, both excited, both scared.

"Seven years left," Amara said quietly.

"Seven years," David confirmed.

"Enough time?"

"To rebuild connection? To become something more than ex-spouses attempting breakfast? I don't know. But enough time to try."

"I'm glad we're trying."

"Me too."

The transport descended toward Lagos. Below: megacity sprawling across West African coast. Two hundred million people. Zara's home. Maya and Kofi waiting. Professor Wei's garden maintained by the community. Life continuing despite extinction.

David reached over. Took Amara's hand. First physical contact in four years.

She didn't pull away. Squeezed back.

Small gesture. Enormous meaning.

The transport landed. They disembarked hand in hand. Zara waiting at the gate with Maya and Kofi, both children excited to meet Uncle David for first time.

Amara looked at David. Saw him seeing her family. Saw possibility. Saw connection attempting to form.

"Ready?" she asked.

"Ready."

They walked forward together. Toward family. Toward community. Toward trying. Toward hope.

Seven years left. Maybe not enough time to fix everything. But enough time to try.

That was something. Maybe even enough.
