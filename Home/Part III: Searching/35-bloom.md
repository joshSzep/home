# Chapter 35: Bloom

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 11, Month 8 | Lagos District**

---

Wei is dying.

Not from the asteroid. Natural death. The body finishing its transformation after 125 years. Zara has been caring for her daily for three months now—bathing, feeding, moving her from bed to chair and back. Every touch is love. Every gesture is honor. Every moment is preparation for what's coming.

The apartment is quiet this morning. Ling, Wei's regular caregiver, stepped out for supplies. Zara sits beside the bed, watching Wei's chest rise and fall. Shallow breaths. Labored. The body working harder for what used to be automatic. 

Wei's eyes open. Clear. Sharp. The body failing but consciousness persisting.

"Good morning," Zara says softly.

"Morning." Wei's voice is thin but steady. "Water?"

Zara helps her drink. Wei's hands shake too much to hold the cup. This intimacy—helping someone drink, helping someone live—is profound. Physical care as sacred work. Vulnerability as teaching.

"How long?" Wei asks.

"Since you woke?"

"No. How long do I have?"

Zara's trained as an engineer, not a doctor. But she's seen enough dying to recognize the signs. The color. The breathing. The way Wei's body is shutting down system by system. "Days. Maybe a week."

"Good." Wei closes her eyes. "Ready."

Ready. The word Wei has used for months. Not afraid. Not resisting. Just: ready. After 125 years of living, ready to stop. After seventy years of teaching impermanence, ready to demonstrate it. After decades of practice, ready for the final practice.

"Are you in pain?" Zara asks.

"Some. Bearable." Wei opens her eyes again. "Don't want drugs. Want to be present. Clear. Want to see the ending."

Dr. Tanaka offered palliative medication three days ago. Wei refused. "Dying is the one certainty," she'd said. "I want to witness it fully. Not numbed. Not blurred. Conscious until consciousness ends. That's the practice."

Zara understands intellectually. But watching someone choose discomfort for the sake of presence—that's different. That's Wei's teaching made flesh. Literally.

"The children?" Wei asks.

"They'll visit this afternoon. Like always."

"Good. Want to see them. Want them to see me." Wei pauses, gathering strength. "First death they'll witness. Preparing them. For what's coming. For their own."

Maya will be seventeen at impact. Kofi will be fourteen. Both will die young. This death—Wei's natural death, peaceful death, ready death—is teaching them how. Showing them what's possible. Not making it easy. Making it real.

---

Afternoon brings voices. Footsteps. Life entering the apartment.

Maya arrives first. Nearly fourteen now—tall, serious, carrying a book like always. She approaches the bed carefully. "Grandmother Wei?"

Wei's face softens. Maya has called her grandmother for years. Not blood relation. Choice relation. Love relation.

"Maya. Come. Sit."

Maya sits on the edge of the bed, holding Wei's hand. The hand is thin, cold, shaking. Maya doesn't pull away.

"You brought a book," Wei observes.

"The butterfly one. You gave it to me. I thought..." Maya's voice catches. "I thought I could read to you."

"Please."

Kofi bursts in next—nearly eleven, all energy despite the circumstances. He stops when he sees Wei. The energy dims but doesn't disappear. "Professor Wei. You look..."

"Dying," Wei supplies. "The word is dying. Don't hide from it."

"Dying," Kofi repeats. Testing the word. Making it real.

"Yes. Soon. Days. But right now: here. With you. That's what matters."

Kenji enters quietly. Thirty-three years old now. Three years since he found Wei's garden in Lagos, exhausted from seeking, ready to stop. Three years of learning presence through watering plants. Three years of transformation. He's become a teacher himself—Wei's teaching spreading through him to others.

Behind him: Amara and David. Visiting from Antarctica, here for two weeks. They come every few months now—family reconnected, relationship healing. Amara sees Wei and her face crumples. Another ending. Another loss. Another reminder that nothing lasts.

Last through the door: Dr. Yuki Tanaka. Maya and Kofi's pediatrician since birth. Forty-nine years old, trained in Tokyo, specialized in child development when that specialty meant something. Now she attends Wei's teachings, practices presence medicine, transforms her clinical work into witness-work. She carries her medical bag but comes today as student, not doctor.

"Everyone's here," Wei says. "Good. I have strength today. Want to teach."

Zara helps Wei sit up slightly. Pillows arranged. Breathing easier in this position. The room fills—Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi, Kenji, Amara, David, Dr. Tanaka. Eight people around one dying woman. Bearing witness. Being present. Loving what they'll lose.

---

Wei looks at each person. Seeing them. Really seeing them. This is what she's taught for seventy years—attention. Presence. Witnessing fully.

"Thank you," she begins. Voice thin but clear. "For being here. For learning. For practicing. For staying present even when presence is difficult."

She pauses. Breathes carefully. "I'm dying. Natural death. My body reached its limit. Cells stopped renewing. Systems shutting down. This is right. This is how it should be. Not tragedy. Just: biology. Impermanence made visible."

Maya squeezes Wei's hand. Kofi is crying quietly. Kenji's face is composed but his eyes are wet.

"Kofi," Wei says. "Why are you crying?"

"Because you're dying."

"Yes. That's appropriate. Grief is right response to loss. But notice—I'm not dead yet. Right now, alive. Right now, teaching. Right now, together. Can you be sad about future AND present to now?"

Kofi considers. Nods. "Both."

"Both. Yes. Good student." Wei smiles slightly. "Grief and presence aren't opposites. Feel sad. Be here anyway. That's wisdom."

She looks at Maya. "You're afraid."

Not a question. Statement.

Maya nods. "Will it hurt?"

"Dying? I don't think so. The impact will be fast. But Maya—even if it hurts, the hurt is temporary. Everything temporary. Fear the pain less than missing your life because you're afraid."

"But we're going to die so young."

"Yes. You'll be seventeen. Not enough years. Never enough. But years don't measure life quality. Presence does. Better seventeen years awake than eighty years asleep."

Maya absorbs this. The book in her lap—*The Butterfly Life Cycle*. Gift from Wei years ago. Teaching about transformation, impermanence, beauty in brief lives.

Wei turns to Zara. "You've been practicing eleven years. Since detection. Every morning in my garden. Learning presence through your children. Through engineering. Through ordinary life made extraordinary by attention. You're ready."

"Ready for what?"

"For four more years. For witnessing your children's complete lives. For being present to every moment they have left. For dying awake with them. You're ready. Trust the practice."

Zara is crying. "I don't feel ready."

Her chest tightens. An image flashes—Maya at seventeen, standing in this garden, facing the asteroid. Zara can't breathe around it. Can't make it okay. Can't fix it. Just: witness it.

"No one does. Ready doesn't mean unafraid. Means willing to be present despite fear. You are that. You've been that for eleven years."

Wei looks at Amara and David. "You two reconnected. Three years now. Marriage healing. Soon you'll migrate to Lagos together—Year 13. Final two years with family instead of alone. This is wisdom. Choosing connection over work. Choosing presence over purpose. Proud of you both."

Amara wipes her eyes. David is silent, respectful, witnessing.

Dr. Tanaka stands slightly back. Professional distance dissolving over two years of attending teachings. Wei sees her.

"Yuki. You treat children who'll die young. Your whole specialty—child development—became absurd. Growth toward nothing. But you stayed. You transformed your practice. Now you witness children's complete lives instead of measuring progress toward futures. That's sacred work. Don't diminish it."

Dr. Tanaka bows slightly. "Thank you, Professor."

---

Wei's breath is laboring. This teaching taking energy she barely has. But she continues.

"Kenji. Come closer."

Kenji moves to the bedside. Wei reaches for his hand. Holds it with shaking fingers.

"Seven years since Tokyo. Since Roshi told you: Picture One. Still seeking. You didn't believe him. Kept running—Cairo, Mumbai, finally here. Year 8, Month 8. Exhausted. Ready to stop."

"I remember."

"You've been with me three years. Watering plants. Practicing presence. Learning to teach. Two years now, teaching others. Picture Five, I told you. Taming the ox. Still effort but cooperation emerging. You asked about the remaining pictures. The journey's end. I said: later. When you're ready. Now is later."

Kenji's attention sharpens. Everyone in the room listening. This is Wei's final teaching. Last transmission. The completion of what she's been preparing Kenji to receive.

"Picture Six," Wei says. "Riding the Ox Home. Boy on ox, playing flute. No rope needed. No struggle. Effortless practice. Teaching can begin because practice is natural now. Kenji—you're here. You've been here two years. Teaching others not from achievement but from practice. From being present alongside them. Picture Six is where you are now."

Kenji nods. He knows this. Has felt it emerging—the ease of practice, the naturalness of presence, the ability to guide others.

"Picture Seven: Ox Forgotten, Self Alone. The ox disappears. Teaching so internalized it becomes invisible. You don't practice presence anymore—you ARE present. Not following technique—you ARE the technique. The separation between practitioner and practice dissolves. This is next. This is where you're going."

Wei pauses. Breathing carefully. The room completely silent. Everyone holding this moment.

"You'll know Picture Seven when you stop noticing you're practicing. When sitting is just sitting. Walking is just walking. Teaching is just teaching. No meta-awareness. No self-consciousness about being present. Just: here. That might take years. Or might happen suddenly. Doesn't matter. The pictures aren't achievement ladder. They're description of what naturally unfolds through practice."

Wei closes her eyes. Breath laboring. The teaching taking everything.

Maya shifts on the bed. Kofi wipes his face. The room breathes with Wei—everyone synchronized to her rhythm, her pauses, her presence.

Wei opens her eyes. Looks at Kenji once more.

"Picture Eight," she continues quietly. "Both Ox and Self Forgotten. Empty circle. No boy, no ox, no landscape. Pure presence without subject or object. Cannot describe. Cannot explain. Cannot teach. You'll know it if you reach it. Most don't. I haven't. That's okay. Picture Six is enough. Picture Seven is enough. Eight is possibility, not requirement."

Kenji listens. Not trying to grasp. Just: receiving.

"Picture Nine." Wei's voice strengthens slightly. This one matters. "Returning to the Source. Cherry blossoms, stream, tree branches. Natural world being itself. No boy, no ox. Just: what is. The teaching reveals that source was always here. You never left. The journey was discovering you never went anywhere."

She squeezes Kenji's hand. "Home was always home. That's Picture Nine. Understanding that seeking was obstacle. That enlightenment isn't somewhere else. That Buddha-nature was never lost. That presence is natural state obscured by seeking. The ox was always you. The journey was returning to where you never left."

Tears stream down Kenji's face. "Home."

"Yes. Home. Your mother governs from home. Shows up daily. Bears witness. Never needed to seek because she was always present to her work. Different than your seeking. Better? No. Same destination. Different path. She lives Picture Nine naturally. You had to journey to discover what she never lost."

Wei looks at everyone. "That's why asteroid doesn't matter. Can't lose home because home isn't place. Home is presence. Home is here. Always here. Never gone. You're all home right now. In this room. Witnessing my death. Being present to loss. This is home. Nothing to seek. Nowhere to go. Just: here."

The silence is profound. Everyone understanding simultaneously. The novel's title. *Home.* Not place you arrive at. State you recognize you never left.

"Picture Ten," Wei says quietly. "Entering the Marketplace with Gift-Bestowing Hands. Laughing Buddha. Big belly. Huge smile. Carrying gifts. Returns to ordinary world. Not staying in mountain monastery. Coming down to help others. Teaching naturally. Giving wisdom, compassion, presence. The journey completes by returning to beginning—but transformed."

She looks at Kenji. "You're already doing this. Teaching in Antarctica now—your mother wrote me. Twice weekly gatherings. People coming to practice. You're in the marketplace, offering gifts. Picture Ten. That's completion. Not solitary enlightenment. Compassionate action. Helping others journey from Picture One to Picture Ten. The cycle continues through you."

Kenji can't speak. Just bows. Hands in gassho. Receiving. Honoring. Understanding.

"The teaching is complete," Wei says. "You have everything you need. Teach it. Share it. Help others wake up. For four years. Then everyone dies. But those four years—make them count. Make them presence. Make them home."

She looks at Maya and Kofi. Final words for them.

"Don't rush to be older," Wei says. "Practice being exactly the age you are. Youth is not incomplete. It's complete for its length. Fourteen is whole. Seventeen is whole. However many days you have—they're enough if you're present to them."

---

Wei is exhausted. This teaching took everything. She closes her eyes, breathing shallow.

Dr. Tanaka moves forward. Checks pulse, listens to breath sounds. Her face is professional but her eyes are awed. She's never witnessed someone teach while dying. Someone use death as curriculum.

"She needs rest," Dr. Tanaka says quietly.

But Wei opens her eyes once more. Looking at everyone. Seeing them. Being seen.

"Thank you," she says. Voice barely audible. "For letting me witness your lives. For learning presence. For loving despite loss. This is everything. You will continue. You will bloom. You will matter. Then: you will fade. As I fade. As everything fades. Beautiful."

Her breath slows. Everyone instinctively reaches out—touching her hand, her arm, her blanket. Connected. Present. Together.

Wei speaks once more. Three words. Final teaching.

"The flower bloomed."

Then: eyes closing. Breath slowing further. Stillness spreading.

Zara leans close. "Wei?"

No response. The breath stops. Starts again. Stops. One more shallow inhale. Then: nothing.

Silence.

Complete silence.

Professor Mei-Lin Wei, 125 years old, teacher, gardener, philosopher, witness, has finished her transformation.

---

The weeping starts quietly. Maya sobbing into Zara's shoulder. Kofi crying openly, not ashamed. Kenji's tears streaming down but his face peaceful. Amara holding David, both grieving this woman who taught them presence through letters and visits and the simple act of showing up.

Dr. Tanaka checks for pulse. Confirms what everyone knows. "She's gone."

But also: she's here. The body on the bed. The teaching in their minds. The practice in their lives. Gone and present simultaneously. Impermanence made visible.

Zara holds Wei's hand even though Wei can't feel it anymore. The hand is cooling already. Body temperature dropping. Cells beginning their final breakdown. Biology continuing its process. Nothing tragic. Nothing wrong. Just: natural. The cycle completing.

"She was ready," Kenji says. Voice thick with tears but steady. "So ready. Did you see? No fear. No resistance. Just: here. Present. Until the end. That's mastery. That's completion."

"She lived 125 years," Amara says. "Fourteen at detection. Lived eleven more years than predicted. Died naturally. Not from the asteroid. That's..." She searches for words. "That's mercy. That's grace."

David nods. "She escaped. Got to die her own death. On her own terms. Conscious. Present. Ready. Most of us won't get that."

The truth lands. Maya and Kofi will die from the asteroid. Sudden. Fast. No time to be ready. No gradual decline. Just: alive, then not. Wei's death is different. Better? Not better—different. Natural versus catastrophic. Prepared versus instant.

But Wei's teaching remains: presence to whatever comes. Ready or not. Fast or slow. Natural or violent. The practice is the same—being here fully until here ends.

---

They sit with the body for an hour. No rush. No urgency. Dr. Tanaka calls the funeral services but asks them to wait. This time matters. This presence matters. The transition from alive to dead to what comes next—this deserves witness.

Maya finally stops crying. Looks at Wei's face. "She looks peaceful."

"She was peaceful," Zara says. "Before death. During death. That's what practice gave her. Not immunity from dying. Peace with dying."

"Will we be peaceful?" Kofi asks. "When the asteroid comes?"

Zara doesn't know. Wants to lie and say yes. But Wei taught honesty. "I don't know. The impact will be fast. We'll have minutes, maybe. Not time for long goodbyes like this. But we can practice now. Every day until then. So when it comes, we're as present as possible. That's all we can do. That's what Wei taught."

Kenji speaks from the other side of the bed. "She gave us everything. The framework. The practice. The example. Four years left. We use them. We practice. We teach others. We help as many people as possible face the end awake. That's Picture Ten. That's the gift she left us."

Ling returns, sees what happened, sits down and cries. She's cared for Wei three years. Fed her. Bathed her. Changed her. Loved her. Loss is real even when expected.

The funeral service arrives. Respectful. Quiet. The smell of antiseptic follows them in—medical soap, disinfectant, the clinical scent of death-work. They've been doing this for eleven years—preparing bodies, handling death, witnessing humanity's grief. Wei's death is unique—natural, peaceful, old. Most deaths they handle are suicides, violence, accidents. This one is almost beautiful by comparison.

---

Wei wanted natural burial. She'd specified this months ago, written it down with shaking hands. "Ashes in my garden. Under the lemon tree. Return to soil. That's right."

The cremation happens that evening. The family doesn't attend—Wei didn't want witnesses for the burning. "The body is empty now," she'd said. "Consciousness gone. Just matter. Burn it. Transform it. Use it."

The next morning, they gather in Wei's garden. The space feels different—emptier, quieter, wrong somehow. Wei's wheelchair sits in the corner. Her watering can on the bench. Her tools arranged neatly. Everything ready for gardening that won't happen.

Except it will. Zara has promised to maintain this garden. She'll water the lemon tree. Tend the gardenias. Care for the herbs. Keep the teaching alive through continued practice. The garden will bloom until it can't—four more years, then vaporized like everything else. But those four years matter.

Kenji carries the urn. Simple ceramic container. Wei's ashes inside—125 years of life reduced to dust. Impermanence literal. Physical. Undeniable.

The ceremony is brief. No priest. No religious ritual. Just: people who loved Wei, gathering to return her to the garden she tended.

Zara speaks first. "Wei taught me presence through my children. Through ordinary life. Through flowers blooming and dying. She showed me that brief doesn't mean meaningless. That love matters precisely because it ends. That being present to what is—that's everything. I'll miss her. I'll miss her wisdom. I'll miss her garden teachings. But she's not gone—not completely. Her teaching lives in us. Lives through us. We'll carry it forward."

Kenji speaks next. Voice steady despite grief. "Wei saved me. Year 8, I arrived exhausted from seeking. Desperate. Lost. She told me to stop seeking and start being. Water plants. That's all. Just: water plants. Be present to work. Let presence emerge naturally. It did. Three years of learning. Three years of transformation. She gave me everything. The Ox-Herding Pictures. The framework for the journey. The understanding that home was always here. Now I teach others. Picture Ten. Marketplace with gift-bestowing hands. That's her legacy—not immortality, but transmission. Person to person. Until no more persons. Thank you, Wei. Thank you for everything."

Maya steps forward. Nearly fourteen, carrying herself differently than she did yesterday. Something changed watching Wei die. Something awakened.

"Grandmother Wei taught me about butterflies," Maya says. "About how caterpillars transform. About how everything blooms and dies and blooms again. I'm thirteen years, eleven months old. I have three years, eight months left. That's not enough time. But Wei showed me—it's enough to be present. Enough to practice. Enough to matter. I'll remember her. I'll practice what she taught. I'll die at seventeen but I'll die awake. That's what she gave me. That's what I'll honor."

Kofi doesn't speak. Too young for words. But he places a flower on the urn—gardenia bloom, white and fragrant, perfect. Offering from ten-year-old who watched his teacher die gracefully.

Others share briefly. Dr. Tanaka. Amara. David. Each person witnessing how Wei shaped them. How her teaching spread. How presence matters.

Then Kenji kneels by the lemon tree. The tree Wei grew from seed fifty-two years ago. Transported from Beijing. Tended through decades. Fruiting regularly. Four years left, like everyone.

He opens the urn. Pours Wei's ashes slowly into the soil around the roots. Grey dust settling into dark earth. Returning. Completing the cycle.

"Picture Nine," Kenji says quietly. "Returning to source. Home was always here. Wei understood. Now she demonstrates."

The ashes absorb into soil. Physical presence ending. But the garden remains. The lemon tree remains. The teaching remains. Wei transformed into earth, into nutrients, into what feeds the tree she loved.

It's perfect.

It's everything.

It's what she wanted.

---

After the ceremony, people linger. No rush to leave. The garden holds them. Wei's presence still palpable even though Wei is gone. Or maybe especially because Wei is gone—absence making presence visible.

Dr. Tanaka approaches Zara. "I've treated many terminal patients. Many deaths. But never one like that. Never someone so..." She searches for words. "So present. So ready. She wasn't fighting. Wasn't resigned. Just: there. Witnessing her own death. That was remarkable."

"That was practice," Zara says. "Seventy years of practice. She knew this was coming her whole adult life. Prepared for it daily. The meditation. The teaching. The constant attention to impermanence. When death arrived, she was ready. Not because she wanted to die. Because she'd practiced being present to mortality her entire life."

"Can we do that?" Dr. Tanaka asks. "In four years? Can we be ready like she was?"

"She said ready doesn't mean unafraid. Means willing to be present despite fear. So yes. Maybe. If we practice."

Dr. Tanaka nods. "I'll keep attending the teachings. Kenji's circle in Antarctica. When I return. I need this. My whole specialty—watching children grow—it's unbearable without practice. With practice, it's still unbearable but: bearable. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense."

They stand together in Wei's garden. Two mothers—one literal, one professional—both facing the impossible. Both choosing presence anyway. Both practicing what Wei taught.

---

That evening, the apartment is quiet. Children asleep. Kwame working at his desk. Zara sits alone on the balcony where Wei spent so many mornings.

The garden is dark. Silent. The lemon tree a shadow against the night sky. Wei's ashes now part of the soil, feeding the roots, continuing the cycle.

Zara thinks about Maya's question: "Will we be ready?"

She doesn't know. Wei had 124 years. Zara will have forty-eight. Maya will have seventeen. Kofi will have fourteen. Ready feels impossible.

But Wei said something else: "Present—that we can be."

Ready is different from present. Ready means prepared. Present means here. Zara can't prepare for the asteroid. Can't make seventeen years enough for Maya. But she can be present. Can practice with her children. Can witness their complete lives fully. Can love them until love ends.

Zara looks at the lemon tree. In the darkness she can barely see it. But she knows it's there. Knows Wei's ashes feed it now. Knows it will bloom again next season. Four more years of growth before the asteroid.

Four years. Enough time for the tree to fruit multiple times. Enough time for new gardenias to bloom. Enough time for presence. For practice. For teaching Maya and Kofi what Wei taught her.

Not enough time for everything. But enough time for what matters.

Wei's voice in memory: *The flower bloomed.*

Past tense. Completion. Not tragedy—acknowledgment. The gardenia bloomed for three days, then fell. Wei lived for 125 years, then died. Zara will live for forty-eight years total, then die. Maya for seventeen. Kofi for fourteen. All blooming. All fading. All temporary. All beautiful.

The grief sits heavy in Zara's chest. First death her children witnessed. First real loss. First visceral experience of impermanence. Maya's question revealed it: "Will we be ready?"

No, probably not. But present—that they can practice.

Zara stands. Waters the lemon tree one more time. The soil absorbs. The roots drink. Wei's ashes mixing with water, feeding the tree, continuing the cycle. Everything transforming. Everything temporary. Everything connected.

Tomorrow she'll bring the children back to the garden. They'll tend it together. Continue Wei's work. Practice Wei's teaching. Be present to what's here while it's here.

Four years left.

But right now: this moment. This garden. This tree. This breath. This presence.

That's home.

That's everything.

The flower bloomed.
