# Chapter 45: Offering

**Ibrahim al-Rashid | Year 14, Month 9 | Antarctica**

---

The meditation room is full.

Ibrahim counts without meaning to—habit from years of stairs, years of steps, years of needing structure. Thirty-seven people in the circle. More than last week. More every week, it seems. He sits in his usual spot, left side near the window, where he can see both Kenji at the front and the door. Old instincts. Fighter instincts. Always know the exits.

His leg aches from this morning's maintenance work. Seven years on the arrays—the body remembers the cold, the climbing, the compensating for damage that won't heal. He shifts slightly, finding the angle where the pain becomes bearable. Derek glances over, nods. The former Marine understands bodies that don't work right anymore. They've been swimming together three years now—Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Building 9 basement pool. Twenty-five laps. Ibrahim never imagined he'd swim twenty-five laps. But Derek kept inviting, kept showing up. Now Ibrahim helps orient new refugees. Shows them that broken bodies can still move.

Min-seo sits two cushions away—seventy years old now, frailer than when Ibrahim first knocked on her door asking about mint eight years ago. But still here. Still tending her balcony garden despite Antarctic winter. The mint thrives somehow.

Fatima arrives with her characteristic energy, greeting people quietly, finding her cushion. Jordanian woman who never lost faith but never judged Ibrahim for losing his. Fourteen years of dinners at her place. Behind her: Samir, the Deaf Syrian teacher, signing greetings to the people who've learned even basic signs. Ibrahim can sign *hello*, *thank you*, *I see you* now. Three years of lessons. Different mode of attention.

They kept him alive. These four. Years 6 through 14. Ibrahim hadn't known it while it was happening. Thought he was just surviving. But looking back: they were holding him.

Now, somehow, he's become someone others look to. Someone Kenji invites to speak. Someone young people ask questions. The transformation is uncomfortable. Unwanted. Ibrahim doesn't understand it. Maybe doesn't deserve it. But: real.

Chen and Kowalski sit near the front—both here every week for two years now. Seventy-five and seventy-one. Former UN Secretary General and security chief. They'd been practicing informally for twelve years before Kenji returned. Thursday coffee ritual. Morning meditation. When Kenji opened this teaching space Year 12, they'd arrived separately, seen each other, smiled recognition. Now they sit together like old friends.

After sessions, Chen sometimes shares stories—patient negotiation transformed into patient presence. Kowalski rarely speaks but when he does, everyone listens. Thirty-seven years maintaining security, bearing witness to collapse. Last week he'd said simply: "My job was impossible for decades. I did it anyway. That's presence." Ibrahim had felt recognition—maintenance workers understanding each other.

Obi Nwosu sits mid-circle, arms crossed but face open. Fifty-six years old. Three years of Lagos practice now—started skeptical Year 11, transformed into essential voice. The former infrastructure manager who'd spent nine years maintaining Lagos water systems before quitting Year 10 because futility became unbearable. Then Wei died. He'd been attending teachings barely one month when she passed. Something about her death, about witnessing someone die present rather than broken, shifted him. He stayed. Kept practicing. Kept showing up despite uncertainty.

When Ibrahim speaks during sessions now, Obi often adds his engineering perspective: "Maintenance taught me this without me knowing. Fix today what breaks today. That's complete." His skepticism gives others permission to doubt. His presence despite doubt gives them permission to practice anyway. "Three years ago I called this bullshit. Still not certain it matters. But I keep showing up." Honest. Real. Valuable.

Dr. Sarah Kim sits quietly observing—forty-six years old, former journalist who moderated the Year 2 election debate, now volunteer coordinator. Two years of practice transformed her from organizing logistics to accepting what can't be organized. She takes notes sometimes during sessions, old journalist habits, but her attention is different now. Not documenting. Witnessing.

Among the regulars: Soso Kim, near the back. Forty-nine years old, runs the District 12 Dog Adoption Center. Five years attending now. Ibrahim has watched her transformation—fierce environmentalist who grieved extinct species, now teaching others through animal care. Her center became a satellite teaching space Year 12.

After sessions she sometimes shares stories about volunteers learning to be present with unadoptable dogs. Last month Chen had said after hearing one: "Everything we maintain will end. Doesn't make maintaining less sacred."

Younger people scattered throughout the circle. Teenagers mostly—fifteen years old maximum. Ibrahim watches them arrive week after week. Scared. Brave. Angry. Some come alone. Some with parents. All carrying the same unbearable math: seventeen years maximum, then nothing.

One girl—maybe fourteen, Ibrahim doesn't know her name—has attended six weeks straight. Sits very still during meditation. Cries quietly sometimes. Asks hard questions after. Last week: "If I'm going to die at seventeen anyway, why does it matter if I'm present? Dead is dead." Kenji had answered gently, but Ibrahim saw the girl wasn't satisfied. Intellectual understanding isn't embodied understanding. She knows the words. Can't feel the truth yet. Maybe won't before she dies.

Teaching people who won't live long enough to master it. That's the work.

Kenji rings the small bell. The room quiets. Thirty-seven people settling into meditation posture—sitting, standing, kneeling, whatever works for their bodies. Ibrahim straightens slightly. Notices his breath. The familiar instruction: *Notice when mind wanders. Return gently. That's all. That's everything.*

He closes his eyes. Focuses on breath. In. Out. In. Out. Thoughts arise immediately—maintenance schedule for tomorrow, Platform 73 needing recalibration, Min-seo's birthday next week, the ache in his leg. He notices them. Returns to breath. Not fighting. Just: returning.

This is what David taught him. Not through words. Through seven years of working together. Showing up at 6:47 AM. Three minutes early. Consistent. Doing maintenance not because arrays would last forever but because they needed maintaining today. Ibrahim had absorbed it without knowing. Now David's gone—left Antarctica three months ago, Year 14 Month 6, moved to Lagos with Amara. Seven years of partnership ended. But the teaching remains. The transmission happened through being, not through speaking.

Now Ibrahim continues the arrays alone. Well, not alone—47B remains, faithful robot colleague. But without David's human presence. The work is the same. The meaning persists. That's the point. Practice continues whether teacher is present or not. Understanding internalized becomes self-sustaining.

Forty-five minutes pass. The bell rings.

Ibrahim opens his eyes. Notices the room. Thirty-seven people returning from wherever minds go during meditation. Some peaceful. Some frustrated. Some crying. All here. All showed up. All chose presence over escape, even briefly.

Kenji lets the silence settle. Then speaks quietly: "Today I want to talk about the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. For those new—these are Zen teaching images. Ten stages from lost to liberated. Picture One: seeking the ox. Not yet found. Just: seeking. That's where most spiritual journeys begin. Recognizing something's missing. Looking for it." He pauses. "I spent six years on Picture One. Tokyo, Cairo, Mumbai, finally Lagos. Seeking everywhere. Finding nothing. Exhausting myself with searching."

Ibrahim has heard this story before. Multiple times. But it lands differently each telling. Kenji's honesty about his own struggle gives everyone permission to struggle. No performance of having arrived. Just: honest accounting of journey still unfolding.

"Picture Two: finding traces," Kenji continues. "Seeing footprints. Evidence the ox exists. For me, that was Year 8 in Lagos. Finding Wei's garden. Seeing people practice presence. Understanding it was possible even if I couldn't do it yet. Traces that something real existed."

He looks around the circle. "Most of you are somewhere between Pictures One and Three. Seeking, finding traces, maybe glimpsing the ox briefly. That's normal. That's the work. Don't rush. Don't force. Just: keep practicing. Notice when you're present. Notice when you're not. Return gently."

A young man raises his hand. Maybe fifteen. Ibrahim has seen him three times now. "What if we never get past Picture One? What if we die still seeking?"

The question hangs. Honest. Painful. Real.

Kenji considers. "Then you die seeking. That's not failure. Seeking is practice too. Being present to your seeking is presence. The pictures aren't achievement ladder—they're description of what naturally unfolds. Some people reach Picture Ten. Some stay at Picture Three their whole lives. Duration doesn't determine value. Presence does."

The young man nods slowly. Not satisfied but accepting.

"Actually—" Kenji looks toward Ibrahim. "Would you speak to this? About practice without achievement?"

Ibrahim's chest tightens. He doesn't want to speak. Isn't qualified. Is just maintenance worker who lost faith and counts stairs obsessively and barely survived years of wanting death. What does he know about teaching?

But Chen is nodding. Kowalski too. Obi watching with interest. Min-seo's face shows gentle encouragement. And the young people—they're looking at him with something like hope. Like maybe someone who isn't a formal teacher, who isn't Elena Torres's son, who is just refugee worker, might have something real to say.

Ibrahim takes a breath. "I'm not a teacher."

"Wisdom isn't about being wise," Kenji says quietly. "It's about being present enough to speak truth."

The silence waits. Thirty-seven people watching.

Ibrahim speaks. Words coming before he decides to speak them.

"I fought for eight years," he says. Voice rough. "Jerusalem. Militia. Believed—" He stops. Starts again. "Believed fighting mattered. Defended holy land. Certain of purpose. Then the asteroid came. Year 0. During prayer. And I—" He pauses. This part still hard. "My faith shattered. Completely. If everyone dies together—righteous and wicked, believer and atheist—what's the point? What kind of God allows that?"

Several people nod. Recognizing the question. The crisis.

"I lost everything," Ibrahim continues. "Faith. Brothers. Purpose. Self. Got wounded Year 2. Evacuated to Antarctica Year 3. Arrived broken. Faithless. Wanted to die but lacked energy for suicide. Spent four years barely existing. Years 3 through 6. Unemployed. Aimless. Counting stairs obsessively because counting was only structure I had. Fifty-three steps to my apartment. Counted them every day. Multiple times. Because what else?"

He glances at Min-seo, Derek, Fatima, Samir. They know this story. Lived through it with him. Kept him alive when he didn't want to be kept alive.

"Then Year 7, I got maintenance work. Solar arrays. Didn't care about learning. Just needed something to do. Met David Chen—" He gestures vaguely upward. "He taught me—not lectured. Just worked. Showed up. Did maintenance because—" Ibrahim loses the thread. Tries again. "Seven years I watched him maintain arrays that will vaporize. But he did it anyway. Because today they need it. I don't—I didn't understand then. Maybe don't fully understand now. But something about that. Something."

The room is completely silent. Even the perpetual wind seems quieted.

"I asked him once," Ibrahim says. "Year 8. 'Why do you do this? Really. Why maintain arrays that will end?' He said: 'Because I can. Because it matters while it matters. Because showing up is enough.'" Ibrahim's voice cracks slightly. "I didn't believe him then. Didn't understand. Thought he was just avoiding futility. But he wasn't. He was demonstrating something. That purpose doesn't require permanence. That meaning isn't about outcomes. That maintenance is meditation. Presence made physical."

Obi leans forward slightly. Recognition visible on his face.

"Picture One, Two, Three—" Ibrahim continues. "I didn't know these teachings. Didn't study Buddhism. Didn't attend formal practice until Year 6. Just: worked. Counted stairs. Drank tea with Min-seo. Walked with Derek. Went to Fatima's dinners. Learned signs from Samir. Small things. Nothing dramatic. But they kept me alive. Kept me here. Kept me showing up."

He looks at the young man who asked the question. "You asked: what if we die still seeking?" Ibrahim pauses. Searching for truth. "Then you die seeking. But—" He stops. Contradicts himself. "No. That's not right. Maybe it's—if you're present to your seeking, that's different than not-seeking. You asked the question. You came here. That's something." He's fumbling now. "Someone wise said: brief life fully witnessed is complete life. I don't know if I believe that. But I think—maybe duration isn't the measure. Presence is. Maybe."

The young man's eyes are wet. "But I'll be seventeen. Never eighteen. Never adult."

"No," Ibrahim agrees. "Not enough time. Never enough. I'll be thirty-six when I die. Not enough either. But if you're present for your seventeen years—really present, really here—you'll know yourself. Won't know who you might have become. Will know who you are. That's—" He falters. "I don't know if that's enough. But it's what we have."

He's surprised himself. Didn't know he thought that until he said it. Full life isn't length. Maybe. Full life is depth. Presence. He thinks. Young people have less time. But time isn't the measure. Consciousness is. Or attention is. He's not certain. Just: speaking what feels true.

"I'm not wise," Ibrahim adds quickly. "Still counting stairs. Still limping. Still faithless. Still struggling. But I learned something through work, through community, through twelve years of barely surviving then suddenly realizing survival became living. Maybe full life isn't length. Maybe full life is depth. Presence. Being here completely. You have less time than me. I have less time than these elders—" He gestures to Chen and Kowalski. "But if we're present, we're full. That's complete."

Silence. Long silence. Ibrahim feels exposed. Vulnerable. Said too much. Revealed too much. Wants to disappear.

Then Chen speaks. Quiet but clear. "Fix today what breaks today. That's presence." He looks at Ibrahim directly. "You just named what I've been practicing forty years. Thank you."

Kowalski adds: "Thirty-seven years security work. Impossible job. Did it anyway. That's what Ibrahim just described. We're all dying young. Some younger than others. Doesn't change the practice."

Obi uncrosses his arms. "I spent nine years maintaining Lagos infrastructure. Quit Year 10 because futility destroyed me. Spent a year isolated, bitter. Then started practice—barely, reluctantly. Three years now. Listening to Ibrahim—I realize I was already doing this. Just didn't know it. Thought I'd failed. Actually: I'd been practicing."

Dr. Sarah Kim speaks for the first time in weeks. "I documented everything. Journalist instinct. Two years ago I came here exhausted. Seeking something deeper than efficiency. I maintain community connections now. Not fixing. Just: being present."

Soso Kim—from the back of the circle—adds: "I grieved species I'd never seen. Practice taught me: witnessing current life is complete. My twelve dogs—present with them is present with all life."

The room is charged now. Something happening. Not through Kenji's formal teaching. Through Ibrahim's offering. Worker speaking to workers. Broken speaking to broken.

The young people are watching with new attention. The fourteen-year-old girl who cried last week raises her hand. "So practice won't make dying okay? Won't fix the fear?"

Ibrahim looks at her. Really looks. "No. Practice doesn't fix anything. You'll be terrified. I'm terrified. We're all terrified. But—" He searches for words. "Practice means you're terrified AND present. Not numb. Not hiding. Here, feeling everything. That's different from drowning in terror. Presence doesn't make death okay. Makes life real."

She nods slowly. Understanding or accepting or both.

Then someone moves. The door opening. Ibrahim turns.

A woman enters. Blonde. Swedish. Thin—too thin, rail-thin, shaking hands. She hovers at the threshold. Uncertain. Afraid. Present despite fear.

Linnea.

Ibrahim knows her. Unit 418. Building 12. Same building as him, as Min-seo. Seen her in stairwells for eight years—Year 6 through Year 14. Always struggling. Always barely surviving. Derek, Fatima, Samir, Min-seo—they've all been helping. Bringing food. Checking in. Being present. But she's been too deep in her own drowning to surface. Until now. Until this moment.

Ibrahim catches Derek's eye. Derek nods once. *I invited her. She came.*

Linnea stands frozen. Thirty-six years old but looking older. Worn. Damaged. Real.

Ibrahim stands. His leg protests but he ignores it. Walks to her. Speaks quietly. "Linnea. You came."

"Ibrahim." Her voice is thin. Shaking like her hands. "You said—Derek said—this might help."

"It might. Or might not. But you're here. That's brave."

"I'm not brave."

"You're here despite fear. That's the definition."

He guides her gently to a cushion near where his group sits. Min-seo smiles welcome. Fatima touches Linnea's arm gently. Samir signs *hello*, *welcome*, *we see you*. Derek's face shows quiet satisfaction. Eight years keeping her alive. Eight years of patient presence. Eight years of refusing to let her disappear. And now: she's here. Choosing. Trying.

Ibrahim returns to his seat. But something has caught Kenji's attention. His teacher is staring at Linnea. Face arrested. Recognition flooding.

Ibrahim sees it happen. Kenji knows her. Somehow. Somewhen. The frozen expression. The breath catching. The past arriving in the present.

The moment stretches. Thirty-seven people becoming thirty-eight. The circle expanding. Room for one more broken person trying to be present.

Kenji recovers. Returns his attention to the group. But Ibrahim watches. Sees the tremor in Kenji's hands. The shift in his breathing. Something significant happened. Something he'll understand later.

---

The session continues. Kenji leads them through another brief meditation. Fifteen minutes. Linnea tries. Ibrahim can see her struggling—shaking hands pressed together, eyes squeezed shut, tears leaking. But she doesn't leave. Stays. Endures. Chooses presence despite every instinct screaming to run.

When the bell rings, Kenji invites questions. Several people ask about practice, about Pictures, about how to be present when terror overwhelms. Kenji answers patiently. But Ibrahim notices his teacher glancing toward Linnea. Seeing her. Remembering something.

An older woman—maybe fifty—asks: "How do we know if we're making progress? How do we measure?"

Chen answers before Kenji can. "You don't. Progress isn't measurable. Some days presence is easy. Some days impossible. But you keep practicing. That's all. That's enough."

Kowalski adds: "Thirty-seven years I showed up to impossible work. Never knew if I was succeeding. Just knew: today, I show up. Tomorrow, show up again. That's measurement. Did you show up? Yes? Then you succeeded."

Soso speaks: "I measure by whether I notice. Do I see the dogs today? Really see them? Not thinking about tomorrow or yesterday—just: these dogs, this moment, this life. If I notice, I'm present. If I don't, I return and try to notice. That's progress."

The session naturally winds down. People standing, stretching, talking quietly. The teenagers cluster together—finding each other, finding solidarity in shared impossible circumstance. The elders stay seated, continuing conversation. The middle generation—Ibrahim's generation—moves between groups, connecting, facilitating, being present.

Ibrahim watches this happen. Community forming. Not through doctrine or belief. Through shared practice. Chen was UN Secretary General. Kowalski security chief. Obi infrastructure manager. Soso runs animal shelter. Ibrahim maintains arrays. Different roles. Same practice.

Linnea hasn't moved. Still sitting on her cushion, hands shaking, face streaked with tears. Min-seo sits beside her. Doesn't speak. Just: presence. Being with someone in their pain without trying to fix it.

Derek approaches. Crouches beside Linnea. Signs something—Ibrahim catches *proud*, *you came*, *we're here*. Linnea nods. Can't speak. But nods.

Fatima joins them. Then Samir. The four who've kept Linnea alive gathering around her. Not crowding. Just: letting her know she's not alone. She's part of something. She's held.

Ibrahim remains at distance. Letting the moment unfold. This is their work. He helped bring her here—encouraged Derek, agreed she was ready, offered his testimony today that maybe helped. But now: they take over. Community holding community.

As people begin leaving, Kenji approaches Ibrahim. His teacher's face is complicated. Moved. Troubled. Grateful.

"That was wise," Kenji says quietly.

Ibrahim uncomfortable. "I'm not wise."

"You spoke truth. The young people heard you. The elders recognized you."

"Did it help?"

Kenji looks around the room. At the young people still talking. At Chen and Kowalski deep in conversation. At Linnea surrounded by community. "I don't know. But you offered. That's what matters."

Ibrahim nods. Uncomfortable with praise but accepting it. This is what practice taught him—uncomfortable is just feeling. Notice it. Don't fight it. Let it exist.

"The woman," Kenji continues carefully. "Linnea. I know her."

Ibrahim waits. Sensing something important.

"Year 0. Day 72. Lagos. I was—" Kenji pauses. "Spiraling. Substances. She was at a party. We both used. Both fell apart that night. I saw her once more—Year 5, Mumbai. Deep in addiction. I couldn't help. Was barely surviving myself."

He looks toward Linnea. "Now: fourteen years later. She's here. And Ibrahim—you brought her. You and the others kept her alive. That's—" His voice cracks. "That's what this practice is for. Holding each other. Being community."

Ibrahim feels something shift. He didn't just maintain arrays these years. He became part of something. Chosen family. Refugee community. And through that, people like Linnea survive. People like him survive. Everyone holding everyone else.

"Kenji?" Linnea's voice from across the room. Tentative. Recognizing.

Kenji turns. They see each other. Really see each other. Fourteen years between that Lagos party and this Antarctica meditation room. Two people who started at the same point—both using, both drowning, both desperately seeking oblivion. Now: here. Both practicing. Both alive. Both choosing presence over escape.

Kenji walks toward her. Ibrahim watches. Two survivors recognizing each other.

But before Kenji reaches her, Linnea speaks. Voice stronger than Ibrahim expected. "You're the deflection boy."

"Kenji."

"You took two pills. I took the third." She's crying but not hiding it. "You got out."

"So did you. You're here."

"Barely. Took me fourteen years."

Kenji kneels beside her. Eye level. "Ibrahim brought you. That means you're trying."

She almost smiles. "He's kept me alive. Him, Min-seo, Derek, Fatima, Samir. Eight years."

"Then you have community. That's more than I had Year 0."

Long pause. Two people acknowledging parallel paths. Different outcomes but same struggle. Same humanity. Same brokenness. Same survival.

"Will you come back next week?" Kenji asks.

Linnea hesitates. Ibrahim sees the fear. The doubt. But she says: "I don't know if I can do this."

"Come anyway. Practice isn't about being good at it."

She nods. Small. Tentative. "Okay."

Kenji stands. Offers his hand. Helps her up. Her legs are unsteady but she doesn't fall. Derek moves to her side—supporting without smothering. They leave together: Linnea, Derek, Min-seo, Fatima, Samir. Five refugees who found each other through broken circumstances. Five people who kept each other alive through nothing years. Now: witnessing each other's survival. Witnessing each other's choice to try.

---

The room empties. Only Ibrahim, Kenji, Chen, Kowalski, and Obi remain.

The silence is comfortable. Shared. Five people who understand something similar. That work is practice. That maintenance is meditation. That showing up is enough.

Chen speaks first. "What Ibrahim offered today—that's what I've been seeking. Language for experience."

Kowalski nods. "Governance, infrastructure, security, arrays—all the same. That's what survives after belief systems collapse. That's what we pass forward."

Obi looks at Ibrahim directly. "Three years ago I called this bullshit. Thought presence was surrender. You proved me wrong. Not through philosophy. Through living. You're broken. You have no faith. But you're present. That's proof."

Ibrahim doesn't know what to say. These men—elder statesmen, infrastructure managers, security chiefs—looking to him for something. He barely sees it in himself. It's uncomfortable. But also: real. Maybe he has become something. Or maybe he just survived long enough that surviving looks like wisdom. Through twelve years of showing up when showing up seemed pointless. Through letting community hold him. Through stairs and tea and swimming and—today—words that maybe helped.

"Two years left," Ibrahim says quietly. "Then we all die. What we built—this community—ends. Was it worth it?"

The question hangs. Honest. Painful.

Kenji answers. "Wei taught me: completion isn't about duration. If we're fully here for two years, we're complete. The ending doesn't negate the practice."

Chen adds: "I coordinated humanity for eight years. Accomplished nothing. But I showed up. That was my work. Same with this. We won't save anyone. But we'll help them be present."

Kowalski stands slowly. Seventy-one years old. Body protesting. But present. "Two years left. Not enough time. But enough time to practice. Enough time to matter." He looks at each of them. "Thank you for showing up."

They stand. Five people in empty meditation room. Community. Chosen family.

Ibrahim feels something he hasn't felt since Jerusalem. Not faith returning—that's gone, permanently. But: belonging. These people—Kenji who teaches, Chen who witnessed, Kowalski who maintained, Obi who questions—they see him. Really see him. And in being seen, he exists. Not as fighter. Not as believer. As person who shows up despite having every reason not to.

That's enough.

They leave together. Walking out into Antarctic evening. The arrays above, humming their endless electric song. Two years until extinction. But right now: here. Together. Practicing.

---

Walking back to Building 12 with Min-seo and Samir. The three of them moving slowly—Min-seo's age, Ibrahim's limp, Samir's careful attention to surroundings. Different ways of being in the world. Different challenges. Same practice.

Samir signs something. Ibrahim catches most of it: *Today was good. Your words helped.*

"Not teacher," Ibrahim signs back clumsily. "Just worker."

Samir smiles. Signs: *Same thing. You teach through being honest.*

They reach Building 12. Their building. Home for eight years. Fifty-three steps ahead. Ibrahim has counted them thousands of times. Obsessively at first. Habitually now. Just: awareness. One step. Another. Another. All the way up.

Min-seo pauses at the second floor. Her landing. "Friday tea?" she asks.

"Friday tea," Ibrahim confirms.

"Good." She touches his arm. "Ibrahim. Today you spoke. That's new. I remember when you first came to my door. Year 6. Broken. Silent. Look at you now."

"I'm not different," Ibrahim says.

"You are. Eight years changes people." She looks at both of them. "Showing up for each other, year after year—that's love. Thank you for showing up."

She enters her apartment. Ibrahim and Samir continue up. Third floor. Fourth floor. Fifty-three steps total.

At the fourth floor landing, Samir signs: *You helped Linnea today.*

"We all did," Ibrahim signs back. "All of us together. That's how it works."

Samir nods deeply. Signs: *Goodnight. Keep practicing.*

Ibrahim enters Unit 403. Seven years here. Same small apartment. Same sparse furniture. Same window overlooking courtyard. Same mint plant on sill—cuttings from Min-seo, still growing, green and alive despite Antarctic winter.

He makes tea. Sits at his small table. Looks out at the courtyard. Derek's building. Samir's building. Fatima's in the distance. Min-seo below. Linnea somewhere above.

Eight years of proximity becoming family.

Two years left. But tonight: here. Together.

Ibrahim's prayer beads sit on the shelf. Ninety-nine names of God he doesn't believe in anymore. He doesn't reach for them. Doesn't need them. The practice has replaced what faith used to provide. Structure. Meaning. Not to God. To people.

That's enough.

He drinks his tea slowly. Tastes it. Mint sharp and clean. Water warm. Cup solid in damaged hands. All of it real. All of it here now.

Tomorrow: Platform 73. Maintenance work. Swimming with Derek. Check on Linnea. See Min-seo. Live his ordinary life through attention.

Two years until everyone dies. Thirty-three when he arrived. Thirty-six at impact. He survived when he wanted death. Found community when he thought connection impossible. Offered something when he thought himself empty.

That's not nothing.

Ibrahim finishes his tea. Notices he finished it. That's practice—noticing the drinking. Being present to ordinary moments.

He stands. Stretches. His leg aches. Will ache until he dies in two years. That's just reality. Noticed reality. Accepted reality. Present reality.

Tomorrow he'll show up. Platform 73 at 6:47 AM. Three minutes early. Consistent. Reliable. Present. That's his practice. That's his offering. That's how he loves.

The flower will bloom. For two more years. Then fall. But the blooming—that's real. That's whole. That's complete.

Ibrahim turns off the light. Lies down. Closes his eyes.

Sleep comes.

And with it: peace. Not happiness. Not faith. Not certainty.

Just: peace with the uncertainty. Peace with the emptiness that's no longer empty. Peace with dying in two years because the two years are real. Peace with being Ibrahim—broken, faithless, limping, counting stairs, but also: present, choosing to show up.

That's enough.

That's home.
