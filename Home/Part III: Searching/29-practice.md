# Chapter 29: Practice

**Kenji Torres | Year 9, Month 9 | Lagos District**

---

The lemon tree needs water.

Kenji fills the watering can from the rain barrel, movements automatic after thirteen months. Dawn breaks over Lagos District—humid, bright, the engineered tropical climate predictable as mathematics. Through the balcony railing he sees the megacity waking: five million people beginning another day in Year 9, with less than six years remaining. Still building. Still working. Still tending gardens on balconies.

He waters the tree carefully, watching soil absorb. The tree is fifty-one years old now. Wei grew it from seed in Beijing, transported it through three cities, one lifetime. In six years it burns. But today it needs water.

That's all practice is. Water the tree. Not because watering saves it. Because today it's thirsty.

"Good morning, student." Wei's voice from the doorway. She's in her wheelchair, 119 years old, hands shaking as she wheels herself toward her morning position by the gardenias. Ling helped her dress an hour ago—Wei can't manage alone anymore. Body failing incrementally. Mind sharp as ever.

"Good morning, Teacher." Kenji moves to the gardenias. Checks the soil. Dry. Waters them slowly.

"You're present today," Wei observes.

"Am I?"

"More than yesterday. Less than tomorrow, maybe. Progress isn't linear."

Kenji smiles. Thirteen months ago—Year 8, Month 8—he'd arrived in Lagos exhausted, desperate, carrying six years of seeking that led nowhere. Met Wei in this garden. Stayed for tea, then dinner, then the night. Woke the next morning to her greeting: "Ready to learn nothing?" He'd said yes without understanding what nothing meant.

Now he understands. Nothing isn't absence. It's presence without concepts. Being here without the endless analysis. Watering plants because plants need water, not because watering plants leads to enlightenment which leads to peace which solves mortality which...

The recursive trap. He still falls into it. But less. Maybe.

"The mint needs cutting back," Wei says. "Getting aggressive."

Kenji moves to the mint. Korean variety—cuttings from Min-seo in Antarctica, sent with Amara during her visit Month 3. The plant is thriving, threatening to overtake its container. He finds the shears, begins trimming. The scent fills the morning—sharp, clean, alive.

"What are you thinking?" Wei asks.

"About the mint. How fast it grows. How it'll burn in six years. Whether trimming it matters."

"Does it matter?"

Kenji considers. Thirteen months ago he would have said: intellectually no, existentially maybe, depending on how we define mattering, which requires framework for meaning in meaningless universe, which... Now he just feels into the question. Holds the mint cutting in his hand. Smells it. The plant is too large. Trimming helps it. That's enough.

"Yes," he says simply. "It matters because I'm doing it."

Wei nods. "You're learning."

---

They water the garden together in silence. This is the practice Wei teaches—not philosophy seminars, not meditation marathons, not elaborate frameworks. Just: do what needs doing. Water plants. Prepare tea. Sweep floor. Notice when mind wanders. Return gently.

For the first six months, Kenji was frustrated beyond measure. This isn't teaching! he'd complained. Wei's response: "Exactly. Now you can begin learning."

The koan took months to understand. Teaching implies knowledge transfer—information moving from expert to student. Wei doesn't teach that way. She creates space for people to discover their own truth. Reflects what they already know but can't see. The garden is laboratory. Daily maintenance is curriculum.

Month seven he'd had breakthrough. Not dramatic—no lightning bolt of enlightenment. Just: watering plants one morning and realizing he wasn't thinking about watering plants. Wasn't analyzing whether this was presence practice or real work or meaningful activity. Just: watering. Twenty-three seconds of pure presence. Then his mind returned—*That was it! I did it!*—and presence dissolved. But those twenty-three seconds proved something. The gap between understanding presence and being present wasn't infinite. Just: very wide. Requiring practice.

So he practiced. Month eight, nine, ten. Living in Zara's guest room. Tending Wei's garden daily. Joining Zara's family for meals. Slowly learning what he'd traveled six years to learn: stop seeking and start being here.

The irony wasn't lost on him. Six years seeking teachers who would give him answers. Finally found teacher who gave him nothing. And nothing was everything.

"Breakfast," Wei says. "Then we have visitors."

"Visitors?"

"Always visitors. People seeking wisdom. I'm old. Old people are supposed to be wise. Usually disappointing."

Kenji helps Wei inside—pushing the wheelchair carefully, aware how frail her body has become. She's lost weight since he arrived. Moves slower. Sleeps more. Natural death approaching. Maybe Year 11, doctors say. Maybe sooner. The asteroid won't take her. Age will.

He prepares breakfast. Another practice—simple meal, simple actions. Rice porridge. Pickled vegetables. Tea. Wei taught him: cooking is meditation. Each movement complete in itself. Stirring rice isn't practice for enlightenment. It's just: stirring rice. Perfectly.

They eat on the balcony. Lagos District fully awake now. The distant hum of transit systems. Voices rising from compounds below. Human activity continuing despite guaranteed ending. The persistence is remarkable. Or just: what life does. Continue until it can't.

"You miss Antarctica," Wei observes.

Not question. Statement. She's right. Kenji misses his mother—they write weekly, but letters aren't presence. Misses the cold. Misses home in ways he didn't when he was seeking escape from it.

"I think about going back," he admits.

"You will. Eventually. But not yet. You're not finished here."

"Finished what?"

"Learning nothing." Wei smiles. "Still so much nothing left to learn."

---

The visitors arrive mid-morning.

Kenji is sweeping the balcony—another practice, another meditation—when he hears voices. Wei wheels herself to the doorway. Three people enter: two young seekers he recognizes from previous visits, and a woman he doesn't know. Mid-thirties, carrying a small child. Her face carries the specific desperation Kenji remembers from his own seeking years. The look that says: *Please have answers. Please fix this. Please make it bearable.*

"Professor Wei," the woman begins, voice tight. "Thank you for seeing me. I'm Adaeze. This is my daughter, Chioma. She's six years old."

Wei nods, gestures to the garden bench. "Sit. My student will make tea."

Kenji moves to the kitchen. Through the doorway he hears the woman's story—same story with different details: Daughter will die at twenty-one, never have full adult life. Mother is terrified. Seeking wisdom, comfort, anything. How do I watch my child grow knowing she'll never finish growing?

The question lands in Kenji's chest like remembered pain. Same question the Tokyo mother asked Wei about her son. Same question every parent in Year 9 carries. The asteroid doesn't discriminate. Children die young.

He prepares tea carefully. Wei's method—attention to temperature, timing, pouring. The ritual creates space. Gives people time to breathe before facing their own questions directly.

When he returns to the balcony, Wei is speaking quietly with Adaeze. The other two seekers have joined Zara, who's arrived with Maya and Kofi—daily garden visit, part of the rhythm. Maya is eleven years and six months now, brilliant and serious, absorbing everything. Kofi is eight and eight months, all energy and questions.

Kenji sets the tea tray beside Wei. Intends to return inside, give them privacy. But Wei catches his eye. "Stay. Sit with us."

He sits on the bench opposite Adaeze and Chioma. The child is playing with a toy, oblivious. The mother's hands shake as she lifts the tea cup.

"How do I do it?" Adaeze asks quietly. "How do I love her knowing I'll lose her? How do I parent her toward a future that won't exist? How do I—" Her voice breaks. "How do I not spend every moment terrified?"

Wei is silent. Not avoiding the question. Creating space for it to sit. Kenji has watched this technique dozens of times now. Silence as teaching. Let the question breathe before attempting answer.

But Wei doesn't answer. She shifts in her wheelchair, turns to Kenji. "You respond."

Kenji startles. "Me?"

"Yes. You were seeker once. Long seeking. You remember questions like hers. Speak from that."

Panic rises. He's not qualified. He's student, not teacher. He doesn't have answers—still barely has presence. But Adaeze is looking at him with desperate hope and Wei is watching with calm expectation and the words come before he decides to speak them:

"You don't watch her grow toward death," Kenji hears himself say. "You witness her grow, period. Every moment complete in itself."

Adaeze blinks. "What?"

Kenji continues, surprising himself with certainty he doesn't intellectually possess: "Your daughter has fifteen years. Not enough. But also—not nothing. If you're present for those fifteen years, really present, you'll know her fully. Not the adult she might have been. But the person she is. Completely. That matters more than duration."

"But she'll never—"

"She'll never be twenty-two. Never be thirty. Never be old. True. Also true: she's six now. Alive. Here. Real. That's not less valuable because it's temporary. It's more precious."

The words are Wei's teaching, filtered through his own seeking, emerging as something new. Not expertise. Not wisdom earned through years of practice. Just: presence speaking to presence. One human to another. Both facing the same unbearable truth. Both trying to be here anyway.

Adaeze is crying. "I'm so afraid."

"I know. I spent six years terrified. Traveled the world seeking answers about mortality. Found none. But I found this—" Kenji gestures to the garden, to Wei, to the morning itself. "Presence isn't solution. It's practice. Being here completely. Loving completely. Witnessing completely."

"It doesn't fix anything."

"No. Nothing fixes this. The asteroid still comes. Your daughter still dies young. But you can be present to her life instead of absent to her death. That's all anyone can do. Ever. It's not enough. It's also everything."

Silence. Adaeze holds her daughter closer. Chioma squirms, wants down. Adaeze releases her. The child runs to the garden, attracted by butterflies. Six years old. Fifteen years remaining. Brief and complete.

"Thank you," Adaeze says quietly. Not healed. Not fixed. But: seen. Heard. Given permission to grieve and love simultaneously. She stands. "I should—we should go. Thank you, Professor Wei. Thank you—I'm sorry, I don't know your name."

"Kenji."

"Thank you, Kenji."

They leave. Adaeze and Chioma descending the stairs. The two young seekers following. The balcony quiet except for Zara's children playing in the garden and Wei sitting in her wheelchair watching Kenji with expression he can't read.

"You watched," Kenji says. "How long?"

"The whole time." Wei's voice is soft. "You're ready."

"For what?"

"To teach. Not to replace me. To become yourself as teacher."

Kenji feels something between terror and relief. "I'm not qualified."

"Perfect. You just taught from not-knowing. That's real teaching." Wei leans forward slightly. "Qualified teachers offer answers. Unqualified teachers offer presence. You offered presence. Met her where she was. Reflected truth she already knew but couldn't see. That's teaching."

"I don't know if—"

"Of course you don't know. No one ever knows. But you're willing. You're present. You respond honestly from your own practice. That's enough."

Maya has been listening from the garden. She looks up. "Uncle Kenji is going to teach?"

Wei smiles. "Yes. When I'm too old. When I'm dead. He'll continue the practice."

"Will you teach me?" Maya asks Kenji directly. "Officially? Like Wei teaches you?"

Kenji looks at his young cousin. Eleven years old. Brilliant. Six years until she dies. Wanting to learn everything she can in the time remaining. How can he say no?

"If Wei thinks I'm ready."

"Wei knows you're ready," Wei says. "Picture Five."

The ox-herding pictures. Kenji has carried them since Tokyo—seven years ago now, Year 2, Month 11. Roshi teaching the ten stages. Picture One: seeking the ox. Picture Two: finding traces. Picture Three: glimpsing. Picture Four: catching the ox—struggle and resistance. Picture Five: taming the ox. Still effort required, but cooperation emerging. Practice working. Integration beginning.

"I'm not—" Kenji starts to protest, but Wei interrupts.

"You've caught the ox. Been holding the rope since you arrived here Month 8. Thirteen months of effort. Thirteen months of practice working. Not enlightened. But: integrated enough to teach. Picture Five is where teaching can begin. You're there."

Kenji sits with this. Thirteen months of daily practice. Watering plants. Making tea. Being present to his own failure to be present. Returning again and again. This morning, teaching that mother from something deeper than intellect. Presence responding to presence.

Maybe Wei is right. Maybe he's ready. Not because he has answers. Because he's learned to be here without needing answers. That might be teachable. That might be worth sharing.

"Okay," he says. "When you're gone, I'll continue."

"Good. But not just when I'm gone. Now. Starting now. Come to the garden with me. We teach together."

---

That evening, Wei invites combined family for dinner.

Zara's whole household arrives—Kwame, Maya, Kofi. Amara and David are visiting from Antarctica, staying two weeks. Seven people crowded around Wei's small table. More people than the apartment comfortably holds. Perfect.

Kenji helps prepare food. Simple meal—vegetables from the garden, rice, tea. The domesticity is grounding. Chopping, stirring, serving. Actions complete in themselves.

During dinner, conversation flows. Zara tells stories about compound improvements. David describes solar array maintenance. Amara shares asteroid trajectory updates—unchanged, perfect, final. Kwame talks about his work coordinating Lagos food distribution. The children compete for attention, showing off knowledge.

But Kenji watches differently now. He's not just participating. He's watching Wei AS teacher watching her. Understanding how she creates this space. How she asks questions that open instead of close. How she listens completely. How her presence allows everyone to be themselves fully.

This is teaching. Not lecturing. Not instructing. Creating space for people to discover their own truth. Facilitating instead of directing. Reflecting instead of imposing.

He sees the technique clearly now. When Maya describes her physics studies, Wei asks: "What fascinates you most?" Not "What did you learn?" but what creates fascination. Drawing out the alive part. The present part.

When Kofi bounces around asking questions—"Why is the sky blue? Why do plants grow? Why do we die?"—Wei doesn't give simplified answers. She asks back: "What do you notice about the sky?" Making the child's own observation the teaching.

When Amara discusses her work, numbers and precision, Wei comments: "You love the mathematics. The elegance. That's beautiful." Naming the love. Validating presence to the work regardless of outcome.

This is what Kenji needs to learn. Not meditation technique. Not philosophical frameworks. How to create space for others to be fully themselves. How to witness without fixing. How to teach by being present.

After dinner, children playing, adults lingering over tea, Wei catches Kenji's eye. Nods toward the balcony. He helps her wheel outside.

The evening is warm and dark. Lagos District lit up below them. Five million people living Year 9, Month 9. Less than six years left. Still living. Still gathering. Still choosing presence over despair. Or presence alongside despair. Both.

"Next year I'm too old for teaching," Wei says without preamble. "Maybe dead. You should continue."

It's not the first time she's mentioned this. But the first time Kenji doesn't immediately refuse.

"You really think I'm ready?"

"No one's ever ready. But you're willing. You're present. You respond honestly from your own not-knowing. That's enough." Wei looks at him. "What will you teach?"

Kenji considers. "I don't have answers about how to face mortality. I spent six years seeking them. Found none."

"Good. What else?"

"I have practice. Presence. Being here. Noticing when I'm not here. Returning gently."

"Yes. What else?"

"Community. People practicing together. Facing this together. Not alone."

"Yes. That's enough. That's everything." Wei is quiet for moment. "You came to Lagos seeking. What did you find?"

"Nothing." Kenji smiles. "Everything. Same thing, maybe."

"Yes. You sought answers. Found questions. Better trade. Answers end seeking. Questions continue practice. You'll teach questions."

"How?"

"By not-knowing publicly. By being honest about your own practice. By saying: I don't have solutions. But we can be present together. Learn together. Face this together. That invitation is teaching."

Kenji looks at the garden. The lemon tree standing patient. The gardenias blooming and fading. The mint spreading aggressively. Everything temporary. Everything here now. Everything worth tending.

He came to Lagos thirteen months ago exhausted, seeking his last teacher. Found Wei. Learned nothing and everything. Watered plants and made tea and swept floors and slowly, incrementally, learned presence. Not achieved. Practiced. Still practicing. Always practicing until practice ends.

Today he taught for the first time. Responded to a terrified mother from his own presence, not his intellect. Met her where she was. Offered no solutions. Just: witness. Companionship. Permission to feel everything while being here anyway.

Maybe that's what he should share. Not as expert. As fellow practitioner. Someone who spent six years seeking, found nothing permanent, learned something temporary. Someone who's still on Picture Five—still taming the ox, still working with resistance, still far from enlightenment but: practicing. Present. Willing.

"I'll teach," Kenji says. "When you're gone. Before you're gone. However long there is."

"Good." Wei smiles. "Tomorrow we'll start. Come to garden. Others are coming. You'll teach with me. Not lead—co-practice. Everyone teaching everyone. That's real sangha."

"What if I fail?"

"You will fail. Constantly. Practice isn't perfection. It's returning after failure. Teach that. Your failures are useful. Make you honest teacher."

They sit in the evening warmth. Below, Lagos continues. Above, stars invisible through city light pollution. The asteroid out there somewhere, approaching on perfect trajectory. Six years. Then: nothing.

But right now: this balcony. This garden. This teaching. This moment. Complete in itself. Temporary and eternal. Brief and infinite.

Kenji came seeking answers about how to live fifteen years knowing everyone dies. Spent six years traveling. Tokyo's Buddhism. Cairo's Stoicism. Mumbai's meditation. Lagos's presence. Each city a glimpse. Each teaching a trace. Each teacher pointing toward same simple truth: be here now. That's all. That's everything.

He finally understands. The ox-herding pictures map the journey from seeking to being. Picture One: lost and seeking desperately. Picture Two: finding intellectual traces. Picture Three: glimpsing but not holding. Picture Four: catching and struggling. Picture Five: taming—still effort, but cooperation emerging. Practice working. Integration beginning.

He's on Picture Five. Thirteen months of daily practice. Still struggling sometimes. Still catching himself absent and returning. But: the ox is tamed enough to teach from. Not because he's enlightened. Because he's willing to practice publicly. Willing to say: I don't know, but let's be here together. Let's practice together. Let's face this together.

That might be enough. That might be everything. That might be what's needed for Year 9, Month 9, with less than six years remaining.

"Thank you," Kenji says quietly. "For teaching me nothing."

"You're welcome. Thank you for learning it."

They return inside. Family still gathered. Amara discussing trajectory calculations with Maya—aunt teaching niece the mathematics of their ending. David showing Kofi how to identify different mints by smell. Zara and Kwame cleaning dishes together, easy partnership of fifteen years. Everyone present. Everyone here. Everyone practicing without knowing they're practicing.

This is Picture Ten, Kenji thinks. The final ox-herding image: Laughing Buddha entering marketplace with gift-bestowing hands. Enlightened teacher returning to ordinary world. Teaching naturally. Helping others wake. The journey completing by returning to beginning—but transformed.

Wei is Picture Ten. Has been for years. Teaching through presence. Creating space through being. Transforming everyone she touches by witnessing them completely.

Kenji is Picture Five. Still working. Still practicing. Still far from enlightenment. But: ready to enter the marketplace. Ready to offer gifts—not wisdom gifts, presence gifts. Not solutions. Companionship. Not answers. Questions. Not expertise. Honest struggle made visible.

Maybe that's enough. Maybe honest practice is better teaching than achieved enlightenment. Maybe Picture Five teacher can help Picture One students better than Picture Ten master. Because Picture Five remembers struggling. Remembers seeking. Remembers the gap between understanding and being.

He'll teach from that gap. From that honest not-knowing. From that daily practice of returning. From that choice to be present despite everything. From that fragile, necessary hope that presence matters even when nothing lasts.

Six years until everyone dies. But today: this family. This meal. This teaching. This practice. This moment. Complete. Temporary. Real.

Perfect.

---

Later, after everyone has left, after Wei is in bed, after the compound quiets, Kenji sits in the guest room writing to his mother. Nine years of letters between them. She's kept every one. He's kept all of hers.

*Mom,*

*Year 9, Month 9 from Lagos. Thirteen months with Professor Wei now. Living in Zara's guest room. Practicing daily. Still not enlightened. Still struggling. But: something shifted today.*

*A woman came seeking wisdom about watching her daughter die young. Wei told me to respond. I did. Spoke from presence, not knowledge. Said things I didn't know I knew until I heard myself saying them. Afterward, Wei told me I'm ready to teach.*

*I don't feel ready. But she explained: ready doesn't mean qualified. Ready means willing to practice publicly. Willing to teach from not-knowing. Willing to say: I don't have answers, but we can be present together.*

*That might be what I learned in six years of seeking. Not how to achieve enlightenment. How to practice being here. How to return when I'm absent. How to witness without fixing. How to be present to what is instead of what should be.*

*The ox-herding pictures call this Picture Five—taming the ox. Still effort required. Still struggling. But: cooperation emerging. Practice working. Integration beginning. Wei says that's enough to teach from. Not as master. As fellow practitioner further along the path.*

*I'm coming home eventually. Not yet. Wei needs help teaching. The Lagos community needs presence practice. Maya wants to learn formally—she's brilliant, Mom. Eleven years old and understands impermanence intellectually. Wants emotional integration. I think I can help her. Not because I've achieved it. Because I'm working on it. Honest struggle as teaching.*

*Six years left. I won't spend them all here. But: some time. Continuing what Wei started. Teaching what I learned. Passing it forward.*

*Thank you for letting me seek. Thank you for writing every week despite my wandering. Thank you for governing with dignity while I was traveling looking for what you already embodied. I see it now. Your daily briefings. Your witness work. Your showing up. That's Picture Nine—you've been home this whole time.*

*I'm on Picture Five. Still far from home. But: headed in the right direction. Not seeking anymore. Practicing. Teaching. Being here.*

*That's enough. That's everything.*

*Love you. See you eventually.*

*Your teaching son,*  
*Kenji*

He seals the letter. Tomorrow he'll send it. Tomorrow he'll meet Wei in the garden at dawn. Tomorrow he'll water plants and practice presence and co-teach with her. The first official teaching session. Beginning the work that will continue until Wei dies, until Kenji returns to Antarctica, until the asteroid ends everything.

But right now: this quiet room. This letter written. This practice chosen. This moment complete.

The lemon tree will need water tomorrow. The gardenias will need tending. The mint will need cutting back. The teaching will continue. The practice will persist. The presence will matter.

Not because it saves anyone. Because it's what's happening. Because being here is what's possible. Because showing up is enough.

Kenji sleeps. Dreams of gardens and teaching and his mother's morning briefings. Dreams of the ox-herding pictures—Picture Five transforming slowly toward Picture Six. Dreams of the marketplace where he'll enter eventually, carrying gifts he doesn't know he has, helping people he hasn't met yet, teaching what he barely understands.

Dreams of practice continuing. Presence persisting. Being here completely until here ends.

That's all anyone can do. That's all anyone has ever done. That's everything.

The flower blooms. The flower fades. The practice continues.

Home.
