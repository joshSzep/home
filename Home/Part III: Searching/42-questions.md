# Chapter 42: Questions

**Maya Okafor-Mensah | Year 13, Month 9 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia petals had fallen overnight.

Maya sat on Wei's bench—*the* bench, though calling it hers felt presumptuous even two years after death—and studied the brown petals scattered on soil below. Yesterday they'd been white, perfect, fragrant. This morning: composting. Three days of blooming, then transformation. Wei would have said something about this. Would have made it teaching. But Wei wasn't here to say anything.

Fifteen years, nine months old. Twenty-two months until she died. Maya calculated it automatically now, the way some people counted heartbeats. Six hundred and seventy days. 16,080 hours. Each one ticking down toward seventeen years, seven months. Toward the moment when consciousness ended and her brief life became past tense.

The garden looked the same as it had when Wei tended it. Ling and the compound volunteers maintained everything perfectly. The lemon tree fruiting. The mint spreading. The gardenias blooming their three-day cycles. All continuing. All temporary. All here despite Wei's absence.

Maya had been practicing presence for twenty-three months now. Since one week after Wei died. Year 11, Month 9 to Year 13, Month 9. Almost two years of daily meditation. Weekly teachings with Uncle Kenji. Reading Buddhist texts until the words blurred together. Understanding intellectually. But emotionally?

She was more confused than ever.

That was the problem. The practice was supposed to help. Supposed to make facing death clearer, easier, more bearable. Instead, the questions multiplied. The doubts deepened. The fear sharpened into precision instruments that cut deeper the more present she became.

Maya pressed her palms against the bench. Solid wood. Real texture. Present-moment awareness—she could do that. Notice the bench. Notice breath. Notice the morning heat building in Lagos District's engineered climate. Notice, notice, notice. But what did noticing accomplish when what she noticed was: I'm going to die at seventeen and I'm terrified and no amount of breath-counting changes that.

She'd come to the garden before dawn. Needed to sit before Kenji's teaching session this morning. Needed to be alone with the confusion. Needed to figure out if she was practicing presence or wasting the time she had left.

The calculation came again: twenty-two months. If she spent an hour each day meditating, that was six hundred and sixty hours total. Twenty-seven and a half days of her remaining life spent sitting still, watching breath, being present to... what? The inexorable approach of her own ending?

Maybe she should be out there. Doing teenager things. Whatever those were. The other fifteen-year-olds in the compound—the ones she'd grown up with—they were living differently. Mira and Talib and Chinwe and the others. They gathered in Unit 23 most evenings. Music playing. Dancing, kissing, laughing desperately. Living like the world was ending because the world was ending.

Maya had stopped going months ago. Couldn't bear it. The forced joy. The frantic energy. The way they pretended presence by being loud. Or maybe they weren't pretending. Maybe they'd found something real she couldn't access. Maybe meditation had cut her off from the simple human response: when time is short, feel everything intensely.

But she was meditating about feeling everything. Wasn't that the same thing?

No. It wasn't the same. She knew that. But she couldn't articulate why.

The sun climbed. Morning light shifting through leaves. Maya watched it happen—the way shadows moved, the way colors changed. Presence practice. Being here. But the question underneath persisted: *What's the point?*

Wei never promised the practice would make death okay. Kenji never promised enlightenment. But they implied—didn't they?—that presence mattered. That being awake to your life was worth more than being asleep to it. Maya believed that intellectually. Emotionally: she was fifteen and a half, and dying young, and sitting still felt like surrender.

Footsteps on the stairs. Maya didn't turn. Knew that tread. Uncle Kenji, arriving early for the teaching session. He probably saw her from the building. Probably guessed she needed to talk.

"Good morning, Maya." His voice was quiet, respectful.

"Morning."

"You're here early."

"Couldn't sleep."

Kenji settled on the other end of the bench. Not too close. Giving space. He'd learned that from Wei—how to be present without crowding.

They sat in silence for a moment. Maya appreciated that he didn't immediately ask what was wrong. Didn't try to fix anything. Just: sat.

Finally Maya spoke. "Uncle Kenji, I need to ask something."

"Okay."

"The practice—it's supposed to help, right? Make facing death easier?"

Kenji was quiet for a breath. "It makes life clearer. Death remains hard."

"But I don't feel clearer." Maya's voice came out sharper than intended. "I feel... more confused. More aware of how much I'm losing. Like the practice is making everything worse."

She expected platitudes. Expected reassurance. Expected *something* to make the confusion manageable. Instead, Kenji surprised her.

"That's progress."

Maya turned to stare at him. "What?"

"You're seeing clearly. Before, death was abstract. Seventeen years, seven months—just numbers. Now: real. That's harder. But also: honest. You're not bypassing grief with philosophy. You're feeling it."

The words landed wrong. Maya felt heat rising in her chest. "So the practice is *supposed* to make me feel worse? That's the goal?"

"The practice doesn't have a goal. That's the problem with how you're approaching it." Kenji's voice was patient but direct. "You're practicing *at* death. Trying to master it. Trying to achieve some state where dying at seventeen feels okay. That's not possible. Won't ever be possible."

"Then what's the point?"

"Being present to what is. Right now, what is: confusion, fear, grief, anger. Being present to *that* is practice. Not being present to some peaceful acceptance you haven't reached yet."

Maya pulled her knees to her chest. Made herself smaller. "You're saying I'm doing it wrong."

"I'm saying you're expecting certainty. The practice doesn't give certainty. Gives presence. Those aren't the same thing."

They sat again. Maya's mind spinning through the words, trying to find the flaw in his logic. Couldn't. That made it worse somehow. If Kenji was right—if presence was just being here with confusion, not resolving it—then what was she practicing *for*?

"Will it help?" Maya asked quietly. "When the moment comes? When the asteroid hits? Will all this practicing make that moment bearable?"

"I don't know."

The honesty was brutal. Maya had wanted reassurance. Wanted him to say: *Yes, Maya, the practice will carry you through. You're building capacity. You'll be okay.* Instead: *I don't know.*

"Then why practice?" Her voice broke slightly.

"Because being present to your life—even the terrifying parts—is better than being numb to it. Because twenty-two months of awareness is worth more than twenty-two months of distraction. Because—" Kenji paused. "Because you chose this. You asked to learn. You're learning. The confusion *is* the learning."

"I don't want confusion. I want answers."

"I know. Everyone does. But answers don't exist for this. Only presence does. Only being here, fully here, until here ends."

Maya put her face against her knees. Felt tears threatening. Sixteen more people would arrive in thirty minutes for the teaching session. She couldn't cry in front of them. Couldn't be the teenager who couldn't handle what everyone was facing.

"I'm alone," she whispered. "Everyone my age is out there living. I'm in here meditating. And I don't know if I'm choosing wisdom or missing my life."

Kenji's hand briefly touched her shoulder. Light contact. There and gone. "You're not alone. I'm here. Your mother's here. Kofi's here. Everyone at these sessions—we're all practicing together. Facing this together."

"But you're adults. You've had time. I'm fifteen. I should be—I don't know—falling in love, doing stupid teenager things, *living*. Instead I'm sitting on this bench every morning watching my breath and calculating how many days I have left."

"Presence *is* living."

"Is it?" Maya lifted her head. Looked at Kenji directly. "How do you know? How do you know that meditating is living rather than avoiding life? Because sometimes it feels like I'm just... sitting still while everything passes by."

Kenji met her eyes. "I don't know. I struggled with the same question. Six years seeking, trying to figure out how to live fifteen years. Wei taught me: practice isn't preparation for living. Practice is living. But that's my answer. You have to find yours."

"What if my answer is different? What if presence practice isn't right for me?"

"Then you stop practicing. Do something else. Whatever feels real to you. No one's forcing you to sit. Not me. Not Wei's memory. Not your mother. This is your choice."

The freedom in that statement felt dangerous. Maya had built her entire identity for two years around being a practitioner. Wei's teaching passing to her through Mama, through Kenji. If she stopped now, who was she?

"I don't want to stop," she admitted. "I just want it to make sense. Want it to feel like progress instead of... this."

"What's this?"

"Doubt. Confusion. Questions multiplying instead of dissolving. I thought practice would give me peace. Instead I have more questions now than when I started."

"Good questions or bad questions?"

Maya considered. "Real questions. Honest questions. Questions I can't avoid anymore."

"Then you're exactly where you should be." Kenji smiled slightly. "Picture Two of the ox-herding pictures: finding traces. You're seeing evidence of the ox everywhere—in your confusion, your doubt, your questions. That's closer than seeking something you haven't found yet."

"I don't want traces. I want the whole ox."

"You're fifteen. Give yourself time."

"I don't have time!" The words burst out. "Twenty-two months! That's all! I don't have years to slowly progress through Buddhist teaching pictures. I have twenty-two months to figure this out or I die terrified and confused!"

Kenji absorbed the outburst without flinching. "You're right. You don't have time. None of us do. But grasping doesn't speed anything up. Just makes the grasping tighter."

"So I should just accept confusion?"

"You should be present to it. Which you are. Right now. Sitting here, feeling it, questioning it. That's practice. Not pleasant. But: practice."

Maya slumped back against the bench. Exhausted. These conversations with Kenji always left her more tired than before. Not because they were unhelpful. Because they were *too* helpful. Because he saw clearly and said honestly and never offered the easy comfort she craved.

Aunt Amara and Uncle David would arrive in a few weeks—permanently, finally. Moving to Lagos to be with family for the end. Part of Maya had hoped their arrival would somehow make the questions easier. Make practice clearer. But sitting here with Kenji, she realized: nothing external would resolve the internal confusion. Not family convergence. Not more time. Not certainty that would never come.

People were arriving. Voices from the stairs. The teaching circle gathering. Maya straightened, wiped her face. Needed to compose herself. Be the serious practitioner everyone expected.

"Stay after?" Kenji asked.

"Okay."

He stood, moved toward the gathering group. Maya remained on the bench a moment longer. The gardenia petals still scattered. The lemon tree still fruiting. The morning still arriving despite everything. Presence to impermanence. That was the teaching. She understood it. Just couldn't *feel* it the way Wei seemed to feel it.

---

The teaching session was meditation. Thirty minutes of sitting. Maya positioned herself in back, her usual spot. Closed her eyes. Returned to breath.

One. Breath in.

Two. Breath out.

Three. Mind wandering—*What if I'm wasting my time?*

Notice. Return.

Four. Breath in.

Five. Breath out.

Six. Mind wandering—*Mira and the others are probably sleeping now, stayed up late, actually living—*

Notice. Return.

The meditation wasn't peaceful. Wasn't calm. Was just: returning over and over to breath while her mind spiraled through every doubt. This was practice? This chaos?

Seven. Breath in.

Eight. Breath out.

Kenji's voice, soft: "If your mind wanders a thousand times, return a thousand times. That's not failure. That's practice."

Easy for him to say. His mind probably stayed calm. Probably achieved the deep stillness Wei described. Maya's mind was a riot. A protest. A desperate grasping at certainty that kept slipping away.

Nine. Breath in.

Ten. Breath out.

The thirty minutes felt like hours. When Kenji finally rang the bell, Maya opened her eyes feeling: nothing resolved. Nothing accomplished. Just: thirty minutes older. Twenty-two months minus thirty minutes now. Time passing. Life passing. Practice not saving anything.

The group talked after. Someone asked about acceptance. Someone else about facing family members who weren't practicing. Ibrahim—the quiet maintenance worker who came every session—shared something about learning presence through physical work, through maintaining arrays, through body rather than mind.

Maya barely listened. Too lost in her own spiral. Too aware of the questions proliferating instead of simplifying.

When people departed, Maya remained. Kenji helping clean up—collecting cushions, straightening the space. His movements had that quality Wei taught: complete attention to simple tasks. Maya used to find that inspiring. Today it felt performative.

"You stayed," Kenji said.

"You asked me to."

"But you chose to. Thank you." He settled back on the bench beside her. "Want to tell me what's really troubling you?"

"I already told you. Confusion. Doubt. Questions."

"Those are symptoms. What's underneath?"

Maya was quiet for a long moment. Trying to find the actual truth beneath all the words. When she spoke, her voice was barely audible.

"I'm scared I'm wasting the time I have left. That presence practice is just... spiritual bypassing. A way to avoid feeling the horror by calling it enlightenment."

There. The real fear. The one she couldn't voice during the teaching session. The one that kept her awake at night.

Kenji absorbed this. "Do you feel like you're avoiding the horror?"

"No. I feel the horror constantly. That's the problem. Practice doesn't make it go away. Doesn't even make it manageable. Just makes me more aware of exactly how horrifying it is."

"Then you're not bypassing."

"But maybe I should be. Maybe I should be out there with Mira and the others, numbing myself, feeling everything desperately instead of sitting here watching breath."

"Is that what you want?"

Maya turned to look at him. "I don't know what I want. That's the problem. I don't know if presence practice at fifteen is wisdom or waste. Don't know if I'll regret this choice. Don't know anything."

"The not-knowing is hard."

"It's unbearable."

"But you're bearing it. That's courage."

Maya laughed bitterly. "Doesn't feel like courage. Feels like I'm failing at the one thing I chose to do."

"You're not failing. You're questioning. That's different. Questioning *is* practice. Maybe the most important practice—being present to doubt without needing to resolve it immediately."

"I need to resolve it though. Need to know I'm choosing right. Because if I'm not—if presence practice is the wrong path for me—I'm losing months I can't get back."

"You can stop any time. Try something else. See if it fits better."

The offer was genuine. Maya knew that. Kenji wasn't trying to convince her. Wasn't attached to her continuing. But that freedom made the choice harder, not easier.

"I don't want to stop," she said again. "Want it to work the way it's supposed to."

"How is it supposed to work?"

"I don't know. Make me peaceful? Make dying okay? Give me certainty that this matters?"

"None of those are possible. Not for anyone. Not even Wei after seventy years of practice. She died ready but not peaceful. Accepting but not okay. Present but not certain it meant anything beyond being present."

Maya felt something crack in her chest. Not breaking. Cracking open. "So this is it? This confusion? This doubt? This is what practice offers?"

"Yes. And also: being here. Really here. Awake to your life. Feeling it—all of it. The beauty and the horror together. That's what presence is. Not peace. Not certainty. Just: aliveness."

"I want more than that."

"Everyone does. But more than that doesn't exist. Only this exists. This moment. This bench. This conversation. This doubt. All temporary. All precious. All real."

Maya put her face in her hands. Not crying. Just: overwhelmed. The practice was working exactly as intended and she hated it. Because it didn't give her what she wanted—couldn't give her what she wanted. Could only give her this: presence to what is, including the presence to not wanting what is.

"I need to go," she said. "Papa's probably worried."

"Okay." Kenji stood. "Maya—one more thing."

She looked up at him.

"You're doing well. Better than you think. The questioning, the doubting, the struggling—that's not failure. That's growth. You're facing something most people avoid their entire lives. Facing it at fifteen. That's remarkable."

"Doesn't feel remarkable."

"It wouldn't. Growth rarely does." He smiled. "Keep practicing. Or don't. Whatever you choose: be present to the choosing. That's enough."

Maya nodded. Not comforted. But: heard. Seen. Witnessed in her confusion by someone who'd lived his own version of it.

She stood, gathered her things. Walked down the stairs from Wei's garden. The compound was waking fully now—voices, movement, life continuing. Twenty-two months of this left. Six hundred and seventy days. 16,080 hours.

Maybe she'd spend them practicing presence. Maybe she'd try something else. Maybe she'd keep questioning whether she was choosing right. Maybe that was the practice: living the questions rather than demanding answers.

Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.

Everything uncertain. Everything temporary. Everything here now.

Later that week, Maya had her routine checkup with Dr. Tanaka.

The doctor's office was in the compound medical center—three rooms that used to serve two hundred people, now serving the sixty who remained. Dr. Tanaka had been Maya's pediatrician since birth. Nearly sixteen years of checkups. Growth charts that now mapped toward nothing. Development milestones that ended at seventeen.

"How are you feeling?" Dr. Tanaka asked, running the scanner over Maya's vitals.

"Fine. Physically."

"And non-physically?"

Maya looked at her. Dr. Tanaka was forty-nine now—trained in Tokyo when that specialty still made sense, specialized in child development when development still had futures. Now she attended Wei's teachings. Practiced presence medicine. Witnessed children's complete lives instead of measuring progress toward adulthood.

"Confused," Maya admitted. "About practice. About everything."

Dr. Tanaka nodded slowly. Finished the scan. "You seem different. Older, maybe. Or just... more present."

"Is that good?"

"I don't know. You tell me."

Maya considered. "I'm practicing meditation. Trying to face what's coming. But I'm more confused than before I started. Is that—is that normal?"

Dr. Tanaka smiled slightly. "I attend the teachings too. Started two years ago. I'm *still* more confused than when I began. Confusion is honest. Better than false certainty."

"You're a doctor. Don't you need certainty?"

"I used to think so. Now I realize: I was certain about things that weren't certain. Children growing to adulthood. Careers. Futures. All illusions. The confusion I feel now is clearer than the certainty I felt then."

Maya absorbed this. Her doctor—the professional, the expert—admitting confusion. Saying it was progress rather than failure.

"How's it going?" Dr. Tanaka asked. "The practice?"

"It's hard. I'm more confused than before."

"Good. Confusion is honest. Keep practicing."

The validation landed differently coming from Dr. Tanaka than from Kenji. Kenji was a teacher—he was supposed to encourage practice. Dr. Tanaka was a medical professional, trained in empiricism and evidence. If she said confusion was progress, maybe it actually was.

"Do you think it matters?" Maya asked. "Presence practice? Do you think it will help when—when the moment comes?"

Dr. Tanaka set down the scanner. Looked at Maya directly. "I don't know. I hope so. But I practice anyway because being present to my patients' lives—really present, not just clinically observing—that matters now. Today. Regardless of whether it helps in twenty-two months."

"But what if we're wrong? What if presence practice is just... a way to feel better about something unbearable? Spiritual bypassing?"

"Are you feeling better?"

Maya laughed despite herself. "No. I feel worse. More aware of everything I'm losing."

"Then you're not bypassing. You're facing it. That's different." Dr. Tanaka pulled up the growth chart on her display. "You're fifteen years, nine months old. One hundred and sixty-two centimeters tall. Fifty-one kilograms. Development: normal for age. In twenty-two months, you'll be seventeen years, seven months. Maybe one hundred and sixty-five centimeters. Maybe fifty-four kilograms. Then: nothing."

The clinical precision was brutal. Maya appreciated it. Dr. Tanaka wasn't hiding behind kindness.

"I chart this knowing it's meaningless," Dr. Tanaka continued. "Growth toward nothing. Development ending mid-trajectory. My entire specialty: absurd. But I chart it anyway because you're here now. You're growing now. Presence to that—your actual life happening—that's what practice gives me. Maybe it's bypass. Maybe it's wisdom. I don't know. But it's better than not witnessing you."

Maya felt tears starting. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For being honest. For not pretending this is okay."

Dr. Tanaka touched Maya's hand briefly. "It's not okay. Won't ever be okay. But you're here. We're here. Being present to each other. That matters."

The checkup continued. Height, weight, blood pressure, vision. All normal. All temporary. All meticulously recorded in charts that would burn with everything else.

When Maya left the medical center, she felt: not better. Not worse. Just: seen. Witnessed in her confusion by another person learning to witness what couldn't be changed.

---

Evening found Maya in the apartment. Mama cooking dinner. Papa reviewing compound maintenance schedules. Kofi—twelve years, eleven months old—bouncing through the living room, all energy and laughter.

Maya watched her brother from the couch. He was so *present*. Not practicing formally. Not meditating. Not reading Buddhist texts. Just: living. Playing. Being exactly twelve years, eleven months old. Present without trying to be present.

Maybe that was wisdom too. Maybe all her meditation and questioning was overthinking something Kofi understood naturally: be here, be happy, be alive. Simple.

But Maya couldn't be simple anymore. Wei's death had awakened her to impermanence viscerally. Twenty-three months of practice had deepened that awareness. She couldn't unknow what she knew. Couldn't return to childhood innocence. Could only move forward through the confusion toward... what?

She didn't know. That was the unbearable part. Not knowing whether she was progressing or regressing. Not knowing whether presence practice would help or fail her. Not knowing if she was choosing wisdom or wasting time.

Kofi crashed into the couch beside her. "Maya! Come play!"

"Not right now."

"Why not?"

"Thinking."

"About what?"

Maya looked at her brother. His face open, curious, uncomplicated. He knew he'd die at fourteen. Knew the asteroid was coming. But it didn't consume him the way it consumed her. He just: lived. Day by day. Present without trying to be present.

"About practice," Maya said. "About whether it matters."

"Does it have to matter?" Kofi asked.

The question was so simple it stopped Maya's spiral. "What do you mean?"

"I don't know. You practice because you want to. That seems like enough. Like me playing. I don't play because it matters. I play because it's what I want to do."

Maya stared at her twelve-year-old brother. The wisdom of not-seeking. The clarity of natural presence. Maybe all her confusion came from demanding that practice *accomplish* something. Maybe it was enough that she'd chosen it. That she wanted it. That she did it.

Maybe meaning didn't require justification.

"You're smarter than me," Maya said.

"No I'm not. You're the smart one."

"You're the wise one then."

Kofi grinned. "Can the wise one have help with homework?"

"Math or science?"

"Both."

Maya pulled herself off the couch. Followed Kofi to the table. Mama watching them with that expression—love and grief mixed together. Pride and devastation. The look of a mother who knew exactly when her children would die.

They worked through Kofi's assignments together. Math problems that wouldn't matter. Science concepts that wouldn't become careers. Knowledge for its own sake. Transmission happening naturally: Maya teaching Kofi, not because he'd use it, but because teaching was connection. Because understanding together was presence.

Maybe that was the point. Not some distant enlightenment. Just: this. Siblings at a table. Brother asking questions. Sister explaining. Love made visible through shared attention.

Presence to what is. Nothing more. Nothing less. Just: this.

---

After dinner, Maya retreated to her room. Pulled out the journal she'd started after Wei's death. Twenty-three months of entries. Questions and doubts and breakthroughs and backslides. The full arc of a practice that wasn't linear.

She turned to a fresh page. Wrote the date: Year 13, Month 9. Wrote the calculation: 22 months remaining.

Then wrote:

*I don't know if this practice will help when the moment comes. Don't know if I'm choosing right. Don't know if presence is wisdom or waste.*

*Twenty-two months left. I'm fifteen years, nine months old. More confused than ever. More aware of loss. More terrified of dying. Practice hasn't fixed anything.*

*But today Kofi asked: does it have to matter? Maybe choosing it is enough. Maybe doing it is enough. Maybe questioning whether it matters IS the practice.*

*Kenji says confusion is progress. Dr. Tanaka says confusion is honest. Mama would say presence is living. Kofi would say just do what you want to do.*

*This is my choice. Fifteen years, nine months old. Twenty-two months left. I choose presence. Not because it's right. Not because it will save me. Not because I'm certain.*

*Because it's mine.*

Maya closed the journal. Set it aside. Lay back on her bed and stared at the ceiling.

Tomorrow she'd sit again. Watch breath again. Question everything again. The practice would continue. Not easier. Not clearer. Just: continuing.

She'd never know until the asteroid hit and consciousness ended and all the questions dissolved into nothing.

But right now—this moment—she was here. Alive. Confused but present. Terrified but practicing anyway.

Something real. Something honest. Something hers.

The flower would bloom for twenty-two more months. Then fall. But right now: blooming. Right now: here. Right now: this breath, this moment, this brief and precious and complete life happening.

Wei never promised certainty. Kenji never promised peace. They promised: presence to what is.

Right now, what is: doubt, fear, confusion, grief.

And underneath all of it: fierce, fragile, temporary aliveness.

Maya breathed. In. Out. Present to the questioning. Present to the doubt. Present to the twenty-two months remaining and the fifteen years, nine months already lived.

Not ready. Never ready. But: here.

---

Next morning, Maya returned to Wei's garden.

Predawn. Alone. The ritual continuing despite everything. Maybe because of everything.

She sat on the bench. Closed her eyes. Returned to breath.

One. In.

Two. Out.

Three. Mind wandering—*What if I'm wrong? What if this is waste?*

Notice. Return.

Four. In.

Five. Out.

The gardenia had new buds forming. Would bloom in a few days. Three days of perfection. Then: composting. The cycle continuing. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything here now.

Maya practiced. Not peacefully. Not with certainty. Just: returning. Again and again and again. The way Kenji taught. The way Wei taught. The way she was teaching herself through twenty-three months of showing up despite doubt.

Six. In.

Seven. Out.

People would arrive soon. The teaching circle would gather. Kenji would ring the bell and they'd sit together. Practicing uncertainty together. Facing the end together. Being present together to what couldn't be changed.

And Maya would be there. Not because she was sure. Not because practice had given her peace. But because this was her choice. Her path. Her practice.

Right or wrong—she didn't know. Couldn't know. Would never know until the moment arrived and consciousness either held or shattered.

But right now: this breath. This bench. This garden. This life happening. This fierce and fragile and temporary presence.

Eight. In.

Nine. Out.

The practice continued. Not easier. Just: continuing.

That was enough.

That was everything.

That was home.
