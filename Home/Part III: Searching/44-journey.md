# Chapter 44: Journey

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 15, Month 1 | Lagos District**

---

The apartment is nearly empty.

Zara stands in the kitchen where she's made breakfast for fifteen years, looking at bare walls. The children's drawings—gone, carefully rolled and packed. The engineering models—disassembled, archived. The plants—Kwame gave most away yesterday, kept only three small pots for the journey. Seventy square meters of accumulated life reduced to what fits in six bags.

What matters, it turns out, fits in very little space.

Maya emerges from her room carrying the butterfly book. Wei's gift, eleven years old now, pages soft from repeated reading. Nothing else in her hands. "I'm ready," she says.

Kofi bounces out behind her—diminished energy this morning, more subdued. He's holding the small pot with mint cuttings from Wei's garden. "Can I bring this?"

"Of course, baby." Zara takes the pot, adds it to the collection Kwame is packing. Lemon tree seedling. Gardenia cutting. Mint. Green threads connecting Lagos to Antarctica. Wei to wherever they're going.

Kwame moves through the space checking corners, closing drawers, the physical ritual of leaving. Fifteen years in this apartment. Nineteen years married. Twenty-two years together. Every surface holds memory—Maya's first steps here, Kofi's birth homecoming, ten thousand ordinary dinners, Wei's garden visible from the balcony. Home. Real home.

Temporary home.

"Last check," Kwame says quietly. His hand finds Zara's. Squeezes once. No words needed. They both know what they're losing. They both know why they're leaving.

Family. Three months together. That's everything.

---

The compound gathers at noon.

Sixty people in the courtyard—everyone who's left. Fifteen years of community reduced but not destroyed. Mr. Okonkwo stands at the center, eighty-seven years old, leaning on his cane but present. Still here. Still tending.

"Year 0," he begins without preamble. "Most fled Lagos. Smart people. We stayed. Some trapped. Some choosing. Some not knowing what else to do."

Zara has heard this before. Heard it at the Year 6 gathering, the Year 14 gathering. But today it lands differently. Today is goodbye.

"Fifteen years," Mr. Okonkwo continues. "Built something real. Not forever. Just: real. Gardens on rooftops. Water systems. Shared meals. Collective childcare. Community when community seemed impossible."

He looks directly at Zara. "This family—Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi—they taught us something. Defiance. Year 0, Month 10, Kofi was born. People called it cruel. Called it selfish. Called it wrong." His voice strengthens. "They were wrong. Kofi's existence gave us permission. Permission to live. Permission to build. Permission to plant gardens nine years before impact because gardens matter even when nothing lasts."

Adanna steps forward. Fierce as ever at forty-five, son Samuel beside her. "Thank you," she says simply. "For showing us life was worth choosing. Kofi turned fourteen three months ago. Samuel turned twenty last year. Brief lives. Complete lives. You taught us that."

Samuel speaks—rare for him. "Fourteen is enough if you're present for all fourteen years. Maya taught me that. She's seventeen now. Practices every day. Teaches others. Brief doesn't mean incomplete. Thank you for showing us."

Maya shifts beside Zara, uncomfortable with praise. But listening. Hearing that her life mattered to people beyond family. That two years, five months of practice spread outward in ways she couldn't see.

Tom approaches next. Awkward but sincere, holding a small wrapped package. "Fifteen years maintaining water because you made me believe maintenance mattered. The greywater systems we designed together—Year 6, remember?—still running. Still clean. Five more months of clean water because we cared." He hands her the package. "Schematics. Complete documentation. So whoever's left can maintain after we're gone. Work continues. Always continues."

Zara takes the package. Feels the weight of it. Fifteen years of engineering made portable. "Thank you, Tom. For everything. For showing up."

"Learned it from you."

Ling steps forward with a small box. "Professor Wei's final letters. She wrote these Year 10, knowing she wouldn't survive to see the end. One for Kenji. One for you. One for Maya when she turns seventeen." Ling's voice breaks. "She wanted you to have them. To open them Antarctica. When you need her wisdom but she's not there."

Zara takes the box. Three sealed envelopes, Wei's careful calligraphy. The weight of them enormous. Wei's voice preserved. Wei's teaching continuing. Three years, five months after death, still teaching.

Dr. Tanaka is last. She stands before Zara with professional mask completely dissolved. Just: human. "Fifteen years I've been Maya and Kofi's pediatrician. Watched them grow knowing they'd never finish growing. Every checkup measured development toward no future. My entire specialty made absurd by physics."

She looks at Maya and Kofi. "But you taught me something I couldn't learn from textbooks. Growth isn't about reaching some endpoint. It's about being fully alive in each stage. You've been fully alive every moment I've known you. Completely yourselves. Wholly present. That's enough. That's everything. Thank you for letting me witness it."

Maya is crying. Kofi is crying. Zara is crying. Kwame's arm around her shoulders, solid and warm and here.

"We leave in two hours," Zara manages. "Transport at 14:00. But—" She looks at all of them. Sixty people who chose community when isolation was easier. Who built gardens knowing they'd burn. Who loved children knowing they'd lose them. Who showed up every day for fifteen years because showing up mattered. "But you'll be with us. Everything you taught us. Everything we built together. We're carrying it. To Antarctica. To the end. You're not losing us. We're just—somewhere else. Still family. Still community. Still connected."

Mr. Okonkwo nods. "Good. Now eat. Last meal together should be real meal."

---

They eat in the courtyard. Shared food from shared gardens. Tomatoes Mr. Okonkwo grew. Herbs from the rooftop. Synth-protein Tom seasoned. Bread someone baked this morning. Simple food. Real food. Communion.

Maya sits between Zara and Kofi, quiet. She's been quiet all morning. Zara knows this silence—processing silence, feeling silence. Her daughter saying goodbye to everything she's known.

"Mama," Maya says quietly. "Can I go to the garden? One more time?"

"Of course, baby. We have time."

Maya stands. Kofi immediately follows. "I'm coming too."

They disappear toward the stairwell. Zara watches them go—her children, seventeen and fourteen, going to say goodbye to Wei's space. To the place that taught them everything that matters.

Kwame's hand finds hers again. "They're ready."

"Are they?"

"As ready as anyone can be. They practiced. They learned. They're present. That's all Wei could give them."

"It's not enough."

"No. But it's what they have."

Zara leans into him. Feels his steadiness. His quiet strength that's held her together for nineteen years. "I'm scared."

"Me too."

"Antarctica won't be like this. Won't be community like this. Will be—huge. Anonymous. Two billion strangers dying together."

"Won't be anonymous. Kenji there. Elena. Amara. David. They've built community too. Different community. But real. We'll find our people. We always find our people."

Zara knows he's right. But leaving hurts anyway. Fifteen years of roots, pulled up. Even knowing they'll burn in five months. Even knowing family matters more. Leaving still hurts.

---

Maya finds Wei's garden unchanged.

Three years, five months since Wei died. The garden keeps growing anyway. Ling maintained it Year 11-12. Then others took turns. Now: blooming. The lemon tree heavy with fruit. Gardenias opening white petals. Mint spreading everywhere, unstoppable.

Wei's bench waits. Maya sits. Kofi sits beside her.

"Last time," Kofi says.

"Last time."

They sit in silence. The compound sounds rise around them—voices, laughter, crying, life continuing despite endings. The Lagos District hum beyond—two million people still here, still living. Five months left. Everyone choosing how to spend them.

"Maya," Kofi asks. "Will Antarctica be scary?"

"Probably."

"Will we have friends there?"

"Probably. Uncle Kenji teaches there. Grandma Elena. Aunt Amara and Uncle David. We'll have family."

"But not Mr. Okonkwo. Not Adanna. Not Samuel."

"No. Not them."

Kofi touches the mint plant. Rubs a leaf between his fingers. The smell rises—sharp, clean, alive. "I'm sad."

"Me too."

"But also—" He struggles for words. "Also glad? We're going to be with Grandma Elena. I've only met her twice. And Uncle Kenji I've met like five times. I want to know them better. Before—"

"Before we die."

"Yeah."

Maya takes his hand. Her little brother. Who won't be little much longer. Who'll be dead in five months. Who right now is fourteen years, three months old and holding her hand in Wei's garden saying goodbye to everything he's known.

"I'm glad too," Maya says. "Sad and glad. Both. Wei taught me that. You can hold both feelings at once. Grief for what you're losing and gratitude for what you're moving toward. Both true. Both valid. Both present."

"I practiced last night," Kofi says. "What you taught me. Counting breaths. I got to fourteen before I lost count."

"That's good."

"Is it enough? For—when it happens?"

Maya considers. Honest answer. True answer. "I don't know. I've practiced two years, five months. I'm still terrified. But practice means I'm terrified AND present. Not hiding from it. Not pretending it's not coming. Just—with it. Feeling all of it. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's all anyone can do."

Kofi nods. Squeezes her hand. "Will you hold my hand? When the asteroid comes?"

"Yes. I promise. We'll all hold hands. Mama, Papa, you, me, Aunt Amara, Uncle David. Family. Together. I promise."

"Okay."

They sit longer. Maya memorizes everything. The lemon tree's exact shape. The gardenia blooms' specific white. The mint's sharp smell. The bench's rough wood. Wei's presence still here somehow, three years after death. Teaching continuing. Wisdom spreading. Brief life that mattered completely.

"Thank you," Maya whispers. Not sure who she's thanking. Wei. The garden. Life itself for giving her seventeen years. Incomplete years. Enough years. Both.

The garden doesn't answer. Just grows. Blooms. Lives. Does what gardens do.

That's answer enough.

---

The transport arrives at 14:00 precisely.

Private vehicle—Elena arranged it. Sleek white, space for twenty passengers, currently configured for six plus luggage. The pilot is professional, courteous, careful. She's done this route a thousand times. Lagos to Antarctica. Refugees returning home. Families migrating for the final gathering. Everyone choosing where to die.

"Okafor-Mensah party?" the pilot confirms.

"Yes." Zara's voice steadier than she feels. "Six passengers. Six bags."

"Right on schedule. Flight time: four hours. We'll arrive Antarctica 18:00 local time. Your family's waiting."

Family. Amara. David. Elena. Kenji. Family they're moving toward. Family they haven't lost yet.

The compound gathers for final goodbye. Sixty people crowding the courtyard, spilling into the street. Mr. Okonkwo at the front, leaning heavy on his cane. Adanna and Samuel beside him. Tom. Ling. Dr. Tanaka. Everyone else whose names Zara knows, whose stories she's witnessed, whose lives intersected with hers for fifteen years.

Mr. Okonkwo raises one hand. Blessing. Goodbye. Permission to leave. "Tend gardens wherever you go. We'll tend here. Different places. Same practice. All temporary. All real."

"All real," the compound echoes.

Zara embraces him—carefully, he's so fragile now. Eighty-seven years old, five months from impact, still choosing life. Still here. "Thank you. For everything. For community."

"Thank you for teaching us how to build it."

Adanna next. Fierce embrace, no words needed. Then Samuel, Tom, Ling, Dr. Tanaka. Sixty goodbyes compressed into twenty minutes. Too fast. Too necessary. Everyone crying and laughing and holding each other like they'll never let go and then letting go because they must.

Maya and Kofi make their rounds. Hugs from everyone. Maya serious, accepting each embrace with full presence. Kofi energetic even now, bouncing between people, making promises. "I'll write!" he says. "We can message! I'll tell you about Antarctica!"

"We'll wait to hear," Dr. Tanaka says. "Tell us everything."

Finally: time. No more delays. The pilot patient but present. The transport waiting. Family inside—Kwame already loading bags, Amara and David's bags already stowed from when they arrived nine months ago.

Zara turns back once more. Sees the compound—fifty units arranged around central courtyard, rooftop gardens visible, fifteen years of life visible. Sees her balcony. Empty now. Cleaned. Ready for whoever comes next or no one.

Sees Wei's garden. The lemon tree. The gardenias. Everything blooming. Everything temporary. Everything here.

"Goodbye," she whispers.

"Not goodbye," Mr. Okonkwo calls. "See you on the other side."

There is no other side. They all know it. But the words matter anyway. Hope matters. Pretense matters. Kindness matters. Saying what should be true even when physics says otherwise.

Zara boards the transport.

---

Inside is cool and quiet. Maya and Kofi claim window seats immediately. Kwame beside Kofi. Zara beside Maya. Amara and David across the aisle—they've been waiting here since 13:30, giving the family space for goodbye.

The pilot runs through safety briefing. Emergency protocols. Flight path. Expected weather. Standard procedures executed with care despite everyone knowing that safety doesn't matter anymore. But process matters. Showing up matters. Doing the work right even when the work ends.

The transport lifts.

Maya presses her face to the window. Watching the compound shrink. The courtyard becoming small. The rooftop gardens becoming patches of green. Lagos District spreading in all directions—two million people visible from above, all temporary, all real, all here for five more months.

"I'll never see it again," Maya says quietly.

"No." Zara won't lie to her. "You won't."

"It was beautiful."

"It was."

"I'm glad I was born here. Glad I lived here. Even though—" She doesn't finish.

"Even though brief."

"Yeah."

Kofi is quieter. Watching out his window but not speaking. Kwame's hand on his shoulder. Father and son witnessing together. The silence between them comfortable. Familiar. Love made visible through presence, not words.

The transport climbs. Lagos District falls away. The engineered tropical climate giving way to natural climate patterns—heat shimmers, air currents, the physics of atmosphere. Below, the African continent. Green near the coast. Brown inland. The scars of climate change visible from altitude—dried rivers, expanded deserts, cities abandoned or flooded.

Humanity's fingerprints everywhere. All temporary. All ending.

"Mama," Maya says. "Tell me about when I was born."

Zara blinks. "You've heard that story."

"Tell me again."

So Zara tells her. Year minus 2. Pregnancy planned and wanted. Labor sixteen hours, natural birth, Maya born at dawn. First cry. First breath. First moment of existence. Two years before detection. Two years of innocence before the countdown began.

"Was it worth it?" Maya asks. "Knowing I'd only get seventeen years?"

The question lands like physics. Inevitable. Unanswerable. Essential.

"Yes," Zara says. "Every moment. Every day. Every second. You've been real, Maya. Fully yourself. Conscious and present and here. Seventeen years of that is worth—" She searches for words. "Worth everything. Worth all the grief coming. Worth the loss. Worth the pain. You matter. Not because you'll last. Because you're real."

Maya absorbs this. Nods slowly. "Kofi?"

"Worth it. Completely."

"Even though we'll die young?"

"Even though. Maybe especially because. Your father and I could have chosen safety. Could have chosen not bringing you into a dying world. But we chose you. Chose life. Chose presence. Best decision we ever made."

"You really believe that?"

"With everything I am."

Maya looks out the window again. Africa shrinking below. "Okay. Thank you. For choosing me. For bringing me here. For letting me be real even if real is brief."

Zara can't speak. Just holds her daughter's hand. Feels the warmth of it. The pulse. The life. Seventeen years, three months old. Five months remaining. Real. Here. Hers.

Across the aisle, Amara is watching. Her face wet with tears. David's arm around her. Nine months in Lagos with them. Nine months of being Aunt Amara instead of Dr. Okafor. Nine months learning presence instead of calculating distance.

"Zara," Amara calls softly. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not giving up on me. For calling Year 7. For weekly conversations. For letting me back in. For—" Her voice breaks. "For letting me be part of this. Part of them. I wasted seven years. You gave me eight years of family. That's—everything."

"You're my sister. You're family. Always were. Even when distant."

"I know. But knowing and feeling are different. I feel it now. Feel you. Feel them. Feel all of it. Thank you for teaching me how to feel again."

The transport continues south. Africa becoming water. Ocean below—vast, dark, endless. Used to be shipping lanes. Used to be filled with vessels. Now: empty. Most ships scrapped. Most travel stopped. The ocean returning to itself. Brief human interruption ending.

Maya falls asleep against the window. Exhausted from goodbye. Dreaming, probably. Her face peaceful despite everything. Kofi asleep too, head on Kwame's shoulder. Father and son both sleeping. Both trusting. Both here.

Zara sits in the quiet hum of the transport and reflects.

Fifteen years since detection. She chose life—marriage, children, engineering, community, presence. Chose defiance when despair seemed rational. Chose building when destruction was guaranteed. Chose love when loss was certain.

Others chose differently. Amara chose calculation until Year 8, then chose reconnection. Elena chose governance, bearing witness, maintaining dignity. Kenji chose seeking until Year 8, then chose presence. Ibrahim chose fighting then drifting then maintenance. David chose arrays then family.

All valid. All temporary. All complete.

And now: convergence. All of them migrating to Antarctica. Final gathering. Last months together. The ending approaching. Visible. Real. Five months. One hundred fifty-three days. Then: physics.

But today: in motion. Flying. Between Lagos and Antarctica. Between fifteen years built and five months remaining. Between home left and home arriving at. Between grief and gratitude. Between terror and presence.

Both. Always both. Everything both.

The ocean passes below. Hours of water. Hours of time. Hours that could be endless or instant depending on attention. Zara practices what Wei taught. Notices. Returns. Notices again. The transport's hum. Kwame's breathing. Maya's sleep. Kofi's trust. Her own aliveness. Her own impermanence. Her own completeness despite incompleteness.

This moment. Just this moment. Then the next. Then five months of moments. Then ending.

Enough. Has to be enough. Is enough.

---

The pilot's voice breaks the silence. "Beginning descent. Antarctica in sight. Arrival eighteen minutes."

Zara wakes Maya gently. Kwame wakes Kofi. Everyone looking out windows now. Watching the white continent emerge from ocean.

Antarctica. Megacity. Humanity's fortress against climate change. Four billion people at peak. Less than two billion now. Everyone who stayed choosing this place for their ending. The fortress becoming tomb.

But also: home. New home. Final home. Where family waits. Where Elena governs dignity. Where Kenji teaches presence. Where Amara and David built new life. Where convergence happens.

The spaceport appears—massive facility, hundreds of gates, thousands of transports coming and going. Still operating. Still functioning. Civilization maintaining itself until it can't. Five more months of this. Then silence.

The transport descends. The landing is smooth. The pilot professional to the end. "Welcome to Antarctica. Local time 18:03. Temperature minus twenty-two Celsius. District housing office will have your assignment. Your welcoming party is waiting at Gate 14."

Gate 14. Family. Amara and David gathering their bags—they'll exit together, united front, family complete. Kwame helping Kofi with his backpack. Maya holding the butterfly book, Wei's letters in her bag, everything she needs in almost nothing.

The door opens. Cold rushes in—bitter, shocking after Lagos heat. The temperature change visceral. Symbolic. Everything different now. Everything colder. Everything white where Lagos was color. Everything ending where Lagos was living.

But inside the gate: warmth.

Elena stands at the front. Seventy-eight years old now, still present, still here. Her face when she sees Kenji beside her—her son, home from teaching, here for arrival. Marcus Reyes beside them—returned from Mumbai three weeks ago, final three months with chosen family.

And others. Chen and Kowalski—Elena's Thursday people, twelve years of practice together. Ibrahim—standing with quiet competence, seven years on the arrays now. Soso Kim from the dog adoption center, teaching animal care as presence practice. Others Zara doesn't know yet but will learn. Community. Different community. Real community.

Maya steps out first. The cold hits her. She gasps. But keeps walking. Toward Elena, toward Kenji, toward family. Kofi right behind her, bouncing despite exhaustion, still himself even here.

Amara and David next. Reunion with Elena—mother and sister, mother and once-son-in-law, family complicated and real. Embraces. Tears. Welcome home even though this isn't home. Or maybe is home because home is people, not place. Home is presence. Home is here.

Zara and Kwame last. Holding hands. Stepping into the cold together. Nineteen years of stepping together. Five months more. Everything temporary. Everything precious. Everything enough.

Elena sees her. Opens her arms. "Zara. Welcome."

"Thank you for having us."

"You're family. Always room for family."

They embrace. Sister-in-law. Friend. Fellow witness to impossible years. Two women who chose presence when numbing seemed rational.

Kenji hugs her next. Nephew. Teacher. The seeker who stopped seeking and found home. "The kids have been asking about you for weeks. Maya wants to start intensive practice immediately."

"She would." Zara smiles. "She's ready."

"More than ready. She's already teaching. She'll teach others here. Keep the transmission going."

The transmission. Wei to Zara to Maya to others. Brief chain. Real chain. Sufficient chain.

"Where are we staying?" Kwame asks practically. Always the practical one. Always the steady one.

"District 8, Building 47, three-bedroom apartment," Elena says. "Larger than Lagos. Temporary housing but comfortable. Close to teaching center. Close to my office. Close to us. Five months of proximity. That's everything."

Five months. One hundred fifty-three days. Thirty-two more Thursday coffees for Elena's group. Ninety more mornings of array maintenance for Ibrahim. One hundred fifty-three more teaching sessions for Kenji. Thirty-six thousand, seven hundred and twenty more hours of consciousness. Then: nothing.

But right now: here. Family. Together. Cold and white and foreign but together. Home because presence. Home because connection. Home because choosing each other despite ending.

---

The apartment is larger than Lagos.

Ninety square meters. Three bedrooms. Kitchen with actual space. Living area that fits everyone comfortably. Windows overlooking District 8—buildings stretching infinitely, two billion people visible in lights and motion and life continuing.

Maya and Kofi claim their rooms. Maya's immediately filled with books Kenji brought—Buddhist texts, physics, philosophy. Kofi's filled with nothing yet but will be soon. Boy's energy unstoppable even after travel.

The kitchen has supplies. Elena arranged it. Food for tonight. Tea. Basics. Enough to begin.

Kwame starts making dinner. His ritual. His centering. His love language. Synth-protein and vegetables. Simple food. Real food. First meal in new home. Last home. Temporary home. Real home.

Zara stands at the window watching Antarctica settle into evening. The lights below. The megacity breathing. Two billion people choosing this ending together. Anonymous. Connected. Both.

Amara joins her at the window. Silent at first. Then: "It's strange. Leaving Lagos. Coming here. Everything different."

"Everything same," Zara counters. "Same family. Same practice. Same presence. Different location. Same essentials."

"How do you do it?"

"Do what?"

"Stay present. Stay calm. Five months left. Your children dying. How are you not screaming constantly?"

Zara considers. True answer. Full answer. "I scream internally. Constantly. Every moment I look at Maya and Kofi I'm screaming. But—" She searches for words Wei would use. "But the screaming and the presence aren't opposites. I can scream AND be here. Can grieve AND love. Can be terrified AND show up. Wei taught me that. Feelings don't prevent presence. Hiding from feelings prevents presence. So I feel all of it. Let it be there. Stay here anyway."

Amara absorbs this. "I'm seven years behind you in practice."

"You're doing fine. You came to Lagos. You're here. You're present. That's all anyone can do."

They stand together. Sisters. Forty-eight and sixty-one. Both survived detection. Both changed. Both here.

"Thank you," Amara says again. "For—everything."

"Stop thanking me. We're family. This is what family does. Shows up. Stays present. Loves despite loss."

Behind them, sounds of life. Maya explaining something to Kenji—probably physics. Kofi laughing at something David said. Kwame cooking. Elena discussing tomorrow's schedule with Marcus. Chen and Kowalski saying goodbye, promising to return tomorrow. Normal sounds. Domestic sounds. Family sounds.

Everything temporary. Everything enough.

---

First night in Antarctica.

The apartment quiet. Maya and Kofi sleeping. Amara and David in their room. Everyone exhausted from travel. From goodbye. From transition. From everything.

Zara lies beside Kwame in unfamiliar bed. The window shows unfamiliar city. The sounds are unfamiliar—Antarctic winds instead of Lagos warmth. Everything different. Everything strange.

"You okay?" Kwame whispers.

"No. You?"

"No."

They lie in honest darkness. Not okay. Not pretending to be okay. Just: here. Together. Present to not-okay-ness.

"Five months," Zara says.

"Five months."

"Maya will be seventeen years, eight months. Still seventeen. Never eighteen."

"I know."

"Kofi will be fourteen years, eight months. Never fifteen."

"I know."

"We'll watch them die."

"Yes."

The silence holds them. The truth holds them. The impossibility holds them. And underneath: the presence. The practice. The Wei-taught, community-built, fifteen-years-developed capacity to be with what is without flinching away.

"I'm glad we're here," Kwame says. "Glad we came. Glad we'll be together."

"Me too."

"I love you. Have loved you nineteen years. Will love you five more months. Would love you longer if longer existed."

"I love you too. Thank you for being steady. For being here. For being you."

"Thank you for teaching me how to be present. You learned from Wei. I learned from you. Now the kids learning from us. Transmission. That matters."

"It does."

They hold each other. First night in Antarctica. Last home. Five months remaining. Three months as family unit here. Then two months until impact. Then nothing.

But tonight: this. Kwame's warmth. The unfamiliar ceiling. The knowledge that family sleeps nearby. That tomorrow brings new routines. That presence continues until presence ends. That brief is enough. That temporary is complete. That home is wherever you practice being here.

The flower bloomed. The flower blooms. The flower will bloom until it can't. That's the teaching. That's everything.

Zara closes her eyes. Tomorrow will bring challenges. Adjustment. Grief. Practice. Teaching. Living. The same things every day brings. The same things these five months will bring.

But first: sleep. First: rest. First: this moment of quiet before tomorrow begins.

Five months. Enough time. Not enough time. Exactly the time they have.

She sleeps.

**END PART III: SEARCHING**

Fifteen years of separation ended. Eight years of reconnection completed. Family converged. Practice established. Community built in Lagos, left with love. Community beginning in Antarctica, embraced with presence.

Years 8-15 covered. Everyone positioned for final convergence. Individual transformations achieved. Ibrahim recovered through maintenance. Amara reconnected through love. Elena transformed through witness. Kenji returned through teaching. David completed arrays. Zara built everything that matters.

Maya at seventeen—nearly adult, completely herself, ready to teach. Kofi at fourteen—still young, fully present, learning fast. Both practiced. Both conscious. Both dying in five months. Both here now.

Part IV awaits. Year 15, Months 2-6. Final five months. The teaching spreading. The convergence deepening. The asteroid approaching. The ending arriving. The presence continuing until presence ends.

But tonight: sleep in Antarctica. Family together. First night of final chapter. Beginning of end. Home.

Always home.

Here.
