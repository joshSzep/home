# Chapter 40: Migration

**Dr. Amara Okafor | Year 13, Month 3 | Antarctic Monitoring Station**

---

The trajectory update completes at 3:47 AM.

Amara sits alone at her workstation—the only occupied seat among twenty, the only human presence in a facility designed for essential operations. Thirteen years of this. Thirteen years of overnight data streams, trajectory refinements, countdown maintenance. The monitoring station hums its familiar lullaby around her: cooling systems, processors, the soft whir of automation doing what humans used to do.

**Object 3025-AZ1**  
**Impact: Year 15, Day 365**  
**Probability: 99.97% (unchanged)**  
**Time remaining: 2 years, 9 months, 22 days**

The numbers are perfect. Have been perfect for thirteen years. The asteroid approaches with mathematical precision—exactly where physics says it should be, exactly when the calculations predict. Her work is complete. Has been complete since Year 0, Day 1, really. Everything since has been verification. Witness. Documentation of the inevitable.

Amara closes the trajectory file. Pulls up her secondary dataset—mortality statistics, global aggregate. Old habit. She stopped filing these reports years ago. No one reads them. But she still tracks the numbers.

**Total deaths Years 1-13: 3,847,192,391**

Nearly four billion people. Dead in thirteen years. Not from the asteroid—from despair, violence, abandonment. The slow dying before the fast dying. Numbers she processes clinically, professionally. Numbers that used to mean nothing when she was numb.

Now they mean something. Not everything—she's not that healed. But something. Each billion contains her sister. Contains her niece and nephew. Contains David. Contains everyone she's learned to love again after years of choosing data over connection.

She files the report. Sends it to the archive. Ritual without audience. But someone should document. Someone should count. Even if the counting itself ends.

Her tablet chimes. Message from Zara—sent twelve hours ago, Lagos evening. Amara opens it.

A photo. Maya and Kofi in Wei's garden, the lemon tree behind them. Maya is fifteen years, five months old now—tall, serious, holding a physics textbook like it's light reading. Kofi is twelve years, five months—grinning, covered in soil from the tomato plants, radiating that unstoppable energy he's had since birth. The caption reads: *The kids wanted you to see the new garden expansion. Maya designed the water system. Kofi planted everything. They miss their aunt.*

Amara stares at the photo. These children. Her niece and nephew. She'd ignored their existence for seven years—Years 0 through 7—choosing isolation over family, numbness over feeling. Then reconnection. Slow, painful, necessary reconnection. Weekly calls Year 8. Three visits per year Years 8 through 13. Learning to be Aunt Amara instead of Dr. Okafor, astrophysicist, bearer of extinction.

Maya's brilliance still takes her breath away. Like looking in a mirror that reflects both similarity and difference. The girl has Amara's mathematical mind—asks about orbital mechanics, trajectory calculations, the physics ending them. But Maya also cries at sad films. Laughs with her brother. Loves fiercely. Balanced in ways Amara never managed.

And Kofi. Pure joy made incarnate. Twelve years old and deeply interested in butterflies, carpentry, the way mint spreads in containers. Nothing like Amara. Everything wonderful. He calls her Aunt Amara with casual affection, as if seven years of her absence never happened. Children forgive in ways adults can't.

She's visited them thirteen times since Year 8. Two weeks here, one week there. Enough to build relationship. Not enough to heal the seven years wasted. Not enough for what's coming.

Two years, nine months, twenty-two days remaining.

Maya will die at seventeen years, seven months. Kofi at fourteen years, six months. Zara at forty-eight years. All of them too young. All of them temporary. All of them real.

Amara types a response: *Beautiful garden. Tell Maya I want to see her calculations. Tell Kofi the mint looks perfect. Love you all.*

She sends it. Watches the message status change from sending to delivered. Technology still functioning. Civilization still operating. Two more years of that, probably. Then physics.

The monitoring station is silent around her. Has been silent for six years—since Year 7, when the last colleague left. Sixty workstations. One person. The facility was supposed to be essential operations, minimal staff, maintaining surveillance until impact. Instead: Amara alone, watching numbers that don't change, documenting an approach that doesn't deviate.

She could leave. Has been able to leave for years. The systems are fully automated. Her presence is unnecessary. She shows up because—why? Habit. Identity. The same reason David maintained solar arrays for twelve years when robots could do it better. Work as meaning. Presence as purpose. Showing up because showing up matters, even when outcomes don't.

But David left. Year 13, Month 1. Two months ago. Transferred to Lagos to be with her, with Zara's family, for the remaining time. He'd announced it back in Year 10—three years of preparation, saying goodbye to Platform 73 and robot 47B, choosing family over isolated purpose.

Amara hasn't announced anything. Hasn't prepared. Hasn't decided.

But Maya's photo sits on her screen. The kids miss their aunt. And Amara misses them. Misses Zara. Misses the warmth of that Lagos compound with its rooftop gardens and communal dinners and Wei's teachings still echoing through everything.

Misses being part of something larger than calculations.

She pulls up her personal files. Reviews the visit logs. Year 8: three one-week visits. Year 9: two two-week visits. Year 10: three one-week visits. Year 11: two two-week visits, including the one when Wei died and Maya awakened to mortality. Year 12: three visits. Year 13: one so far, scheduled for another next month.

Regular visits. Building relationship. Learning to be sister again, aunt for the first time. But always returning here. Always choosing the monitoring station as home base. Always maintaining her identity as Dr. Okafor, astrophysicist, the woman who detected the end.

Two years, nine months, twenty-two days left.

How does she want to spend them?

The question surfaces with uncomfortable clarity. Not abstract anymore. Not theoretical. Actual choice requiring actual decision. Stay here monitoring trajectory that doesn't need monitoring? Or go to Lagos and be family?

Amara stands. Walks the empty corridors. Motion-activated lights flickering on, dying behind her. Twenty workstations dark. Fifty dormitories empty except one. A tomb staffed by someone who forgot how to leave.

No. That's not fair. She's not trapped. Not numb anymore. She's choosing this. Has been choosing it for thirteen years. But choice implies alternatives, and the alternative is sitting in Wei's garden watching Maya explain physics and Kofi chase butterflies and Zara build the life Amara was too afraid to build.

She returns to her workstation. Opens her message queue. Finds David's contact. They talk daily now—two years of dating after eight years apart. Rebuilding what broke. Learning each other again. It's tentative, fragile, but real. And he's in Lagos now. Waiting.

She types: *Are you awake?*

His response comes immediately: *Always. For you.*

Something warm moves through her chest. Not quite the emotion she remembers from before detection, before numbness. But closer. Real enough.

*Can we video call?*

*Of course.*

His face appears on her screen moments later. Sixty-one years old now. Five years older than her, though they'd seemed the same age when they were young. Grey throughout his hair now. Lines around his eyes. But present. Actually here. Looking at her with concern and love and patience.

"Hi," she says.

"Hi. It's late there. Or early. 3:47 AM?"

She smiles slightly. "How did you know?"

"You always work the detection anniversary. Thirteen years today."

Has it been? Amara checks the date. Year 13, Month 3, Day 1. Thirteen years exactly since she detected the asteroid. Since the universe ended. She hadn't even realized.

"I didn't remember," she admits.

"That's progress." David's voice is gentle. "Means it's not the only thing you think about anymore."

Is that true? Amara considers. Thirteen years ago she would have been counting down to this anniversary for weeks. Preparing. Dreading. Now: she forgot. Because other things matter more. Maya's photo. Kofi's garden. Zara's warmth. David's presence.

"I got a message from Zara," Amara says. "Photo of the kids. They miss me."

"They do. Maya asks about you constantly. When are you visiting next? Can Aunt Amara explain this equation? Does she think my water system design is efficient?" He pauses. "She wants to impress you."

"She already impresses me. She's brilliant."

"She wants you to see it. Be here for it. Not just visit—be here."

The words hang between them. Be here. Not visit. Stay. Be family instead of occasional aunt. Be present for two years, nine months instead of scattered weeks.

"I don't know how," Amara hears herself say. "I've been here forty-three years. Since Year minus thirty. This is—" She gestures at the empty station. "This is who I am."

"You're more than this."

"Am I?" The question comes out sharper than intended. "I detected the asteroid. I calculated everyone's death. I documented the dying. That's my role. That's what I do."

"That's what you did. For thirteen years. You did it. The work is complete." David leans closer to the camera. "Amara. The trajectory doesn't need you. The calculations are automated. You're choosing to stay in that empty building because it's safe. Because identity is easier than transformation. Because work is familiar even when it's pointless."

The words land like impact. Not cruel—true. She's hiding. Still hiding. Not in numbness anymore, but in purpose. In duty. In the fiction that monitoring matters when monitoring is automatic.

"I'm scared," she admits quietly.

"Of what?"

"Of being family. Of spending two years with them and then—" She can't finish.

"And then losing them," David completes. "I know. I'm terrified too. But Amara—we lose them either way. Here or there, monitoring station or Lagos, isolated or together. They die in two years. We die in two years. The physics is absolute. But we get to choose how we spend the time."

"You chose. Year 10. You decided to leave the arrays, leave 47B, come to Lagos. It seemed easy for you."

David laughs. Gentle, not mocking. "It wasn't easy. It was the hardest decision I've made. Leaving Platform 73 meant leaving twelve years of purpose. Leaving my only real partnership. 47B and I—we had something. Real presence. Real connection. Leaving that hurt."

"But you did it."

"Because you matter more. Because family matters more. Because two years maintaining arrays alone versus two years with you and Zara's family—that's not even a choice. One is survival. The other is life."

Amara looks at his face on the screen. This man who tried to reach her for years while she was numb. Who divorced her Year 4 when she gave him nothing. Who opened his door Year 8 when she finally knocked. Who chose her over his life's work.

"I wasted seven years," she says.

"We both did. Can't change that. But we have two years. Almost three. We can waste those too, or we can show up."

Show up. The phrase Zara uses. The practice Wei taught. Presence as enough. Being here while here lasts.

"When?" Amara asks.

David's expression shifts. Hope carefully contained. "When what?"

"When should I come? To Lagos. To stay."

He's silent for a long moment. Processing. Believing. "You're serious."

"I don't know how to do this. Don't know how to leave. Don't know how to be sister and aunt instead of scientist. But—" She looks at Maya's photo still open on her second screen. "But I want to try. I don't want to spend two more years alone. Don't want to miss what's left."

"Next month," David says immediately. "Year 13, Month 4. Give yourself time to arrange things. Close out projects. Say goodbye. But not too long. We don't have too long."

Two years, nine months, twenty-two days. Minus one month for preparation. Two years, eight months, twenty-two days with family. Not enough. Could never be enough. But more than thirteen scattered visits.

"Okay," Amara says. "Month 4. I'll come."

"To visit?"

"To stay. For the end. To be family."

David's eyes are wet. "You're sure?"

"No. Terrified. But sure enough. You're right—we lose them either way. I'd rather lose them while holding their hands than from two thousand kilometers away watching data streams."

"Zara will cry."

"Zara's been crying for thirteen years. I owe her two more years of presence. Of being the sister I couldn't be before."

"Maya will monopolize your time. Physics questions constantly."

"Good. I want her to. Want to teach her everything I know. Everything Wei taught Zara who taught Maya. Want to—" Her voice catches. "Want to be useful to her. Before she dies at seventeen."

They sit in silence. Two people on opposite sides of a screen, two thousand kilometers apart, making plans for how to spend the time remaining. Plans that should be normal—moving to be with family—except nothing is normal when everyone has expiration dates.

"I love you," David says. "Should say that more. We have two years. Should say it constantly."

"I love you too." The words come easier now. Not easy—but easier. "Thank you for waiting. For not giving up after the divorce. For opening the door when I finally knocked."

"Thank you for knocking."

They end the call. Amara sits alone in the monitoring station at 4:17 AM, thirty minutes after the thirteen-year anniversary of detection, and feels: different. Not fixed. Not healed completely. But decided. Choosing. Active instead of passive. Moving toward family instead of hiding in work.

She pulls up her personnel files. Begins drafting transition plans. The monitoring station will continue functioning—automation handles everything. But protocol requires formal transfer. Training replacement. Closing out tenure.

Forty-three years. She arrived Year minus thirty as young researcher, twenty-three years old, brilliant and ambitious and certain the stars were her future. Spent thirty years here before detection. Thirteen years after. Built career. Built identity. Became Dr. Amara Okafor, expert in Near-Earth Objects, the woman who watches the sky.

Now: time to become something else. Someone else. Sister. Aunt. Partner. Human instead of calculator.

The forms are straightforward. Request for transfer. Effective date: Year 13, Month 4, Day 1. Destination: Lagos District. Reason: family relocation. Duration: permanent.

Permanent. The word is absurd when nothing is permanent anymore. But she types it anyway. Permanent as in: not coming back. Permanent as in: choosing family over work for the remaining time. Permanent as in: this identity ending so another can begin.

She files the request. The system acknowledges. Processes. Approved within minutes—computers don't care about forty-three-year tenures ending. Don't care that this is goodbye to everything she's been.

Amara stands. Walks to the window. Antarctica spreads below—the megacity glowing in pre-dawn darkness. Four billion people at peak. Maybe two billion now. Population declining as people flee to preferred locations for their final years. The fortress continent becoming tomb.

She's leaving it. Leaving this building, this work, this identity. Moving to Lagos where it's warm and green and full of life choosing to continue despite doom.

Scary. Right. Both.

Her tablet chimes. Zara responding to her earlier message: *The kids are asleep but they'll love hearing from you tomorrow. Maya has seventeen questions about gravitational perturbation effects. Kofi wants to know if you like butterflies. When are you visiting next? We miss you.*

Amara looks at the message. At the casual affection. At the assumption that she'll visit, return, maintain pattern. At the question she's about to answer differently than Zara expects.

She types: *Not visiting. Coming to stay. Year 13, Month 4. David and I. For the end. To be family. If you'll have us.*

Sends it before she can second-guess.

The message status changes: delivered. Then: read. Then: three dots indicating Zara is typing. Then nothing. The dots disappear. Reappear. Disappear. Amara watches this cycle repeat—her sister processing, feeling, trying to find words.

Finally: *Are you serious?*

*Yes.*

*You're leaving Antarctica? The monitoring station? After forty-three years?*

*Yes.*

*Why?*

Amara considers. Why? Because David is right. Because Maya invited her without knowing she was inviting. Because Kofi deserves to know his aunt. Because Zara kept trying for thirteen years and earned this. Because two years hiding is worse than two years risking. Because presence matters more than purpose. Because family is real and calculations are safe but real is better.

She types: *Because I don't want to die alone. Because you're my sister. Because Maya and Kofi are my family. Because two years together is better than two years apart. Because I wasted seven years being numb and I don't want to waste two more being scared.*

The dots again. Long pause. Then:

*Oh, Amara.*

Just that. Two words. But Amara can hear them—the tears, the relief, the joy, the grief for time lost, the gratitude for time remaining. Everything Zara feels compressed into two words because more would overflow.

Then: *Yes. Yes, of course we'll have you. The kids will be—oh my god, Maya will die from excitement. Kofi will actually explode. When? When are you coming? What do you need? Where will you stay? We'll make room. We'll—*

Amara smiles reading the flood of messages. Her sister. Intense, loving, present Zara who builds community and tends gardens and chose to have a second child after detection because life matters despite ending.

*Month 4, Day 1. I'll arrange housing nearby. Don't want to burden you. But close. Walking distance. I want to be with you but not on top of you.*

*You could never burden us. But yes. Close is good. The compound has vacancies. I'll ask around. We'll find something perfect.*

They message back and forth for twenty minutes. Logistics. Details. What to bring. What to leave. How to ship belongings. When to tell the kids. Zara's excitement is palpable even through text—capital letters, multiple punctuation marks, words Amara hasn't seen from her sister in years. Joy. Pure joy at family reuniting.

Finally: *I need to sleep. But Amara—thank you. Thank you for choosing us. For coming. For being brave enough to leave. I love you so much.*

*I love you too. Tell Maya and Kofi in the morning. I'll call tomorrow after they know. I want to hear their reaction.*

*They'll want to hear yours when I tell them!*

Amara imagines it. Zara gathering the kids at breakfast. Saying: Aunt Amara is coming to stay. For the rest of the time. She's leaving Antarctica to be with us. Maya's face—shock, then analysis, then probably seventeen immediate questions. Kofi's reaction—pure explosive joy, bouncing, shouting, making plans for what they'll do together.

Her niece and nephew. She'll know them completely now. Won't miss the remaining two years. Will teach Maya everything. Will learn butterflies with Kofi. Will be present to their complete, abbreviated, beautiful lives.

And Zara. Her sister. Whom she ignored for seven years, reconnected with slowly, loved from distance. Now: proximity. Daily presence. Sisterhood not as concept but as lived reality. Shared meals. Shared grief. Shared remaining time.

Worth it. Terrifying and worth it.

The monitoring station feels different now. Not home anymore. Way station. Place she's leaving. The nostalgia arrives premature but real—forty-three years here. Became herself here. Detected the asteroid here. Lost herself here. Found herself again here. This building holds all of it.

But she's leaving. In one month. Final goodbye to Dr. Amara Okafor, astrophysicist, woman of data and isolation. Becoming: Aunt Amara. Sister Amara. Amara who shows up instead of calculating from distance.

She walks through the facility one more time. Twenty workstations silent. Fifty dormitories empty. The common areas—break room where she made tea alone for years, briefing room where she delivered extinction calculations, observation deck where she watched the Antarctic megacity decline. Forty-three years of memories in titanium and polymer and glass.

Goodbye to all of it. In one month.

She returns to her workstation. 5:34 AM. Almost time for shift change—except there are no shifts anymore. No colleagues. Just automation and Amara maintaining vigil out of habit and fear.

One more month of vigil. Then: something else. Something harder. Something real.

She pulls up the trajectory one final time this morning. Reviews the data. Observation 4,745,827. The asteroid is exactly where it should be. Exactly when it should be there. Perfect mathematics. Perfect physics. Perfect certainty.

**Time remaining: 2 years, 9 months, 21 days, 19 hours, 13 minutes**

Close enough to two years, nine months. Close enough to the time she has left with Maya at fifteen, Kofi at twelve, Zara at forty-six. Close enough to learn presence instead of just calculating it. Close enough to be family instead of documenting from distance. Close enough to die together instead of alone.

Amara begins her daily report. Last line before filing: *Transfer requested. Effective Year 13, Month 4, Day 1. Dr. Amara Okafor relocating Lagos District for family proximity remaining duration. Automated systems sufficient. Human oversight no longer required. Work complete.*

Work complete. Three words. Forty-three years reduced to three words. But accurate. Her work is complete. Was complete years ago. Everything since has been—what? Maintenance. Witness. Hiding. Depends on the perspective.

From today forward: family. Presence. Living instead of calculating life.

She files the report. Closes the monitoring systems. Her shift ends. Usually she'd stay—no reason to leave, nowhere to go. Today: she goes to the dormitory, to the small room she's occupied for nine years. Looks at the space. Sleeping mat. Storage cube. Terminal. No photos. No plants. No decoration. Just: function. Survival. Isolation made manifest.

One month to pack this. One month to say goodbye. One month to close forty-three years and open two years, nine months.

Enough time. Barely. But enough.

She lies down. Closes her eyes. Sleep comes slowly, but when it comes, she dreams: Maya explaining orbital mechanics, hands moving with fierce intelligence. Kofi laughing in the garden, covered in soil and joy. Zara tending flowers, teaching presence through watering. David beside her, quiet and solid and here.

Family. Her family. Who she's returning to. Who she'll spend the remaining time with. Who she'll die alongside instead of calculating from distance.

Two years, nine months, twenty-one days.

Not enough.

Better than alone.

So much better than alone.

---

The next morning—0800 hours, civilized time—Amara calls Lagos. Zara answers immediately, face filling the screen. Behind her: controlled chaos. Maya pacing, holding her tablet, visibly bursting with questions. Kofi bouncing on furniture, unable to contain himself.

"You told them," Amara observes.

"Of course I told them!" Zara's grinning. Actually grinning. "Maya didn't sleep. Been calculating everything since 0600. Kofi's been making plans for butterfly expeditions since the moment he woke. They want to talk to you. Both of them. Immediately. Possibly simultaneously."

"Put them on."

Zara moves the camera. Maya's face appears—fifteen years old and so serious. "Aunt Amara. Zara says you're relocating Lagos District Year 13 Month 4. Permanence through impact date. Confirm?"

Amara smiles at the formal language. Her niece doing scientist-talk. "Confirmed."

"Rationale?"

"Because I want to be with you. With Kofi. With your mama. With David. Because two years together is better than two years apart."

Maya's composure cracks. Tears suddenly streaming. "I wanted to ask you but didn't know how. I wanted—I wanted you here but thought you couldn't leave. Thought your work was more important. Thought—" She stops. Crying fully now.

"My work is complete," Amara says gently. "You're more important. You've always been more important. I was just too scared to admit it."

"I have so many questions. About orbital mechanics. About your trajectory models. About gravitational perturbations and—"

"I have two years. We'll answer all of them. Every single one. I'll teach you everything I know."

Maya nods, wiping her face. "Okay. Good. Yes. I'm going to prepare a list. Seventeen categories. Subcategories for each. We'll need organized study schedule to optimize—"

Zara's voice off-camera: "Maya. Your aunt is also allowed to rest."

"Rest is inefficient use of remaining time."

"Rest is human."

"I'm aware of mammalian biological requirements." But Maya smiles. "Fine. Scheduled rest breaks. But mostly: physics."

Amara laughs. Really laughs. First genuine laugh in—how long? Weeks? Months? "Physics and rest breaks. Agreed."

Kofi's face suddenly fills the screen, pushing Maya aside. "AUNT AMARA! You're coming! Mama says you're coming! Forever! Until the asteroid! Are you going to live with us? Can you share my room? I have a balcony garden! Do you like butterflies? I have a book! Grandmother Wei gave it to me! There are twelve species in Lagos! Do you want to catch them? Not catch catch. Just observe. Catch-and-release. Do you—"

"Kofi." Zara's hand appears, gently redirecting him. "Breathe."

"I'm breathing! But Aunt Amara's COMING!"

"Yes," Amara says. "I'm coming. And yes, I want to see your butterflies. And yes, I want to learn about the garden. And yes, we'll spend time together. Lots of time."

"TWO YEARS!" Kofi shouts. "That's—how many days is that?"

"Approximately nine hundred fifty days," Maya answers immediately. "Give or take, depending on exact impact date calculation."

"That's SO MANY days! We can do butterfly observation EVERY day! Well. Maybe not every day. But many days! Enough days! Right, Aunt Amara? Enough days?"

Amara feels her throat tighten. Enough days. Nine hundred fifty days with a nephew who'll die at fourteen. A niece who'll die at seventeen. A sister who'll die at forty-nine. Enough days?

No. Could never be enough.

But more than zero. More than scattered visits. More than calculating from distance.

"Yes, Kofi," she says. "Enough days."

Zara reclaims the camera. Her eyes are wet. "Thank you," she mouths silently. Then aloud: "We'll find you housing. Compound has two vacancies—both small but close. One floor below us. Walking distance to everything. We'll—"

"Whatever you find is fine. I don't need much. Just—proximity. Family. Presence."

"You'll have it. All of it. The kids won't leave you alone. Fair warning."

"Good. I don't want to be alone anymore."

They talk logistics for thirty minutes. What to ship. What to leave. The compound's community structure. Meals. Gardens. The teaching circle that Kenji established after returning from his wandering years—now continued despite his absence, presence practice spreading through community. Dr. Tanaka sometimes attending. Local volunteers. People learning to be present despite doom.

Amara will join that. Will practice. Will learn what David learned through arrays, what Zara learned through Wei, what Maya is learning through grief transformed. Will become practitioner instead of calculator. Present instead of numb.

One month until migration. Thirty days to close forty-three years. To pack a life. To say goodbye to identity. To prepare for family instead of isolation.

Scary. Right. Both.

The call ends. Amara sits in her dormitory room. The space that's been home for nine years feels temporary now. Already leaving. Already moving toward something else.

She pulls up her files. Begins sorting. What to keep. What to leave. What matters when you're dying in two years. Photos—few, but meaningful. Research notes—extensive, but unnecessary. Personal effects—minimal by design. She's lived like she's been camping. Temporary. Uncommitted. Ready to flee at any moment.

No more fleeing. Time to commit. To plant roots in Lagos soil knowing roots will burn. To build family knowing family will end. To love knowing loss is certain.

That's presence. That's practice. That's what Wei taught Zara who's teaching Maya who'll teach—whom? There won't be time for Maya to teach anyone except Kofi. The transmission ends with them. Two young practitioners dying before mastery. Before anything except beginning.

Tragic. And complete anyway. Wei taught that. Brief doesn't mean incomplete. Maya practicing for two years, dying at seventeen, but fully present for those two years—that's complete. That's enough. That's everything.

Amara starts packing.

---

## One Month Later — Year 13, Month 4, Day 1

The transport descends through Lagos District airspace at midday.

Amara watches through the window. The megacity spreading below—five million people, engineered tropical climate, green spaces among the buildings. So different from Antarctica's ice and titanium. So alive. She hasn't lived anywhere warm since—when? Mumbai, twenty-four years ago? Before Antarctica claimed her completely?

David sits beside her. Quiet. Solid. He made this journey two months ago. Now making it again beside her. Supporting her migration. Witnessing her transformation. Being partner through the terrifying.

"Nervous?" he asks.

"Terrified."

"Me too. And I've already done this."

"How was it? Moving here?"

"Hard. Good. Leaving the arrays hurt more than I expected. Even knowing it was right. Even wanting to be here. Still—hurt." He takes her hand. "But being here with Zara's family, with the community, with you when you visited—that was worth it. That's real life. The arrays were practice. This is application."

The transport docks. Disembarkation procedures. Customs. Immigration. Everything still functioning. Civilization persisting another day. One thousand seven hundred thirty days until it stops. But today: functioning.

Amara and David collect their bags—everything she owns reduced to three containers. Forty-three years of life fitting in three shipping cubes. Minimalism by design. Or failure to accumulate anything meaningful. Perspective matters.

They exit into the arrival hall.

And there: family.

Zara standing at the front, face already wet with tears. Kwame beside her, solid and welcoming. Maya and Kofi bouncing—literally bouncing—unable to contain themselves. Behind them: others. Tom, the compound engineer. Mr. Okonkwo, ancient and wise. Adanna and her son Samuel. Ling, who cared for Wei. Community coming to welcome new members.

Amara freezes. Too many people. Too much presence. Too—

Kofi breaks free. Runs toward her. Crashes into her legs with a hug that nearly knocks her over. "YOU'RE HERE! You're ACTUALLY here! Not visiting! STAYING!"

Then Maya, more controlled but equally intense. "Aunt Amara. Welcome to Lagos District. I prepared a study schedule. Optimal time allocation. We can begin tomorrow if you're not too tired from transport—"

"Maya, let her breathe." Zara is there suddenly. Arms around Amara. Holding her. Squeezing too tight. "You came. You actually came. I can't believe—I kept thinking you'd change your mind. That something would—but you're here. You're really here."

"I'm here." Amara's voice is muffled against her sister's shoulder. "I'm here. I'm staying. I'm—" She can't finish. Crying suddenly. Overwhelmed. Terrified. Grateful. Home.

They hold each other. Two sisters. Nine years estranged. Six years reconnecting. Now: together. For the remaining time. However long that is. However brief.

Kwame approaches David. "Welcome back. Second arrival in two months. Must mean you like it here."

David smiles. "The company's good."

"And the work?"

"Still figuring that out. But I'm teaching adaptive carpentry at the community center. Maintaining muscle memory. Staying useful."

"Good man." Kwame claps his shoulder. "Come. Let's get them home. The kids will talk Amara's ear off if we don't establish boundaries now."

The group moves toward transport. Amara surrounded by family, community, noise, life. So different from the monitoring station's silence. So overwhelming. So real.

Maya walks beside her, already explaining: "Your housing is Unit 4B. One floor below us. Forty-seven square meters. Balcony facing west. Kwame installed shelving for your books. I calculated optimal organization by subject matter—"

"Maya." Zara's voice, gentle but firm. "Your aunt just arrived."

"I know. I'm helping her acclimate. Providing information. Facilitating transition—"

"You're overwhelming her."

Maya looks at Amara. Sees something in her face. "Oh. Sorry. I'll—I'll be quiet. For now. But later we talk?"

"Later we talk," Amara agrees. "About physics. About everything. But yes. Later. Let me breathe first."

"Breathing is important. Cellular respiration. Oxygen uptake. Without breathing—"

"Maya."

"Right. Quiet now. Breathing time."

But she stays close. Kofi too. Both children flanking their aunt like guardians. Like they're afraid she'll disappear if they don't maintain contact. Maybe they're right to worry. Amara's spent thirteen years disappearing. Old habits.

Not anymore. Not this time. She's here. She's staying. She's committed.

The compound rises before them—fifty units, rooftop thick with green. Wei's garden visible from here, maintained by Ling and others. The lemon tree standing patient. Fifty-two years old. Three more until impact. Same as Zara's age at death.

Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything here.

They enter the building. Climb stairs—elevator's working but Maya insists stairs are better for cardiovascular health and besides Aunt Amara needs to see the building's vertical garden system which Tom designed and isn't it impressive?

Fourth floor. Unit 4B. Kwame unlocks it. "Welcome home."

Amara steps inside. Small space. Forty-seven square meters. Living area. Kitchen alcove. Bedroom. Bathroom. Balcony facing west. Shelves installed—empty, waiting for the books shipping separately. Furniture minimal but sufficient. Window showing the compound's rooftop gardens and beyond: Lagos District stretching to horizon.

Home. For nine hundred days. Until everything ends. Home.

"It's perfect," she says.

Zara exhales. "You're sure? If you need anything—"

"It's perfect. Really. I don't need much. Just—" She gestures vaguely. "This. You. Family. Enough."

They help her unpack what she brought. Clothes. Terminal. Personal effects. Tea kettle—David carried it specifically because he knows Amara's morning ritual. Some things don't change. Shouldn't change. Tea at dawn while the city wakes. Presence practice through caffeine.

By evening, the apartment is functional. Basic. Temporary. Real. Amara stands on the balcony watching sunset paint the district orange and gold. Different light than Antarctica's. Warmer. Closer. Alive.

Footsteps behind her. David joins her at the railing. "How are you?"

"Terrified. Relieved. Exhausted. Grateful." She leans against him. "All of it."

"That's fair. All appropriate responses to life change."

"Is it life change? Or death change? Moving to die together instead of apart?"

"Both. Neither. Does it matter? We're here. That's what matters."

Below them: the compound. People gathering for evening meal. Community continuing. Voices rising. Laughter. Life persisting. Everyone here knows their expiration date. Everyone showing up anyway. Building meaning despite. Creating presence through. Living until they can't.

Amara will join that. Will become part of this community. Will learn its rhythms. Will tend gardens with Zara. Will study physics with Maya. Will chase butterflies with Kofi. Will teach what she knows. Will learn what she doesn't. Will be sister and aunt and partner and practitioner.

Will die here. With them. Together.

Not alone in a monitoring station counting down. Not isolated in data. Not calculating from distance. Here. Present. Family.

Scary. Right. Both.

"Thank you," she says to David.

"For what?"

"For showing me this was possible. For leaving first. For proving that choosing family over work doesn't destroy you. For being patient while I figured it out. For—" She stops. "For not giving up on me."

"You're worth not giving up on." He kisses her forehead. "Come on. Zara's making dinner. The kids will monopolize you. Welcome to family life."

They go downstairs. Unit 5B. Zara's apartment. Doors open—community compound, privacy optional. Inside: organized chaos. Kwame cooking. Zara setting table. Maya reading physics at the table while simultaneously helping. Kofi showing everyone his newest butterfly sketch.

"Aunt Amara!" Kofi spots her. "Look! I drew Danaus chrysippus! The African monarch! See the orange wings? The black pattern? Do you think it's accurate?"

Amara studies the drawing. Precise. Careful. Real love visible in each line. "It's beautiful."

"I can teach you to draw them! Or we can observe real ones! Or both! We have time! Nine hundred days is lots of time for butterfly observation! Right?"

Nine hundred days. Two years, five months, give or take. Kofi will spend it drawing butterflies, learning carpentry from Kwame, growing in ways that end at fourteen. Maya will spend it studying physics, practicing presence, becoming practitioner who dies before mastery. Zara will spend it mothering, teaching, being exactly who she's been for sixteen years—present despite doom.

And Amara will spend it here. With them. Being family. Learning life. Choosing presence over calculation. Becoming sister and aunt instead of Dr. Okafor, astrophysicist, bearer of extinction.

"Yes, Kofi," she says. "Lots of time. Let's use it well."

They sit for dinner. Seven people around a table—Zara's family and David and Amara. Eating synth-protein curry. Drinking mint tea from the balcony garden. Talking about butterflies and physics and carpentry and tomorrow's plans. Normal conversation. Beautiful conversation. Temporary conversation. Real conversation.

Amara sits among them and feels: different. Not fixed. Not healed completely. But present. Actually here. Part of something larger than herself. Part of family who chose her despite seven years of absence. Part of community who welcomed her despite being stranger. Part of life continuing despite certain death.

This is what she left Antarctica for. This presence. This connection. This reality.

Worth it. Absolutely worth it.

Two years, five months left. Give or take. Depending on exact impact date. She stops calculating. Just: here. Now. This meal. This family. This moment.

Presence. Practice. Purpose.

Home.

Not the monitoring station where she spent forty-three years. Not Antarctica where she built identity. Not the past she can't change. Not the future she can't control.

Here. Lagos. Family. Now. Until now ends.

Home.

The flower will bloom.

For nine hundred days.

Then fall.

But the blooming—that's real. That's whole. That's complete.

Amara eats her curry. Listens to Kofi explain butterfly migration patterns. Watches Maya correct his taxonomy. Sees Zara's hand find Kwame's under the table. Feels David's presence beside her. Experiences this moment. This brief, insufficient, perfect moment.

The work is complete.

The living begins.

For nine hundred days.

That's enough.

That's everything.

That's home.
