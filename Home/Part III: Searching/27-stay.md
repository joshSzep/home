# Chapter 27: Stay

**Kenji Torres | Year 8, Month 8 | Lagos District**

---

The transport arrives at dawn.

Kenji stands in the arrival hall watching Lagos District wake through floor-to-ceiling windows. Engineered tropical climate—humid, bright, relentlessly alive. Fifth city. Third continent. Antarctica to Tokyo to Cairo to Mumbai to here. Always moving. Never arriving.

He's thirty years old. Feels older. Feels exhausted in ways sleep doesn't fix.

The arrival hall is mostly empty—few people travel anymore, fewer want to arrive anywhere. The ones who do are seekers like him, or mourners visiting family, or the hollowed-out ones who've given up on staying still. He sees himself in all of them. Different faces, same exhaustion. Same question behind their eyes: *Is there an answer somewhere? Did I miss it? Should I keep looking?*

Kenji doesn't know. Thought he'd know by now. Six years should have been enough to find something. But each city offered the same pattern: arrival, hope, study, practice, gradual realization that he's still himself, departure. Tokyo's Buddhism. Cairo's Stoicism. Mumbai's meditation. Different vocabularies for the same unbridgeable gap between understanding and being.

He's not going back to Antarctica. Can't. Not yet. Not empty-handed like this. His mother would understand—she always understands—but he wouldn't. Thirty years old. Six years seeking. Nothing to show for it except intellectual understanding of seventeen different wisdom traditions and complete inability to embody any of them.

Lagos is the last attempt. Has to be. He's running out of places to run.

The arrival district transitions into residential zones. Lagos District spreads in all directions—five million people, engineered green spaces between housing blocks, the managed chaos of a city that shouldn't exist but does anyway. Used to be ten million. Year 8 of the apocalypse thins everything. Seven years left, and people still living. Still building. Still trying. The persistence is remarkable. Or delusional. Or both.

Kenji has the address. Zara's apartment—his cousin, though they've never been close. Amara's younger sister. Family he barely knows. She's expecting him. Offered her guest room when he'd sent the message three weeks ago: *Coming to Lagos. Heard there's a teacher there. Professor Wei. Can you connect me?*

Zara's response: *Of course. But don't expect what you've found elsewhere. Wei doesn't teach. She just is. Come ready to unlearn.*

Unlearn. Another promise. Another framework. Kenji is so tired of frameworks.

But he's here. Nowhere else to go. Seven years until everyone dies. Might as well spend them seeking what can't be found.

---

Zara's building is mid-tier residential—fifty units arranged around a central courtyard. Green everywhere—balcony gardens, rooftop cultivation, plants erupting from every available surface. The compound has that lived-in feeling: children's toys scattered in common areas, maintenance equipment left casually, the hum of community that comes from people actually living together instead of just proximally.

Zara meets him at her door. Forty-two years old now. Kenji last saw her at a family gathering twelve years ago—he was eighteen, she was thirty, they'd exchanged polite conversation about his studies. She looks different now. Older, obviously. But also: settled. Present. Like she's found something he's still seeking.

"Kenji." She hugs him. Real hug. "Welcome."

"Thank you for hosting me."

"Of course. Family." She steps back, studying him. "You look tired."

"Seven years traveling."

"Did you find what you were looking for?"

The question lands harder than she probably intended. "No."

"Good." Zara's smile is knowing. "Wei says the ones who haven't found anything yet are the only ones worth teaching."

Inside, the apartment is warm chaos. Children's drawings on walls. Engineering schematics on the kitchen table. Plants everywhere—balcony garden visible through the open door, some old woman in a wheelchair tending flowers with shaking hands. 

"That's Wei," Zara says, following his gaze. "She lives next door but spends mornings in my garden. Her own space is smaller. I'll introduce you after you've settled."

Kenji unpacks in the guest room. Doesn't take long—he stopped carrying much by Cairo. Clothes. His mother's letters. The journal where he documents all the seeking that leads nowhere. That's it. Everything else he's learned to leave behind.

Through the window he can see the old woman in the wheelchair. She's watering a lemon tree, movements careful despite the shaking. Something about her presence. Not seeking. Not striving. Just: being. Here. Doing what needs doing.

He's seen teachers before. Studied with masters. Attended ashrams and monasteries and philosophy communes. All of them wise. All of them present in ways he couldn't reach. This woman looks different. Or maybe he's just desperate enough to project difference onto another teacher who'll eventually prove as inaccessible as the rest.

---

He meets Wei at lunch.

Zara brings him to the balcony garden where the old woman sits in her wheelchair, bowl of soup balanced on a tray. Up close, Wei is ancient—118 years old, Zara said. Her face carries every one of those years. But her eyes are sharp, clear, seeing.

"Professor Wei, this is Kenji. My cousin from Antarctica. The one I mentioned."

Wei looks at him. Not assessing. Just: looking. Seeing. Kenji feels uncomfortably visible.

"You're the seeker," Wei says. Her voice is thin but steady.

"I suppose so."

"Sit."

Kenji sits on the garden bench. Zara excuses herself—some compound meeting about water systems. The balcony is quiet except for the sounds of Lagos District below. Distant voices. Transit hum. The ambient noise of five million people living.

"You're Elena's son," Wei says.

"You know my mother?"

"We correspond. Five years now. She's wise woman. Understands witness."

Kenji blinks. "My mother?"

"Surprised?"

"She's a politician. A governor. I wouldn't call her wise."

"Then you don't see her." Wei sips her soup carefully. Hands shaking but managing. "She shows up every day to work that accomplishes nothing. Maintains order when order is impossible. Witnesses collapse with dignity. That's wisdom. Different from seeking wisdom. Better, maybe."

The words sting. Kenji has spent six years seeking while his mother just... showed up. Daily. Doing her work. Being present. He'd thought of it as stubbornness. Denial. Not wisdom.

"You've been traveling," Wei continues. "Tokyo. Cairo. Mumbai. Now here. Looking for answer."

"How did you—"

"Your mother writes about you. Worries. Hopes. Grieves that you're searching when maybe you should be living." Wei sets down the soup. "Did you find answers in Tokyo?"

"Intellectually, yes. I learned—"

"I didn't ask what you learned. I asked if you found answers."

Kenji stops. Considers. "No."

"Cairo?"

"No."

"Mumbai?"

"No."

"So." Wei gestures at the garden. "Why Lagos?"

"Because I don't know where else to go."

"Ah. Now honest." Wei smiles slightly. "That's good start. The seeking itself is lie if you're running. But admitting you're running—that's closer to truth."

Kenji feels something crack in his chest. She's right. He's been running. From Antarctica. From the asteroid. From his own inability to transform. Dressed it up as seeking, as spiritual practice, as philosophical inquiry. But underneath: just running.

"I'm thirty years old," he says quietly. "I'll be thirty-seven when everyone dies. And I've spent six years—almost a quarter of my remaining life—looking for how to live these years meaningfully. But I can't find it. I understand impermanence intellectually. I can recite all ten stages. I know all the teachings. But I can't *feel* them. Can't embody them. There's this gap between knowing and being and I can't cross it."

Wei listens. Doesn't interrupt. Doesn't offer immediate wisdom. Just: listens.

"The Tokyo teacher said I was still on Picture One," Kenji continues. "Still just seeking. That was six years ago. I thought I'd progressed since then—maybe Picture Three now, glimpsing it. But glimpsing isn't catching. I see it clearly sometimes—understanding, presence, acceptance. But I can't hold it. And I'm tired. So tired. Of seeking. Of failing. Of being stuck in my own head watching myself fail to be present while analyzing why I can't be present which prevents me from being present which I analyze which—" He stops. "It's recursive. Infinite loop. And I can't break it."

"Good," Wei says.

Kenji looks up, startled. "Good?"

"You've arrived at useful despair. Not dramatic despair—'nothing matters, everything is meaningless.' Useful despair—'everything I'm doing isn't working.' That's different. That's readiness."

"Readiness for what?"

"For stopping."

The word sits there. Stopping. Not seeking different answer. Not trying harder. Not moving to another city. Just: stopping.

"I don't know how to stop," Kenji admits.

"Good. Not-knowing is start." Wei gestures to the lemon tree. "You see this tree?"

"Yes."

"Tell me about it."

Kenji looks at the tree. Fifty years old, maybe. Well-maintained. Healthy foliage. Some fruit developing. "It's a lemon tree. Citrus limon. Probably grown from seed, transplanted multiple times. Currently fruiting. Well cared for."

"That's analyzing. I asked you to tell me about it."

Kenji stops. Looks again. What is there to say that isn't analysis? "I... don't know what you're asking."

"Exactly." Wei nods. "You see tree through concepts. Classification, history, care requirements. All useful knowledge. All distance from actual tree. What if you just: see it? Without naming, categorizing, analyzing. Just: tree being tree. You being you. Both present. Both here."

Kenji tries. Looks at the tree. But immediately his mind engages: *This is presence practice. I'm trying to see without concepts. That's what the meditation teachers taught. Non-conceptual awareness. I should focus on direct perception. But this thinking about not-thinking is the problem. I need to—*

"You're thinking about trying to not think," Wei observes.

"Yes."

"That's okay. Mind does that. Just notice. Don't fight it. Notice and return. Tree. Here. Now. Not achieving anything. Just: looking."

He tries again. The tree stands. Leaves move slightly in manufactured breeze. Fruit hanging. Everything just: being itself. He feels something shift—a moment of actual seeing, without the cascade of thoughts. Then immediately: *That was it! I did it!* And it's gone. Back to thinking about the experience instead of having it.

"There," Wei says. "You touched it. Then grabbed at it. Grabbing pushed it away."

"So what do I do?"

"Keep practicing. Not practicing to achieve. Just: practicing. Water plants. Wash dishes. Sit in garden. Notice when mind wanders. Return gently. No force. No achievement. Just: returning. That's all practice is."

"For how long?"

"Until you stop asking how long." Wei picks up her soup bowl again. "You can stay. Guest room in Zara's apartment is yours as long as you need it. Come to garden every day. Help me water plants. We won't talk philosophy. Won't discuss theories. Just: tend garden together. That's teaching."

Kenji feels something he hasn't felt in six years. Not hope—hope is too strong. But: possibility. Not of finding answers. Of stopping seeking answers. Wei isn't offering wisdom. She's offering presence. Being here. Watering plants. No grand revelation. Just: this.

"I don't know how to be a student of gardening," Kenji says.

"Perfect. You're not qualified. Best students are unqualified—they don't bring preconceptions." Wei finishes her soup. "Tomorrow morning. Dawn. Meet me here. We'll water together. That's all. No teaching. No philosophy. Just: watering."

"That's enough?"

"That's everything."

---

That night, Kenji sits in the guest room writing to his mother. Six years of letters. She's kept every one. Reads them. Responds quarterly with her own letters—sparse, honest, maintaining connection across the distance.

*Mom,*

*Year 8, Month 8 from Lagos. I met Professor Wei today. The teacher you've been corresponding with. She's... different from the other teachers. Or maybe I'm different now. Too tired to perform seeking anymore. Too exhausted to pretend I'm making progress.*

*She said something that landed: you're wise because you show up every day to work that accomplishes nothing. I've been traveling six years seeking wisdom while you've been living it. Sitting in your empty briefings. Maintaining order when order is impossible. Witnessing with dignity. I called that denial. She calls it wisdom. She's right.*

*I don't know if I can learn what Wei teaches. Don't even know what she teaches. She doesn't offer frameworks. Just: be here. Water plants. Notice mind wandering. Return gently. That's all. After six years of complex philosophies and elaborate practices, it sounds too simple. Or maybe exactly simple enough.*

*I'm staying in Lagos. Not forever—nothing is forever. But for now. Going to stop seeking and start... being here. Trying to, anyway. The gap between trying and doing is the whole problem. But Wei says that's okay. The gap is practice.*

*I miss you. Miss home. Miss the simplicity of just living instead of seeking meaning in living. Maybe that's what I'm learning. Maybe that's Picture Four—catching the ox after six years of glimpsing. Maybe I'm still on Picture One. Don't know. Wei says the pictures aren't ladder to climb, just mirror to see where you are. So: here I am. Lagos. Exhausted. Beginning again. Or stopping again. Same thing, maybe.*

*Seven years left. I won't spend them all in Lagos. But I'll spend some time here. Learning to water plants. Learning to not-learn. Learning to stop trying to learn. Whatever that means.*

*Thank you for the correspondence with Wei. Thank you for showing up every day. Thank you for being wise in ways I didn't recognize. I see it now. Better late than never.*

*Your stopping-seeking son,*  
*Kenji*

He seals the letter. Tomorrow he'll send it. Tomorrow he'll meet Wei in the garden at dawn. Tomorrow he'll water plants and try to be present without trying. Tomorrow begins the practice of not-practicing. 

The recursive trap again. But Wei said that's okay. Just notice and return. The noticing itself is practice. Not achieving presence. Just noticing absence of presence and returning. Again. Again. Again. Until...

Until what? 

He doesn't know. For the first time in six years, that feels like permission instead of failure.

---

Dawn comes humid and bright.

Kenji finds Wei already in the garden, wheelchair positioned by the lemon tree. The watering can sits beside her, too heavy for her shaking hands to lift.

"Good morning, student," Wei says. "Ready to learn nothing?"

Kenji surprises himself by smiling. First real smile in months. Maybe years. "Yes."

"Pick up the watering can."

He does. It's heavy—full of water from the rain barrel.

"The lemon tree needs water. You see the soil?"

Kenji looks. The soil around the tree is dry, cracked. "Yes."

"Water it."

He waters slowly, watching the soil absorb. The water darkens the earth, seeps down, reaches roots. The tree doesn't move. Doesn't change visibly. Just: receives water. Being tree. Doing what trees do.

"Good," Wei says. "Now the gardenias."

He waters the gardenias. Then the herbs. Then the vegetables. Moving through the garden systematically, attending to what needs attending. His mind tries to make it significant—*This is meditation. This is practice. This is teaching.* But mostly it's just: watering. Plants need water. He provides water. Simple transaction. Simple presence.

"You're thinking," Wei observes.

"Yes. About whether I'm doing this right."

"Are the plants getting water?"

"Yes."

"Then you're doing it right." She shifts in her wheelchair. "Thinking happens. Mind does that. It's not the enemy. Just: notice thinking. Return to watering. Thought isn't obstacle. Attachment to thought is obstacle. Let thoughts be. Return to plants."

They sit in silence after the watering is complete. The morning is still cool. Lagos District waking below. Voices rising. Transit systems humming. The world continuing. Seven years left and people still watering plants. Still tending gardens. Still building, maintaining, caring. The persistence. The defiance. The simple choice to be present to what's here instead of absent to what's coming.

"Tomorrow morning," Wei says. "Same time. We'll water again."

"That's all?"

"That's everything."

Kenji nods. Stays sitting. The garden blooming around them. The lemon tree standing patient. The herbs spreading in their containers. Everything temporary. Everything here now. Everything worth tending.

He thinks about Picture Four: catching the ox. The boy grabs the rope, holds on, begins the work of taming. Still effort required. Still struggle. But contact made. The teaching caught, not just glimpsed.

Maybe this is it. Maybe watering plants with a shaking-handed old woman is catching the ox. Not dramatic. Not enlightenment. Just: contact. Presence. Being here without seeking to be somewhere else.

Or maybe he's still on Picture One and Wei is letting him think he's progressed. Doesn't matter. The pictures are mirror, not ladder. He's where he is. Here in this garden. Seven years until everyone dies. But right now: lemon tree watered. Gardenias tended. Work complete.

He'd imagined finding answers would feel profound. Earth-shattering. Revelatory. This feels different. Smaller. Simpler. More like permission than achievement. Permission to stop seeking. Permission to just be here. Water plants. Notice thinking. Return to presence. That's all.

That's enough.

That's everything.

"Stay," Wei says suddenly.

Kenji looks at her. "What?"

"I'm inviting you: stay. Not permanently—nothing is permanent. But stay for a while. Stop seeking answers and start living questions. Learn gardening. Practice presence. Be here." She meets his eyes. "Not because it will enlighten you. Not because it will fix you. Just: because you're tired and gardens are good place to rest."

Kenji feels tears threatening. Six years of seeking. Six years of teachers offering techniques and frameworks and elaborate solutions. Wei offering: rest. Garden. Staying.

"I don't know if I can," he says honestly.

"You've been running six years. Staying is harder than seeking. But you're ready. I can see it. Your useful despair. Your honest tiredness. Your admission that you don't know. All these are readiness."

"Readiness for what?"

"For beginning. Not beginning to achieve enlightenment. Beginning to be present. Different goal. Different practice. Same you, different relationship to you."

Kenji sits with this. The garden is quiet. Wei isn't pushing. Just: offering. Stay. Rest. Water plants. Learn nothing. Be here.

He thinks about Tokyo—seventeen months of zazen, still on Picture One. Cairo—fourteen months of philosophy, understanding everything and nothing. Mumbai—over four years of meditation, glimpsing occasionally, never catching. Seven years and here he is: exhausted, empty-handed, arriving at useful despair.

Wei said useful despair is readiness. Readiness to stop. Readiness to stay.

"Yes," Kenji says. The word comes from somewhere deeper than thought. "Yes, I'll stay."

Wei smiles—soft expression, genuine warmth. "Good. Welcome to the garden. Tomorrow we'll water again. Day after that: water again. Every day until you stop asking when wisdom arrives and just water because plants need water."

"How long will that take?"

"Wrong question." Wei's eyes twinkle slightly. "But asking wrong questions is also practice. Come. Tomorrow. Dawn. We'll start again."

Kenji helps Wei back inside—pushing the wheelchair carefully, noticing how frail her body is, how strong her presence. 118 years old. Seven years left maximum, probably less. Teaching until the end. Not because teaching achieves anything. Because teaching is being present to students. That's all. That's enough.

He returns to Zara's apartment. The guest room. His few belongings. Outside the window: the garden. The lemon tree. The space where he'll return tomorrow at dawn. Where he'll water plants. Where he'll notice his mind seeking and practice returning. Where he'll stay.

Not forever. Nothing is permanent. But for now. For these months or years remaining. For long enough to stop seeking and start being here. That's the practice. That's everything.

The ox-herding pictures call it catching the ox. Kenji calls it stopping. Wei calls it beginning. 

Same thing. Different words. All pointing at the same simple, impossible, necessary practice: be here. Water plants. Notice thinking. Return gently. Again. Again. Again.

Until returning becomes being. Until practice becomes life. Until the gap between understanding and embodiment—still there, probably always there—stops mattering because he's too busy watering plants to measure the gap.

Seven years left.

But right now: morning light through the window. Garden visible below. Wei's invitation accepted. The practice beginning.

Kenji sits on the guest room bed and feels, for the first time in six years, like maybe he can stop running.

Maybe staying is possible.

Maybe staying is everything.

Maybe he's finally ready to be here.

Home.
