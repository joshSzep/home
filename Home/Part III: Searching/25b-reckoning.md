# Chapter: Reckoning

**David Chen | Year 8, Month 8 | Lagos District**

---

The argument started over nothing. A dropped cup. Synth-coffee pooling across Zara's kitchen floor, and David reaching for a towel while Amara stood frozen, staring at the spreading stain like it meant something.

"It's just a cup," David said.

"I know it's just a cup."

But she didn't move. Didn't help. Just watched him clean, the same distant look he remembered from Year 4, from Year 3, from every moment when she retreated into calculation and left him alone in the marriage.

Seven months of trying. Seven months of weekly calls, two extended visits, careful hope. And now, in Zara's kitchen at 6 AM while everyone else slept, the old pattern rising like tide.

"Amara."

"What."

"Where are you right now?"

She blinked. Focused on him. The effort visible—pulling herself back from wherever she'd gone. "I'm here."

"Are you?"

The question hung between them. David wrung the towel over the sink. Brown water spiraling down the drain. He could feel the conversation waiting, the one they'd avoided for seven months. For four years of divorce. For the entire length of their marriage, if he was honest.

"We should talk," he said.

"We talk all the time."

"Not about this."

Amara's hands found the counter edge. Gripped. "About what?"

"About why the coffee cup made you disappear. About why you still do that. About—" He stopped. Started again. "About the seven years I spent married to your absence."

Silence. Morning light through Zara's kitchen window, Lagos waking outside, the compound stirring toward another day. Somewhere in the apartment, Kofi mumbled in his sleep. Life continuing around them while they stood at the edge of the conversation they'd never had.

"David—"

"I need to say this." His voice was quiet. Not angry. He'd burned through anger years ago. "I need to say it and I need you to hear it. Not calculate it. Hear it."

Amara nodded. Her face was pale. Scared. But she didn't run. Didn't retreat into her tablet or her data or the comfortable numbness that had protected her for a decade. She stayed.

David leaned against the counter. Looked at his hands. Maintenance hands. Twelve years of arrays and seals and the physical work of keeping systems running. He'd learned presence through maintenance. Maybe he could find words the same way—one piece at a time, methodical, patient.

"You left first," he said. "Before the divorce. Before the separation. You left me in Year 0, the night you detected the asteroid."

"I didn't—"

"You did." Not accusation. Just fact. "You went to the station that night and you never really came back. I was there, in our apartment, waiting for you to return. For four years. But you'd already chosen the numbers over me."

Amara's eyes were wet. She didn't wipe her face. Let the tears fall.

"I'm not saying you were wrong," David continued. "I'm not saying I was blameless. I retreated too. Into the arrays, into routine, into the same isolation you chose. We both ran. But Amara—" His voice caught. He waited. Continued. "—you ran first. And you never told me you were going."

"I didn't know how."

"I know."

"I didn't know how to feel it and still function. The numbers were—" She stopped. Breathed. "The numbers were the only thing I could control. If I let myself feel it, I would have broken. And I couldn't break. Someone had to calculate the trajectory updates, track the orbital decay, maintain the models. Someone had to—"

"Someone had to," David agreed. "But it didn't have to be you. There were other astronomers. Other stations. You chose it because it let you hide."

"Yes."

The admission cost her something. He could see it in how she gripped the counter, how her shoulders curved forward, how small she looked in Zara's kitchen seven thousand kilometers from the station where she'd hidden for a decade.

"And the divorce," he said. "I filed because you'd already left. But I should have fought harder. Should have—"

"No." Amara shook her head. "You shouldn't have. I wasn't there to fight for. You would have been fighting a ghost."

"I know. But I gave up too easily. Four years of waiting and then one conversation with a lawyer and it was done. Like twelve years of marriage could just—" He gestured at the stain on the floor. "—spill and get wiped away."

They stood in the quiet. The compound was waking now. Footsteps in the hallway outside. Someone's radio playing news. The ordinary sounds of people living, continuing, trying.

"What do you want?" Amara asked finally. "From this. From us. What are you actually asking for?"

David considered the question. What did he want? He'd thought about it for seven months. Longer. Since the morning he'd shown up at her door with breakfast and hope.

"I want to know if you're here," he said. "Really here. Not calculating. Not numb. Not performing recovery for my benefit. I want to know if you can stay in the room when it gets hard."

"I don't know if I can."

"That's honest."

"It's not good enough."

"It's a start." He stepped closer. Not touching. Just: present. In the same space. "I'm not asking you to be fixed, Amara. I'm asking you to be here. With me. Even when you want to run. Especially when you want to run."

"What if I run anyway?"

"Then I'll wait. Like I did before. But this time I'll know you're running, and I'll leave the door open."

Amara's laugh was broken, wet. "That's not fair to you."

"Probably not. But I'm not looking for fair. I'm looking for real. And real means: sometimes you'll disappear. Sometimes I'll disappear. But we'll come back. We'll try to come back. That's different from before."

"Is it?"

"Before, we didn't try. We just... dissolved. Stopped talking. Stopped showing up. Let the marriage end through neglect." He reached out, touched her hand. First deliberate touch since the transport to Lagos. "I don't want to neglect us again. Even if us is messy and broken and uncertain."

Amara turned her hand over. Held his. Her palm was cold, slightly damp with nervous sweat. Real. Alive. Here.

"I don't know how to be here," she said. "I've spent ten years learning how to be absent. How to calculate instead of feel. How to survive by not caring. I don't know how to reverse that."

"Neither do I. But I know how to maintain things. How to show up every day and do the small repairs. How to keep systems running through attention and patience." He squeezed her hand. "Maybe we learn together. Small repairs. Daily presence. Not trying to fix everything at once."

"Maintenance," Amara said. "You're suggesting we treat our relationship like a solar array."

"It's what I know."

She almost smiled. "That's very you."

"Is that bad?"

"No." The almost-smile became real. Small, fragile, but real. "It's actually comforting. Concrete. Something I can understand."

They stood together in Zara's kitchen, holding hands, the coffee stain drying on the floor. Outside, Lagos brightened toward full morning. In an hour, Zara would wake. Maya would ask difficult questions about astrophysics. Kofi would demand attention and gardens and the full chaos of family life.

But right now: just the two of them. Holding what they'd said. Holding what they hadn't solved but had finally named.

"I'm sorry," Amara said.

"For what?"

"For leaving first. For the seven years of marriage where I was already gone. For the seven years after where I hid in numbers. For—" Her voice broke. "—for everything I couldn't give you because I was too scared to feel."

David pulled her into his arms. She was stiff for a moment, unused to being held. Then she softened. Leaned into him. Let herself be held.

"I'm sorry too," he said into her hair. "For giving up. For not fighting harder. For letting the maintenance routine become another way to hide. We were both scared. We both ran."

"But we're here now."

"We're here now."

They held each other while the sun rose higher and the compound fully woke. Footsteps in the hall. Doors opening and closing. The sounds of life continuing despite everything.

"I want to try," Amara said against his chest. "Really try. Not just survive together. Not just tolerate each other because it's easier than being alone. I want—" She pulled back, looked at him. "I want to be present. With you. For whatever time we have."

"Seven years."

"Seven years. Maybe less. Maybe more. Does it matter?"

"No," David said. "It never mattered. We thought we had fifty years when we got married. We were wrong. Now we know we have seven. The amount doesn't change what we do with it."

"Be present."

"Be present. Show up. Do the maintenance. Come back when we run."

Amara reached up, touched his face. Her hand still cold, still slightly trembling. But here. Intentionally here.

"I love you," she said. "I should have said it more often. I should have—"

"You're saying it now."

"It's not enough."

"It's a start."

She kissed him. First real kiss in four years, five months, seven days—not that David was counting. Soft and tentative and terrified and brave. He kissed her back, tasting coffee and salt tears and the particular taste of someone who was trying, really trying, to be present.

When they separated, Amara was crying again. Smiling through the tears. "That was unexpected."

"Good unexpected?"

"Yes. Good unexpected."

Footsteps in the hall. A door opening. Kofi's voice calling for breakfast. The domestic machine starting up. Their private moment ending.

But not gone. Held. Something had shifted in Zara's kitchen, something that wouldn't unshift. They'd named the absence. Named the fear. Named the choice to try anyway.

It wasn't resolution. The problems were still there—her tendency to disappear, his tendency to wait too long, the years of damage and distance between them. But it was beginning. Real beginning. Not just hope but intention.

"We should clean this up," David said, nodding at the dried coffee stain.

"We should."

They cleaned it together. Simple domestic act. Maintenance. Presence. And when Kofi burst into the kitchen demanding breakfast, they were standing side by side at the counter, making synth-eggs, looking like what they were trying to become:

Two people. Choosing to be here. Together.

---

That evening, after the children were asleep and Zara had retreated to her room, David and Amara sat on the compound roof. The Lagos skyline spread around them. Two hundred million people. Six years remaining.

"Tell me about the arrays," Amara said.

So he told her. Platform 73. 47B. The 12,000 shifts that had taught him presence. The seals and housings and the small satisfactions of systems maintained. He talked for an hour, maybe more. Not performing. Just sharing. The way he should have shared during their marriage. The way she should have asked.

When he finished, Amara was quiet for a long moment.

"I envied you," she said finally. "That sounds wrong. But I did. You found something real. Work that mattered. A purpose that wasn't about the asteroid. I never found that. The calculations were just—" She waved her hand. "—elaborated despair. Different way of hiding."

"What do you want to do? If not the station?"

"I don't know." She looked at the stars. Somewhere up there, the asteroid continued its approach. She'd spent a decade tracking it. Now it just: was. Inevitable. Beyond calculation. "Maybe teach Maya. She wants to learn orbital mechanics. Maybe—" She stopped. "—maybe just be here. With you. With Zara. With the children. Stop solving and start witnessing."

"That sounds like something Wei would say."

"She's been writing to me. Years of letters I barely acknowledged. But the last few months, I've been reading them. Really reading them." Amara leaned against him. "She told me that presence isn't about fixing anything. It's about being conscious while things unfold. Witnessing without trying to control."

"Hard for someone who calculates trajectories."

"Impossible for someone who calculates trajectories. But—" She gestured at Lagos, at the sky, at everything. "—the trajectory is calculated. It's done. I can't change it. The only thing left is how I witness the time remaining."

"With me?"

"With you. With everyone. But especially with you."

David put his arm around her. She leaned into him. They sat on the roof of Zara's compound, looking at the Lagos night, and for the first time in ten years, neither of them was hiding.

The problems weren't solved. The distance wasn't bridged. The years of damage weren't healed. But they were present. Conscious. Choosing to be here.

Small maintenance. Daily presence. The beginning of repair.

It would have to be enough.

It was enough.
