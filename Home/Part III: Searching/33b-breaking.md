# Chapter: Breaking

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 11, Month 9, Day 3 | Lagos District**

---

She holds it together until the bathroom door closes.

Three days since Wei died. Three days of managing everything—the funeral arrangements, Ling's grief, the children's confusion, Amara's distance, the neighbors who kept arriving with food. Three days of being the one who answers questions. The one who knows what to do next. The one who doesn't fall apart.

The bathroom is small. Tile floor, cement walls, the condensation of Lagos humidity on every surface. Zara turns on the shower—hot, loud, steam rising—and then she breaks.

The sound that comes out of her is barely human. A wail she's been holding in her chest for three days, maybe longer. Maybe fifteen years. Since the morning Maya woke her with a fever and she burst onto Wei's balcony and everything changed. Fifteen years of being the steady one. The strong one. The one who keeps everyone else upright.

She sinks to the floor. The tiles are cool against her legs, her back. Water runs hot above her, steam filling the room, and she lets herself cry in a way she hasn't since before detection. Ugly crying. Messy crying. The kind of crying that happens when you stop performing.

Wei is gone.

This should be acceptable. Wei was 125 years old. She'd been dying for months. She chose to die present, chose to teach through her ending, chose to show everyone what a good death looks like. It was peaceful. Beautiful, even. The flower bloomed.

And still Zara is breaking.

---

The steam rises. The water roars. The children can't hear her through the sound. This is why she chose the bathroom. Calculated, even in grief—find a place to fall apart where no one will witness.

But she needs to fall apart. Needs this. Has needed it for years but never let herself.

Fifteen years since detection. Maya was two. Zara was thirty-three. She burst onto Wei's balcony because she didn't know what else to do with a child who would die at seventeen. She cried then—once—and Wei held her while Maya climbed flowers. Then Zara stopped crying. Started managing. Started building the systems that would keep her family alive for as long as possible.

She designed water systems for the compound. Organized food distribution when supplies became erratic. Coordinated with neighbors, built community, maintained routines. When Kofi was born, she integrated him into the structure. When Kwame struggled, she supported him. When Amara vanished into numbness, Zara kept showing up anyway. When Wei needed care, Zara provided it.

Who provided for Zara?

The question surfaces and she can't answer it. No one, maybe. Or everyone, in fragments. Wei's teaching helped. Kwame's steadiness helped. The children's need for her helped. But the core of it—the terror, the grief, the impossible weight of loving people who will die—she's carried that alone.

And now Wei is gone.

The one person who understood. The one person who didn't need Zara to be strong. The one person who could hold space for Zara's fear without flinching.

Zara lets herself howl.

---

The water runs cold. She doesn't know how long she's been on the floor. Ten minutes. An hour. Time does strange things when you're broken open.

She stands slowly. Legs stiff. Heart empty. Face swollen with crying. She looks at herself in the mirror—fog-covered, distorted—and doesn't recognize the woman looking back. Who is this person when she's not managing something?

*Just this*, Wei used to say. *Just what arises. Just what's here.*

What's here is: grief. What's here is: exhaustion. What's here is: four more years until everyone she loves dies and she can't stop it.

Zara presses her forehead against the cool glass. Breathes. The Buddhist breathing Wei taught her. In for four. Hold for four. Out for four. Hold for four. Repeat.

The breath doesn't make the grief smaller. It just makes the breath possible.

She emerges from the bathroom. Face washed, hair wet, wearing clean clothes from the basket. The apartment is quiet. Kwame took the children to the park—another management decision, giving Zara space to "rest." He knows. He always knows. But he doesn't push.

Ling is in the kitchen, making tea. Wei's caregiver for twenty years, now without purpose. She looks up when Zara enters. Their eyes meet. Something passes between them—recognition. Ling knows what the bathroom was for.

"Tea," Ling says simply. Not a question.

"Thank you."

They sit at Wei's table. The table where Wei ate, taught, practiced presence. Now just: a table. Wood and memory.

"You've been holding it," Ling says.

"Someone had to."

"Did they?"

Zara considers. Did they? Would the funeral not have happened if she'd collapsed? Would the children have been harmed by seeing their mother grieve? Would the world have ended faster if she'd let herself break earlier?

"I don't know how to not hold it."

"No one asks you to stop. Just—" Ling pauses. "Also let it hold you. Sometimes."

Wei's teaching in Ling's voice. Of course. Twenty years of caring for Wei, Ling absorbed the practice by osmosis. Maybe that's how teaching works. Not instruction. Transmission.

"I'm scared," Zara admits. First time she's said it out loud in years.

"Of?"

"Everything. The end. Watching Maya die. Watching Kofi die. Watching Kwame die. Being conscious while everyone I love disappears." The words pour out. "I know the practice. I know impermanence. I know that everything ends. But knowing isn't the same as—" She stops. Breathes. "Knowing isn't enough."

"Knowing is never enough. Wei knew that. She practiced for seventy years and still had to practice every day. Practice isn't about knowing. It's about: doing. Returning. Showing up again."

"What if I can't?"

Ling meets her eyes. "Then you rest. And tomorrow you try again. And if you can't tomorrow, you rest tomorrow. And then you try the day after. Until trying becomes possible again."

---

Evening. The children return.

Maya is quiet, internal—three days into her own processing of Wei's death. Kofi is restless, hungry, complaining about the heat. Kwame moves through the apartment with careful attention, checking on everyone without asking direct questions.

Zara watches them from the couch. Her family. Four years from dying. Every moment with them is borrowed time, but borrowed time is still time.

Kofi flops next to her. "Mama, I'm hungry."

"Papa's making dinner."

"But I'm hungry *now*."

She reaches out, pulls him close. He's nearly eleven—too old for this, he'd usually say—but he lets her. Leans into her warmth. Smells like sweat and Lagos dust and childhood.

"I love you," Zara says.

"I love you too." He looks up at her. Something in her face makes him pause. "Are you okay?"

Is she okay? No. She'll never be okay. Her son will die at fourteen. Her daughter will die at seventeen. Everyone she loves will burn.

But right now: he's here. Warm against her. Alive.

"I'm sad about Professor Wei," she says. Honest. Simple. What children need.

"Me too." Kofi nestles closer. "I miss her."

"I know. I miss her too."

They sit together. Maya drifts in, takes the other side of the couch. Doesn't speak. Just: present. Kwame hums in the kitchen—an Akan song his mother used to sing. The apartment fills with ordinary sounds. Cooking. Breathing. Being alive.

Zara holds her children and lets herself feel all of it. The love and the grief. The presence and the loss. The impossibility of raising children toward death. The gift of raising children at all.

Wei died three days ago. The world goes on. Zara breaks and Zara holds. Both true. Both necessary.

---

Night. Kwame asleep beside her.

Zara lies awake, staring at the ceiling. The crying is done. The breaking is done. What's left is the ordinary work of continuing.

Tomorrow she'll check the water systems. Make sure the compound has what it needs. Talk to the neighbors about the memorial garden they want to plant in Wei's honor. Continue being the one who manages things, because that's who she is, and being who you are isn't wrong even when it's exhausting.

But tonight she let herself break. And tomorrow, she'll let herself break again if she needs to. And the day after. Ling was right. Practice isn't about perfection. It's about returning.

Wei's voice in memory: *The flower blooms. The flower wilts. Both are the flower.*

Zara bloomed today. Zara wilted today. Both are Zara.

She closes her eyes. Lets sleep take her.

Four more years. Fourteen hundred and sixty days.

Enough time to practice. Enough time to break and return. Enough time to love everyone she's going to lose.

She sleeps.
