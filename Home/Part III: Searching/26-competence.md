# Chapter 26: Competence

**Ibrahim al-Rashid | Year 8, Month 5 | Antarctic Solar Arrays**

---

Platform 73. Morning light breaking pale across the ice. Ibrahim clips his harness at 6:51 AM—one minute late, which is early enough. Fourteen months of this routine. Nearly five years since arrival as wounded refugee in Year 3, but only fourteen months since he started this job. Fourteen months of maintenance work that seemed pointless at first and now seems... less pointless. Maybe.

"Morning." He nods to David Chen, already inspecting connection housing at the platform's edge.

"Morning, Ibrahim." David doesn't look up. Focused. Present. Always present in the way Ibrahim is learning to be.

They work in comfortable silence. This is what fourteen months builds—not deep friendship exactly, but partnership. Understanding without too many words. Two men maintaining solar arrays that will vaporize in seven years. Not discussing why. Just doing.

Ibrahim's leg aches. Always aches. The limp is permanent—shrapnel damage from Year 2, two surgeries, chronic pain manageable but constant. He moves slower than David. Compensates with care. Used to hate the limitation. Now: just incorporates it. Right leg weak, left leg strong, cane when needed, careful placement on the metal grating. Physics of damaged body. Accommodation instead of rage.

When did that change?

The thought surfaces unbidden. Ibrahim pauses mid-motion, diagnostic tablet in hand. When did he stop hating the limp? When did the morning climb stop feeling like punishment? When did showing up to maintain arrays stop being just... passing time until death?

He doesn't know. The shift was gradual. Invisible. Five years in Antarctica—most of them spent drifting, aimless, wanting to die but lacking energy for suicide. Then Year 7, this job. Fourteen months of routine slowly becoming fourteen months of practice.

"Housing integrity at seventy-six percent," David reports. "Standard degradation. Should take forty minutes."

"I'll prep the replacement seals."

Ibrahim moves to the equipment locker. His hands know the sequence. Fourteen months of repetition built this competence. He pulls the seal kit, checks the specifications, confirms the part numbers. Automatic. Easy. *Competent*.

The word lands with unexpected weight. Ibrahim is competent at this. Not just functional or adequate—actually skilled. He's learned. Developed expertise. Can diagnose housing failures by sound now. Knows which platforms degrade fastest. Anticipates David's needs before he asks.

When did that happen? Year 3 through Year 6: nothing. Unemployment, aimless walks, counting stairs obsessively, wanting death. Then Year 7: this job. And somehow, in fourteen months, competence emerged.

Robot 47B glides over on its treads, sensors focusing on Ibrahim. *Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague al-Rashid. Assistance required?"

"No. Just getting the seals." Ibrahim speaks to the robot naturally now. Used to feel absurd—conversing with machines. But 47B is consistent. Reliable. Treats him as colleague without judgment or pity or awkwardness about the limp, the lost faith, the broken history.

"Acknowledged. Weather conditions optimal for repairs. Probability of completion within projected timeframe: ninety-one percent."

"Good odds."

*Beep beep.* "Colleague al-Rashid displays appropriate optimism. This correlates with improved work efficiency over past ten months."

Ibrahim almost smiles. The robot tracks everything. Including his gradual shift from going through motions to being present to the work. Ten months ago—Year 7, Month 7. What happened then? He can't remember specific moment. Just: the numbness thinning. The automaticity becoming attention. After four years of unemployment and drift, suddenly this job held his attention.

He carries the seal kit back to David, who's already extracted the old housing. They work together—David cleaning the channels, Ibrahim preparing the new components, both moving in synchronized rhythm. This is partnership. Built through repetition. Through showing up daily for fourteen months. Through shared purpose, even if neither articulates what that purpose is. Still new. Still forming. But real.

The repair proceeds smoothly. Extract. Clean. Inspect. Install. Verify. Simple work. Maintenance work. The kind of work that doesn't matter for the future because there is no future. But matters for now. Present-moment function. Power flowing to the megacity below. Two billion people needing electricity to live seven more years.

That matters. Doesn't it?

Ibrahim tightens the final connection. David runs the diagnostic. Green across the board. Housing integrity back to ninety-three percent. Good for another eight months. Eight months that will exist whether they did this repair or not, but will exist *better* because they did.

"Well done," David says.

Not "good work" or "adequate" or "acceptable." *Well done*. Recognition. Respect.

Ibrahim feels something shift in his chest. Not quite pride. Not quite satisfaction. Something quieter. Acknowledgment that he did this competently. That his presence mattered. That showing up for fourteen months built skill, built partnership, built something real even if temporary.

"You've learned well," David adds, stowing the tools. "Remember your first week? You didn't know connection housing from voltage regulator."

"I remember." Ibrahim's voice is quiet. "I took the job because I'd spent four years doing nothing. Wandering. Counting stairs. Waiting to die. Then employment services contacted me. Said I qualified for technical training. I said yes because why not. Didn't care about learning. Just... existing."

"And now?"

Ibrahim considers. They're standing two hundred meters above Antarctica, surrounded by solar arrays stretching to the horizon, maintaining systems that will end but haven't ended yet. What is he doing now? Just existing still? Or something more?

"Now I care," he admits. Surprising himself with the truth. "About doing it right. About the repairs holding. About..." He trails off, uncertain. "Four years I didn't care about anything. Then this job. And caring came back. Slowly. Without me noticing."

"About showing up," David finishes.

"Yes. Showing up."

They stand in silence. The sun climbs higher, weak but present. The arrays hum their endless electric song. Below, the megacity sprawls—monument to humanity's persistence or stubbornness or simple refusal to stop existing just because existence ends.

"Why do you do this?" Ibrahim asks. The question he's been holding for months. "Really. Not the official answer. The true answer. Why maintain arrays that will vaporize in seven years?"

David is quiet for a long moment. Choosing words. Or deciding whether to answer honestly.

"Because I can," he says finally. "Because it matters while it matters. Because showing up is enough." He looks at Ibrahim directly. "Is showing up enough?"

"For you?"

"Yes. For you?"

Ibrahim doesn't know yet. The question hangs in the cold air. *Is showing up enough?* Is simple presence, simple competence, simple continuation sufficient? Without faith directing it? Without grand purpose explaining it? Without certainty that it leads somewhere meaningful?

Ibrahim doesn't have the answer. Just the question. And the fact that he's here, asking it, after four years of numbness and drift, now fourteen months of routine slowly transforming into... this. Whatever this is. Presence without faith. Purpose without permanence. Meaning-making through maintenance.

"I don't know," Ibrahim admits. "But I'm here. That's more than I expected a year ago. More than I thought possible four years ago."

"That's something."

"Is it enough?"

"That's for you to decide."

---

They break for lunch at noon. Sit on platform seventy-three with legs dangling over the edge, safety harnesses clipped. David unpacks his usual—protein bar, thermos of tea. Ibrahim has the cafeteria meal—synthesized protein, nutrient grain, engineered vegetables that taste almost right.

They eat in silence. But it's not the empty silence of Year 3, when Ibrahim first arrived broken and faithless and wanted to die but lacked the energy for suicide. Not the numb silence of Years 4 through 6, when he'd wander the city aimlessly, unemployed, existing only through inertia. This is comfortable silence. Companionable. Two people sharing space without needing to fill it.

The megacity spreads below. From this height, the patterns are visible—residential blocks, commercial districts, the green corridors of oxygen generation. Engineering triumph. Four billion people housed on frozen continent because everywhere else became unlivable. Now: two billion. The population bleeding away. Some dying, some disappearing, some just... leaving. For where? Nowhere better. Just: elsewhere. Movement as meaning substitute.

Ibrahim stayed. Fifty-three steps to his apartment on the fourth floor. Building 12, Unit 403. Same place nearly five years. Small. Sparse. His. The steps used to be obsessive counting—penance, meditation substitute, the only structure in structureless days. Now: just steps. Still counts them sometimes. Habit. But not compulsion. The ritual lost its grip sometime after he started working. After he had somewhere to go in the mornings.

When did that change?

"The population's down again," David observes, following Ibrahim's gaze. "Saw the statistics yesterday. One point nine billion in Antarctica now."

"People leaving?"

"People dying. Suicide rate's up twelve percent this quarter. Passive deaths—people just... stopping. Not eating. Not treating illness. Choosing to end early instead of waiting."

Ibrahim understands. He nearly chose that. Years 3 through 6, especially. The numbness was complete. Death would have been easier than continuing. He stayed alive through inertia more than choice. Existed because dying required effort he didn't have. Spent four years wandering the city, counting stairs, drinking tea with Min-seo, attending Fatima's dinners, walking with Derek in silence. Small human connections that kept him breathing without giving him reason to breathe.

"You ever think about it?" Ibrahim asks. "Ending early?"

David considers. Honest consideration, not polite deflection. "Yes. Year 1 through Year 3, especially. When the work felt pointless. When my marriage was dying. When every day was just... waiting for the asteroid." He sips his tea. "But I kept showing up. And somewhere along the way, showing up became enough."

"What changed?"

"I don't know. Understanding, maybe. That purpose doesn't require permanence. That meaning isn't about outcomes. That maintenance is meditation." He smiles slightly. "That sounds pretentious. But it's true."

"Maintenance as meditation," Ibrahim repeats. Testing the phrase. "I've heard that. From some of the other workers. Wei's teaching?"

"Filtered through many people, yes. The philosopher in Lagos. She's—she was—" David pauses. "She died last year. Natural death. Taught that presence is enough. That showing up matters even when nothing lasts."

Ibrahim absorbs this. He's heard Wei's name. The teaching circles that meet in the community centers. Ibrahim hasn't attended. Skeptical of philosophy, of answers, of anyone claiming to know how to face extinction with grace. But David embodies something of it. Shows up daily. Maintains systems with care. Finds meaning in process rather than outcome.

"You believe that?" Ibrahim asks. "That showing up is enough?"

"I'm starting to," David says. "Not because I've figured it out. Because I've practiced it. Ten years really, since detection. At some point the practice becomes the point."

Ibrahim turns this over. Practice as point. Process as purpose. He's been doing this unknowingly—not for five years. Not even for fourteen months really. But in the gap between Year 6's aimless drift and Year 8's competence, something shifted. The routine slowly hollowing out his emptiness. Or—no, not hollowing. Filling. Replacing the absence of faith with presence of action.

"I used to pray," Ibrahim says suddenly. Surprising himself. He doesn't talk about faith. Hasn't talked about it since leaving the militia. "Five times daily. Every day from age seven to nineteen. The structure held my life. Morning prayer, midday, afternoon, sunset, night. Everything organized around submission to Allah."

David listens. Doesn't interrupt.

"When I lost faith—when the asteroid made faith impossible—I lost the structure. Lost the reason for anything. Spent four years empty. Aimless. Counting stairs obsessively because I had nothing else to count. Then employment services offered training. I said yes without caring. Started this work. And slowly..." He trails off, searching for words. "The maintenance became structure. Morning shift. Lunch on the platform. Afternoon repairs. Evening routine. Not prayer. But rhythm. Not faith. But practice."

"Secular ritual," David suggests.

"Maybe." Ibrahim watches a transport shuttle cross the sky below them. "I still carry my prayer beads. Ninety-nine beads. Haven't used them in years. Can't throw them away. But can't pray with them either."

"Maybe you don't need to choose. Maybe they can just be reminder. That ritual matters. That practice matters. Even if the theology is gone."

Ibrahim's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket, where the *misbaha* rests. Small weight. Familiar. He's carried these beads for twenty years. They were connection to God. Now: connection to past self. To discipline. To the understanding that structure provides meaning even without divine mandate.

"You think showing up is enough," Ibrahim says slowly. "Without God watching. Without paradise waiting. Without any reason except... showing up itself."

"I think so. But I'm still figuring it out." David finishes his tea. "You don't have to believe it. Just have to do it. See what grows."

---

Afternoon shift. Platforms forty-one through sixty. Routine inspection. Most require nothing—just visual confirmation that automation is functioning. But platform forty-seven has a warning light. Voltage regulator misalignment.

"I can take this one," Ibrahim offers.

David glances at him. Slight surprise. Usually Ibrahim follows David's lead. This is initiative. Choice.

"Go ahead. I'll do the visual inspections. Meet you at platform fifty-five?"

"Agreed."

Ibrahim works alone. Approaches the voltage regulator with diagnostic tablet. Runs the scan. Identifies the issue—tracking drift, standard degradation. He's seen this failure mode thirty times. Knows the fix.

He performs it methodically. Realignment protocol. Verification sequence. Testing under load. The work takes twenty minutes. His hands move confidently. No hesitation. No second-guessing. He's done this enough times to trust his competence.

The diagnostic returns green. Regulator functioning within optimal parameters. Ibrahim logs the repair. Updates the maintenance schedule. Professional. Complete.

He stands alone on platform forty-seven, two hundred meters above the ice, having completed a repair independently. Competently. Successfully.

This is skill. This is expertise. This is fourteen months of showing up transformed into capability. After four years of nothing, suddenly: this.

Ibrahim feels something unfamiliar. Not pride exactly. Not joy. Something quieter. *Satisfaction*. The simple satisfaction of doing work well. Of having skill. Of contributing function to systems that power two billion lives for seven more years.

Is that enough?

He doesn't know. But it's more than nothing. More than the emptiness of Year 3. More than the aimless drift of Years 4 through 6. More than the despair of Jerusalem. More than the brokenness of losing faith.

It's something. Small something. Real something. Fragile still. New.

Maybe enough.

---

The shift ends at 4:47 PM. David and Ibrahim ride the platform elevator down together. Two hundred meters of descent. The city rising to meet them.

"Good work today," David says. "The platform forty-seven repair was solid."

"Thank you."

"Same time tomorrow?"

"Yes."

They separate at the transport station. David toward residential district. Ibrahim toward his building. Different directions. Parallel lives intersecting at work.

The walk home is familiar. Twenty minutes through the city. Building 12 visible from three blocks away. Standard refugee housing. His home for nearly five years.

He enters the building. Faces the stairwell. Fifty-three steps to the fourth floor. Ibrahim grips the handrail. Begins climbing.

One. Two. Three. His leg protests—always protests at day's end, fatigue making the limp more pronounced. Four. Five. Six. But the climbing is automatic now. Body knowing the rhythm.

He realizes halfway up: he's not counting obsessively. Not measuring each step against yesterday's pain. Not using the count as meditation substitute or distraction technique—the way he did for four years when stairs were the only structure he had. Just... climbing. Being present to the movement without making it ritual.

When did that change?

He doesn't know. Somewhere in the fourteen months since starting work. Somewhere in the transition from aimless to occupied. The compulsive counting faded. The steps became just steps.

First landing. Second flight. His breath steady. The pain manageable. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Second landing. Third flight. Thirty-eight. Thirty-nine.

A child passes him going down—maybe six years old, racing ahead of her mother. She glances at Ibrahim's limp. Doesn't stare. Just: acknowledges difference and continues. The mother nods greeting. Ibrahim nods back.

Normal interaction. Simple moment. He's part of the building's ecosystem. Not broken refugee hiding in apartment. Not former warrior pretending to be civilian. Just: resident. Colleague. Person.

Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

Fourth floor.

He unlocks Unit 403. Enters. Closes the door behind him.

The apartment is exactly as he left it. Small bedroom, kitchenette, bathroom, single window. Furnished minimally. Clean. Maintained. His space. Not temporary anymore. Not exile. Just: home.

Ibrahim sets down his work tablet. Removes his boots. Moves to the kitchenette and prepares tea. The kettle is basic, municipal-issue. The tea is cafeteria-grade. But it's his. His routine. His choice.

He sits at the small table with his tea. Looks out the window at the city stretching toward darkness. Millions of lights. Billions of people. All temporary. All continuing.

His prayer beads rest on the shelf beside the window. Ninety-nine beads on worn string. He hasn't touched them in months. Hasn't prayed in years. The faith is gone—not hiding, not dormant, but actually gone. That loss used to feel like amputation. Now: just absence. Space where faith was, now occupied by... what? Routine. Practice. Presence. Not replacement. Just: something else.

Ibrahim picks up the beads. Holds them. Feels the familiar weight.

*Ar-Rahman. Ar-Rahim. Al-Malik.*

The names surface automatically. Muscle memory from childhood. The Compassionate. The Merciful. The King. He could recite all ninety-nine without thinking. Has recited them thousands of times.

But the names don't connect to anything now. No presence listening. No deity responding. Just: words. Beautiful words. Meaningful once. Now: historical artifact. Personal history.

He sets the beads back on the shelf. Not throwing them away. Not using them either. Just: letting them exist. Reminder of who he was. Acknowledgment that faith mattered once even if it doesn't matter now.

Maybe that's okay. Maybe losing faith doesn't require destroying evidence of faith. Maybe prayer beads can sit on shelf unused, testament to sincerity that ran its course.

Ibrahim returns to his tea. His leg throbs—evening flare, usual. He'll take medication soon. Maybe soak in the bath if the building's hot water is functioning. Tomorrow: wake at 5:45 AM. Breakfast. Transport to the arrays. Clip harness at 6:51 AM. Work with David. Maintain platforms. Lunch at two hundred meters. Afternoon repairs. Home. Fifty-three steps. Tea. Sleep. Repeat.

Seven years left. Maybe he'll find something bigger. Some grand purpose to replace lost faith. Some community to belong to. Some answer to the question: why continue?

Maybe not.

Maybe this small peace is enough. Showing up. Being competent. Maintaining systems. Climbing fifty-three steps. Drinking tea. Being alive without wanting to die.

Not healed. Not happy. But: present. Real. Here.

That's progress. Fourteen months of progress. After four years of nothing. Invisible daily. Visible in accumulation.

Ibrahim finishes his tea. Washes the cup. Prepares for sleep. Tomorrow will be the same as today. And the day after. Routine without revelation. Practice without epiphany.

Maybe that's the point. Maybe presence doesn't require dramatic transformation. Maybe healing happens through repetition. Maybe purpose emerges from showing up even when you don't believe showing up matters.

He's here. Has been in Antarctica nearly five years—most of them empty, the last fourteen months building toward something. Will be here seven more years if the asteroid stays on schedule and his body holds and nothing intervenes.

That's something. Small something. Real something. New something.

Maybe enough.

The next morning: 5:45 AM. Alarm. Shower. Breakfast of protein paste and synthesized grain. Transport to Sector 7. The sun is rising—pale, weak, but present. Antarctica in Year 8 is quieter than Year 3. Less populated. Less chaotic. The initial panic has settled into chronic despair punctuated by moments of functioning.

Ibrahim functions. That's his contribution. Maintenance. Presence. Showing up.

Platform 73. He clips his harness at 6:51 AM. David is already there, checking the morning schedule on his tablet.

"Morning."

"Morning, Ibrahim." David looks up. "Platform nineteen needs attention. Connection housing. Interested in leading the repair?"

Leading. Not assisting. Not following. *Leading*.

"Yes," Ibrahim says. "I can do that."

They move to platform nineteen. Ibrahim runs the diagnostic himself. Identifies the degradation. Pulls the necessary tools. David watches but doesn't intervene. Trusting.

Ibrahim performs the repair. Extract the housing. Inspect the damage. Clean the surfaces. Install new seals. Verify integrity. Test under load. The work takes forty-five minutes. His hands are confident. His assessment accurate. The repair holds.

"Good work," David says. Simple acknowledgment. Colleague to colleague.

Robot 47B glides over. *Beep beep.* "Colleague al-Rashid efficiency rating: optimal. Repair quality: ninety-four percent. Projected maintenance interval: eight months."

"Thank you, 47B."

*Beep beep.* "Gratitude acknowledged. You are welcome, Colleague al-Rashid."

Ibrahim almost smiles. Optimal. Ninety-four percent. Eight months. Numbers providing validation. Proof that showing up for fourteen months built something real. After four years of nothing, suddenly: competence. Skill. Contribution. Not faith. Not certainty. Not grand purpose. Just: this.

Is that enough?

He still doesn't know. But he's here. Working. Present. Real.

That's start.

Maybe everything.

They continue to the next platform. The morning passes. Repairs completed. Lunch at two hundred meters. Afternoon inspections. The day unfolds in familiar rhythm.

Ibrahim is present to it. Not thinking constantly about the past—the militia, the faith, the failure. Not obsessing about the future—seven years, then death, then nothing. Just: here. This platform. This repair. This moment.

Presence without permanence. Purpose without destination. Meaning in showing up itself.

He's learning this. Slowly. Invisibly. Five years of routine transforming into five years of practice transforming into... this. Whatever this is. Small peace. Quiet competence. The absence of wanting to die replaced by simple presence of being alive.

Not healed. Not happy. Not whole.

But here.

That's enough.

Has to be enough.

Is enough.

For now.

Seven years left. Tomorrow he'll wake at 5:45 AM. Climb onto platform seventy-three. Work with David. Maintain arrays. Show up.

Because showing up matters. Even without faith directing it. Even without knowing why. Even without certainty that it leads anywhere.

Showing up is enough.

Ibrahim is starting to believe that.

Not as theology. As practice.

Not as answer. As question he can live with.

Seven years left. Fifty-three steps daily. Fourteen months of work that matters. Maintenance as meditation. Presence as purpose.

Small peace. New peace. Fragile peace.

Real peace.

Enough.
