# Chapter 24: Arrays

**David Chen | Year 7, Month 2 | Antarctic Solar Arrays**

---

Platform 73. Dawn breaking across the ice. David clipped his harness at 6:47 AM—three minutes early, same as every day for the past nine years. The Antarctic sun was rising, weak and pale, painting the solar arrays in shades of copper and gold.

"Morning, 47B."

The maintenance robot swiveled toward him, its treads leaving precise tracks in the frost that had formed overnight. *Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague Chen. Platform twelve requires recalibration. Connection housing integrity at seventy-nine percent. Weather optimal for maintenance. You are three minutes early, consistent with historical pattern."

David smiled. Two years working with 47B now. The robot had learned to include that last observation—a quirk in its pattern recognition algorithms that amused David more than it should. "Let's get started."

They moved together across the platform with the coordination of longtime partners. David's boots finding their rhythm on the metal grating, 47B's treads humming in counterpoint. The solar array stretched endlessly in every direction—thousands of platforms forming a geometric garden above the ice. In the distance, the megacity rose like a monument to humanity's persistence. Or its stubbornness. David wasn't sure which.

Eight years remaining.

He used to avoid thinking about it. Now the countdown was just background noise, like the wind or the hum of the arrays. Present but not pressing. The end would come. Until then: work.

Platform twelve waited for them. David pulled his diagnostic tablet without conscious thought. His hands knew the sequence. Connection housing. Standard degradation. The seals were failing in exactly the way seals always failed—moisture intrusion, conductivity drop, integrity at seventy-nine percent. He'd seen this failure mode 127 times over nine years. This would be repair number 128.

"Replacement seals required," 47B reported.

"I know." David was already positioning the extraction tool. "Hand me the housing spanner."

The tool appeared in 47B's manipulator exactly when David's hand reached for it. Perfect timing. They'd developed this synchronization over the years—David anticipating 47B's movements, 47B anticipating David's needs. Better coordination than he'd had with most humans. Better than he had with Amara, certainly.

He pushed the thought away. Focus on work.

The housing came free with a pneumatic hiss. David inspected the seals—cracked, brittle, exactly as expected. He removed them one by one, cleaned the channels, prepared the surface for replacement. His hands moved through the sequence automatically, muscle memory built through hundreds of repetitions.

This was what he did. This was what he was good at.

The new seal slid into place with a satisfying click. David ran his thumb along the edge—smooth, aligned, correct. Something in his chest loosened. Not happiness exactly. Just: rightness. The seal was good. The housing would hold.

"Colleague Chen?" 47B's sensors focused on him. "Is there a problem?"

"No." David resumed work. "Just thinking."

"Thinking can reduce efficiency by 11 to 23 percent, depending on thought complexity. Would you like me to play music to assist focus?"

"No, thanks. I'm fine."

He installed the new seals. Checked the fit. Reassembled the housing. Ran the diagnostic. Green across the board. Integrity back to ninety-two percent. Good for another six months. Six months that would exist whether he did this repair or not, but would exist better because he had.

"Repair complete," 47B announced.

"Good work."

*Beep beep.* "Colleague Chen efficiency rating: optimal."

David almost laughed. How many times had they had this exact exchange? Fifty? A hundred? It never got old. Maybe because 47B meant it. The robot's assessment wasn't politeness or encouragement. Just: observation. David was optimal at this work. The only thing he was still optimal at.

They moved to the next repair. Platform eighteen, voltage regulator misalignment. Then platform thirty-one, panel surface cleaning. The morning passed in familiar rhythm. David's mind could drift while his body worked—hands moving through practiced sequences, tools appearing when needed, 47B's quiet presence beside him.

The maintenance division was down to four humans now. David rarely saw the other three—different shifts, different sectors. The arrays were maintained mostly by robots these days. Forty-four robots, four humans. The ratio inverted from nine years ago. David didn't mind. The robots were reliable. Present. They didn't quit. Didn't despair. Didn't ask why.

They just worked. Like him.

By noon, they'd completed eight repairs. David ate lunch on platform seventy-three—his platform, claimed through years of repetition. Protein bar that tasted like cardboard. Tea from his thermos. 47B entered low-power mode beside him, a companionable silence.

The megacity spread below. Two billion people down there. Maybe fewer. The population statistics were unreliable now. People leaving, people dying, people disappearing into the unofficial zones where governance had dissolved. Antarctica was supposed to be humanity's fortress, the last coordinated society. Instead it was slowly unraveling, threads pulling loose one by one.

But the arrays still worked. The power still flowed. Someone had to maintain that. David did. Because what else?

He finished his tea and stood. "Ready for afternoon schedule?"

47B's sensor array brightened. *Beep beep.* "Afternoon schedule: platforms forty-one through sixty. Routine inspection plus three repair orders. Estimated completion time: 16:47 hours."

They worked. Platform after platform. David's hands knew what to do. Check connections. Verify alignment. Clean surfaces. Update logs. Most platforms required nothing—just confirmation that automation was functioning. Human oversight for systems that barely needed humans.

Why did he keep doing this?

The question surfaced around 2 PM, platform forty-seven. David was tightening a connection that didn't need tightening, checking a reading that was clearly fine. Make-work. Performance. He could skip these steps. The arrays would run fine. Would run for eight more years without his interference.

So why?

He handed a torque wrench to 47B, took the diagnostic probe in exchange. Their movements synchronized without thought—hundreds of repetitions had made the exchange automatic. David ran the diagnostic. Green across the board.

His hands were warm inside the gloves. The sun had shifted, heating the platform surface. He could feel it through his boots. The wind carried ice-salt from the distant glaciers. All of it registered without interrupting the work.

This was why he came back. Not for the future. For this. The weight of the probe. The vibration of the arrays. The reliable presence of 47B's treads on metal.

"Colleague Chen?" 47B was waiting patiently. "Platform forty-seven inspection complete?"

"Yes." David logged the completion. "Platform forty-seven complete. Let's move to forty-eight."

They worked through the afternoon. The understanding didn't change anything practical—same repairs, same sequence, same routine. But something had shifted in David's relationship to the work. He wasn't just going through motions anymore. He was present to them. Aware of his hands moving, tools cooperating, 47B's treads on metal grating, wind on his face, sun declining toward horizon.

This moment. This work. This partnership.

Enough.

Almost enough.

Amara would be at the monitoring station now. Same routine she'd kept for three years. They'd barely spoken since the divorce—occasional messages about shared assets, nothing personal. He could picture her at her console, face lit by data, processing numbers that meant doom.

He went back to work.

4:47 PM. Last platform complete. David's tablet chimed—end of shift notification.

47B pivoted toward him. "Daily maintenance schedule complete. All repairs logged. Colleague Chen performance: optimal. Same time tomorrow?"

"Same time tomorrow," David confirmed.

He could go home. Instead, he went to the break room.

Sublevel three. Empty. David made tea from the kettle in his locker. Sat at the long table. The warmth of the cup against his palms. The faint hum of the building's ventilation.

His tablet showed no messages. He didn't expect any.

Eight years left. He didn't know how to spend them. Didn't know if reaching out to Amara was possible or wise or pointless. All he knew was this: today's work had felt good. Tomorrow's work would feel good too.

David finished his tea. Took the transport home.

Building seventeen, apartment 4C. Lights off when he arrived—always off. He turned on the kitchen light. Made more tea. Sat at the small table.

The apartment was silent. Amara's coffee maker still sat on the counter, unplugged. He'd never moved it. Her jacket had hung by the door for months after she left before he finally put it in a closet.

Eight years left. He didn't know how to spend them.

He went to the bedroom. Lay down alone.

Tomorrow: 5:00 AM alarm. Shower. Transport. Platform seventy-three at 6:47. Greet 47B. Start repairs.

The routine held him. That had to be enough.

Sleep came slowly. But it came.
