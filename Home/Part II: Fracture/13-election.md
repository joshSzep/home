# Chapter 13: Election

**Elena Torres | Year 1, Month 9 | Antarctic Megacity**

---

The campaign posters looked absurd.

Elena stood in the transit hub, staring at her own face on the wall—official campaign photo, professional smile, the slogan Marcus had written: **"Presence Until the End."** Next to it: Marcus Rivera's poster. Younger face, earnest eyes, his slogan: **"Truth Without Theater."**

Democracy in the apocalypse. Two candidates. One position. Thirteen years left.

The absurdity of it all made her want to laugh or cry. She wasn't sure which.

"Mayor Torres?" A voice beside her. Young woman, maybe twenty-five, holding a tablet. "Can I ask about your platform?"

"Of course."

"Why should we vote for you? What can you actually do?"

The question everyone asked. The question Elena asked herself every morning.

"I can show up," she said. "I can maintain order. I can bear witness. I can document. I can say: we mattered, we tried, we faced the end together with dignity. That's all I'm offering."

"But Mayor Rivera says that's just theater. That we should accept reality and distribute resources fairly instead of pretending governance matters."

"He's not wrong," Elena admitted. "Governance is largely symbolic now. The question is: do symbols matter when nothing lasts?"

"Do they?"

"I think so. But you'll have to decide that for yourself." Elena smiled. "That's democracy."

The woman made notes, moved on to interview someone else. Elena watched her go, then turned back to the posters. Her face and Marcus's, side by side. Two philosophies. Two ways of facing the end.

Three months of this. Three months of debates, forums, questions, accusations. Three months of defending a position she barely believed in herself.

Why was she running again?

---

**Year 2, Month 6 — Campaign Begins**

The announcement had surprised everyone, including Elena.

Her first term ended Year 2, Month 9. Most people assumed she'd step down—spend her remaining years with family, with Kenji, with something personal rather than political. Or that elections would be suspended entirely. Emergency powers. Martial law. The usual authoritarian response to crisis.

Elena had refused both options.

"We're holding the election as scheduled," she'd announced at the morning briefing. Five people in attendance—the number had plateaued there. Marcus, Chen, Kowalski, Dr. Ade. All of them staring at her like she'd lost her mind.

"Why?" Chen had asked. Sixty years old, infrastructure coordinator since Year -4. He'd watched his department shrink from eight hundred people to twelve. Watched systems he'd built for millennia fail in months. His question wasn't challenging—genuinely confused. "Power grid's at sixty-two percent. Water at sixty-nine. We're barely maintaining basics. Election takes resources. Staff. Energy. Why spend it on symbolism?"

"Because if we abandon democracy, we abandon everything that made us worth saving in the first place. Because governance without accountability is tyranny. Because someone needs to maintain the forms even if—especially if—the substance seems meaningless."

Chen's face had done something complicated. Not agreement exactly. More like: understanding he'd been wrong to ask. He'd nodded slowly. "Democracy as maintenance work. I get that. I don't like it. But I get it."

"But who'll run against you?" Kowalski had looked genuinely confused. Fifty-six years old, security chief, former military. Three decades of service. He'd buried fourteen officers this year—four suicides, six killed in riots, four from illness. His force was at twenty-three percent capacity. "Who'd want this job? Who'd want any of our jobs? We're governing collapse. Documenting disaster. Bearing witness to the end. I do it because someone has to. You do it because you're stubborn. But who else would volunteer?"

That question had been answered three weeks later when Marcus Rivera filed his candidacy.

Elena had known of him—infrastructure specialist, thirty-two years old, competent and respected. They'd worked together on several projects during her first term. Brilliant mind. Pragmatic approach. Good person.

Not the Marcus who was her assistant. Different Marcus. The confusion of names had been constant during the campaign—reporters mixing them up, voters confused, both Marcuses grimacing at the coincidence. Both Marcus. Both Marcus R in fact. Both the same age. It was like a cosmic joke.

Marcus Rivera's platform was simple: end the theater, accept reality, distribute resources fairly, let people leave, make them comfortable. Stop pretending governance mattered. Focus on practical care until the end.

Elena's platform—if it could be called that—was: maintain order, preserve dignity, bear witness, govern until the end. Keep showing up even when showing up seemed meaningless.

Two valid philosophies. Two honest responses to impossible circumstances.

The election mattered because democracy mattered. Or because maintaining the illusion mattered. Or because someone needed to decide between presence and pragmatism.

Elena wasn't sure anymore.

---

**Year 1, Month 7 — First Debate**

The forum was held in the old city council chamber—space for three thousand people. Elena had expected maybe a few hundred to attend. The chamber was at capacity. Another two thousand watching on screens outside.

People still cared. That surprised her.

Marcus Rivera stood at the other podium, looking nervous but determined. Thirty-two years old. She'd been thirty-two once—young mayor, first campaign, so certain she could fix things. Now sixty-four, fourth campaign, certain she could fix nothing.

The moderator was Dr. Sarah Kim, former journalist, now volunteer coordinator. She'd drawn up the rules: thirty minutes each, alternating responses, one minute rebuttals, closing statements.

Democracy in form if not in function.

"Mayor Torres," Kim began, "your first term has seen the population of Antarctica decline from four point two billion to two point four billion. Infrastructure failing. Crime rising. Suicide epidemic. Death rate six hundred percent above baseline. Why should voters give you another term?"

Elena had practiced this answer. Still felt unprepared.

"You're right. By every measure, my term has been catastrophic. Population loss. System failures. Deaths. All of it happened under my governance." She paused. "But I'm not running on success. I'm running on presence. On showing up. On maintaining dignity and order and democratic process even when—especially when—those things seem meaningless. I can't stop the exodus. Can't stop the deaths. Can't stop the asteroid. What I can do: bear witness. Document accurately. Maintain structure. Say: we existed, we mattered, we tried. That's what I'm offering. Four more years of showing up."

She met the moderator's eyes. "Year 0, we formalized the new calendar. Acknowledged that time itself had reset. Some called it symbolic theater—abandoning the old calendar when we should focus on practical needs. But someone had to say: this is Year 0. This is when our countdown began. This matters enough to document. That's governance. Maintaining order and meaning even when both seem futile."

"Mr. Rivera, your response?"

Marcus stepped forward. He'd dressed professionally—suit, serious expression. But his youth was obvious. Elena at thirty-two had looked young. Marcus at thirty-two looked like a child playing dress-up.

Then he spoke, and the illusion shattered.

"Mayor Torres is honest about what she offers: presence. Witness. Dignity. But I have to ask: what do those words mean? Three thousand people here tonight. Two point four billion across Antarctica. All of us dying in thirteen years. What does 'bearing witness' do for them? How does 'maintaining dignity' help someone who's lost their family, their purpose, their future?"

His voice was strong. Conviction clear. "My platform is different. I'm not offering symbols. I'm offering practical care. Fair resource distribution. Freedom to leave. Mental health support. Comfortable endings. Stop pretending governance matters. Focus on making the time left as bearable as possible. That's real help. Not theater."

The crowd murmured. Elena felt the words land. Effective argument. Honest argument. Possibly correct argument.

"Mayor Torres, one minute rebuttal."

Elena looked at the crowd. Three thousand faces. Two thousand more outside. Four billion total at detection—two point four now—all of them dying. All of them looking for answers she didn't have.

"Mr. Rivera is right that governance is largely symbolic now," she said carefully. "The question is: do symbols matter? I think they do. Especially now. When everything's falling apart, someone needs to maintain order. Someone needs to show up daily. Someone needs to say: this matters, you matter, we're doing this together with dignity. That's not theater—that's practice. Practice of democracy. Practice of community. Practice of caring even when caring can't change the outcome."

She met Marcus's eyes across the stage. "You're offering comfort. I respect that. But I'm offering something else: acknowledgment. Witness. The knowledge that someone saw us, someone recorded us, someone said: humanity faced the end with order and dignity and democratic process. That's worth doing. Even if—especially if—it doesn't change anything."

"Mr. Rivera, rebuttal?"

"That's beautiful philosophy, Mayor. But philosophy doesn't feed people. Doesn't house refugees. Doesn't prevent suicides. Doesn't make dying easier. I respect your principles. But I'm offering practical solutions. That's the choice: symbolic witness or actual care. I think voters want care."

The debate continued. Infrastructure questions. Security policy. Resource allocation. Healthcare. All the practical governance issues that felt simultaneously urgent and pointless.

Elena defended her record—what little defense was possible. Marcus attacked not her competence but her premise. The core question underneath everything: does governance matter if everyone dies?

Elena said yes. Marcus said no. Both were honest. Both made sense.

---

**Year 1, Month 8 — Crisis**

The call came at 3 AM. Elena had been awake—sleep was rare now. She answered immediately.

"Mayor, this is Commander Osei. We have situation at District 7 housing complex."

Elena's heart sank. District 7 was refugee housing—overcrowded, understaffed, struggling. "What kind of situation?"

"Riot. Started as protest about resource distribution. Escalated. Twelve dead so far. Security trying to contain but—"

"I'm coming." Elena was already dressing. "Don't use lethal force. Contain only. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

Marcus—her assistant Marcus, not her opponent—met her in the lobby. "I heard. I'm coming with you."

"You don't have to—"

"I'm coming."

District 7 was chaos. Fires burning. Crowds surging. Security forces in riot gear trying to push back without escalating. Elena arrived to shouting, smoke, rage.

She found Commander Osei. "Report."

"Started six hours ago. Protest about food distribution—some people getting less than allocation. Peaceful initially. Then someone threw something. Someone else responded. Spiral from there." Osei's voice caught. "Twelve confirmed dead. Thirty injured. And one—" He stopped. "One murder. Not riot death. Actual murder. Man beat another man to death with a piece of rebar. Over food containers. Security pulled him off the body. He was still holding it. Crying. Just—holding the dead man and crying."

Elena felt the words land. Murder. Not the abstract violence of riot statistics. A specific man. A specific death. A specific killer.

"The killer?"

"Detained. Identified as Daniel Okonkwo—refugee from flooded Jakarta, three children, unemployed for fourteen months. Victim is Raj Patel, thirty-one, also refugee. They knew each other. Both desperate. Both starving." Osei looked sick. "Okonkwo keeps saying he didn't mean to. Says he just—snapped. Patel had three containers. Okonkwo had none. Fight started. Then..."

Elena understood. Desperation meeting desperation. Rage erupting from helplessness. A moment of violence ending in death. And then: the horror of what was done.

"Where is he now?"

"Holding cell. Confession recorded. Physical evidence clear. Open-shut case for prosecution."

Open-shut. Elena filed this away. Someone would need to decide what justice meant when everyone died in thirteen years. Someone would need to determine if punishment mattered when permanence didn't exist. Not now. But soon.

"What do they want?" Elena asked, nodding toward the crowd.

"Honestly? They want to not be dying in thirteen years. Failing that: fair food, better housing, someone to blame." Osei looked exhausted. "We can't give them any of that."

Elena studied the crowd. Hundreds of people. Angry. Desperate. Doomed. All of them facing extinction. All of them looking for control over something, anything.

"Open the barricade," she said.

"Mayor—"

"Open it. I'm going in."

Marcus—assistant Marcus—grabbed her arm. "Elena, this is insane. They're rioting. You'll be killed."

"Maybe. Or maybe they need to see someone who'll show up. That's my entire platform, isn't it? Presence. Witness. Showing up even when it's dangerous."

"This is suicide."

"This is governance."

She walked through the barricade before anyone could stop her. Alone. Unarmed. Sixty-four years old. Mayor of a dying city. Walking into a riot.

The crowd saw her. Noise faltered. Someone shouted: "That's Torres!"

Elena kept walking. Reached the center. Stood there. Waiting.

A woman stepped forward—young, maybe thirty, face twisted with rage and grief. "You! This is your fault! All of this!"

"Yes," Elena said simply.

That stopped the woman. "What?"

"You're right. I'm mayor. This happened under my governance. The shortages. The deaths. The failures. All mine."

"Then fix it!"

"I can't." Elena met the woman's eyes. "I can't stop the asteroid. Can't bring back the dead. Can't give you futures. Can't make this fair or right or bearable. I'm powerless to fix any of it."

"Then why are you here?"

"Because I'm still mayor. Because showing up matters. Because someone needs to bear witness." Elena looked around at the crowd. "I see you. I see your anger. Your grief. Your fear. I see the unfairness. I can't fix it. But I see it. I'm documenting it. I'm saying: this mattered. You mattered. And I'm sorry. I'm so deeply sorry that this is what we're living through."

Silence. The woman was crying now. Others crying too. The rage hadn't disappeared—couldn't disappear—but something had shifted.

"What do we do?" someone asked.

"We continue," Elena said. "We live the thirteen years left as well as we can. We care for each other. We maintain dignity. We face the end together instead of alone. That's all we can do. But it's not nothing."

The riot didn't end cleanly. People didn't magically calm down. But the spike of violence passed. Security distributed emergency rations. Elena stayed for six hours—talking, listening, bearing witness.

Seventeen dead total. Forty-three injured. One murder. Resources redistributed more fairly. Temporary peace.

At hour five, Elena visited the holding cell.

Daniel Okonkwo sat on the bench, hands still bloodstained despite washing. Thirty-four years old. Thin—everyone was thin now. Three children waiting somewhere for a father who'd killed a man over food.

"Mr. Okonkwo," Elena said.

He looked up. Recognition and shame collided in his expression. "Mayor Torres. I—" His voice broke. "I killed him. Raj. He was my friend. We worked together before. I killed my friend."

"Tell me what happened."

"I don't know. I was so hungry. My children—they're eight, six, and four. They hadn't eaten in two days. Allocation center ran out before we got there. Happened three times this week. Then I saw Raj with three containers. *Three*. And I just—" He gestured helplessly. "I asked if he could spare one. Just one. He said no. Said his family needed them. Then I got angry. Then he got angry. Then I picked up the rebar and..." 

Tears now. "I didn't mean to kill him. I swear. I just wanted food. I just wanted my children to eat. And now Raj is dead and his children don't have a father and my children—" He couldn't finish.

Elena watched this man dissolve into grief. The statistics were real now. Murder rate up 500%. This is what that meant. Desperate people killing each other. Friends turning on friends. Humanity fracturing under the weight of extinction.

Marcus—assistant Marcus—stood in the corridor outside. He'd followed her despite the danger. When she emerged, his face was troubled.

"That man," he said quietly. "Daniel. I heard the story. Three starving children. Desperate act. Immediate remorse." He paused. "This is exactly the kind of case that needs mercy, not punishment."

"He killed someone, Marcus."

"Over food. During a distribution failure. Under conditions of extraordinary duress. If the allocation system had worked—if we'd governed better—Raj Patel would still be alive." His voice was urgent but not accusatory. "Elena, we only have thirteen years. Imprisoning him for that entire time... what does that accomplish? His children lose their father. He dies in a cell. Justice becomes cruelty."

Elena felt the weight of it. Marcus was right about the circumstances. The system had failed. The allocation center running out three times in one week was governance failure. Daniel's crime was born from that failure, from desperation, from the unraveling of everything.

But Raj Patel was still dead. His family still destroyed. Justice still mattered. Even—especially—when time was short.

"What happens to me?" Daniel asked.

"Trial. Probably conviction. Probably prison."

"For how long? We only have thirteen years."

"Yes."

"So I'll die in prison. Away from my children. Never seeing them again. Because I killed my friend over food." His laugh was broken. "Justice, I guess."

Elena had no answer. Justice did require consequence. Even when—especially when—nothing lasted. But standing here, looking at this grieving killer, hearing Marcus's plea for mercy, she felt the weight of what would come. Someone would need to sentence him. Someone would need to decide what punishment meant when everyone was already condemned.

Marcus—assistant Marcus—drove her home at dawn. "That was insane," he said.

"I know."

"It was also... I don't know. Important, maybe. You showed up. That mattered to them."

"Did it matter enough?"

"Does it have to be enough? Or just: something real?" He glanced at her. "Rivera's going to use this. The riot. The deaths. Evidence your governance is failing."

"He'd be right."

"But you'll keep running anyway."

"Yes."

"Why?"

Elena watched the dawn light over Antarctica. Two point four billion people. Thirteen years left. Everything falling apart. Her governance a desperate attempt to maintain order in chaos.

"Because someone has to show up," she said. "Even when showing up accomplishes nothing. Even when it's dangerous. Even when it's futile. Someone has to say: I'm here. I see you. This matters. That's governance. That's what I'm offering."

Marcus nodded. "Then I'll keep helping you offer it."

---

**Year 1, Month 9 — Election Day**

Voting occurred over three days—staggered to allow maximum participation. Polling stations across Antarctica. Digital voting for those who'd left. Accessible. Democratic. Maintained.

Elena voted on the first day. Cast her ballot for herself—not from ego, from consistency. She believed in what she offered. Even when she doubted whether it mattered.

The campaign had been exhausting. Three months of debates, forums, questions. Marcus Rivera had been relentless—not cruel, but thorough. Attacking her premise. Arguing for pragmatism over symbolism. Making valid points.

The riot became central to both campaigns. Rivera used it as evidence: see what happens when you govern symbolically? People riot. People die. Better to focus on practical care.

Elena used it differently: I showed up. I walked into danger. I bore witness. That's what I'm offering.

Two philosophies. Two approaches. Both honest.

The final debate, two days before voting, came down to one exchange:

**Rivera**: "Mayor Torres, I respect your dedication. But I have to ask: what are you governing for? What's the point? Everyone dies in thirteen years. All your policies end. All your work erases. Why maintain the forms?"

**Elena**: "Because the forms are what made us human. Democracy. Order. Dignity. Community. If we abandon those because they don't last, what are we saying? That only permanence has meaning? I reject that. The thirteen years matter precisely because they're all we have. Governance matters precisely because the outcome is certain. Someone needs to show up. Someone needs to maintain dignity. Someone needs to say: we existed, we mattered, we tried. That's worth doing until the end."

**Rivera**: "That's beautiful. But it's still just performance. Empty symbolism."

**Elena**: "All governance is performance. All leadership is symbolic. That doesn't make it meaningless. Especially now. When everything's collapsing, symbols are what hold us together. Democratic process. Public accountability. Showing up. These aren't empty—they're essential. They're what separate civilization from chaos. I'm offering four more years of that. If voters think that's worth having, I'll serve. If not, you will. Either way: democracy continues. That alone matters."

The applause had been genuine. Elena wasn't sure if it meant votes.

---

**Year 1, Month 9, Day 3 — Results**

The count finished at 11 PM. Elena watched from her office. Marcus—assistant Marcus—beside her. Chen, Kowalski, Dr. Ade present. The five people who'd governed together for two years.

The numbers appeared on her screen.

**Elena Torres: 61%**
**Marcus Rivera: 39%**

Elena stared at the numbers. Sixty-one percent. Not overwhelming. Not the seventy or eighty percent from her first election. But: a majority. A mandate. Democratic legitimacy.

She'd won.

The victory felt hollow. Four more years governing extinction. Four more years of briefings for five people. Four more years bearing witness to collapse. This was what she'd fought for?

Chen was staring at his own screen, his thin face unreadable. Then: "Sixty-one percent voted for witness over pragmatism. For forms over comfort. That's... unexpected. I would've voted Rivera. Pragmatic care makes sense. But." He looked up at Elena. "They chose you. Chose this. Maybe symbols matter more than I thought."

Kowalski grunted. "Rivera had the right ideas. Wrong timing. People don't want comfort. They want someone to say: this matters. You matter. We're not giving up." His gruff voice softened. "Four more years of 7 AM briefings, Mayor. I'll be there. Someone has to witness you witnessing us."

"Congratulations, Madam Mayor," Marcus said softly.

"Thank you."

"What are you feeling?"

Elena considered. "Relieved. Terrified. Grateful. Sad. Confused about whether this matters. But: glad they chose this. Glad democracy continues. Glad someone wants witness over pragmatism." She turned to her small team. "Thank you. All of you. For staying. For helping. For governing the ungovernable."

"Speech time," Chen said. "Crowd's waiting at victory hall."

Elena had prepared remarks. Standard victory speech. Thank the voters. Acknowledge the opponent. Promise to serve well. All the usual forms.

She left her notes on the desk.

---

Victory hall held maybe five hundred people—supporters, staff, curious observers. Small crowd compared to her first victory. But: present. Real. Engaged.

Elena walked to the podium. Looked at the faces. Five hundred people who'd voted for symbolic governance. Who'd chosen witness over pragmatism. Who believed showing up mattered even when it didn't change anything.

"Thank you," she said. "To everyone who voted—for me or for Mr. Rivera. Thank you for maintaining democracy. For believing the process matters. For showing up."

She paused. The prepared remarks felt wrong. She spoke from instinct instead.

"I need to be honest. I don't know if I'm the right choice. Mr. Rivera offered practical care. Comfort. Ease. Real help for people suffering. I offered... presence. Witness. Symbolic governance. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe symbols don't matter. Maybe governance is just theater."

The crowd was silent. Elena continued.

"But I believe—I have to believe—that showing up matters. That maintaining order matters. That democratic process matters. Even when—especially when—those things don't change the outcome. Someone needs to say: we tried. We cared. We faced the end together with dignity. That's what I'm offering. Four more years of showing up. Of bearing witness. Of governing not to save you—I can't—but to honor you. To say: you mattered. This mattered. Until the very end."

She gripped the podium. "I promise to serve with honesty. To maintain democracy. To bear witness accurately. To show up every day until I can't anymore. That's all I can offer. If that's enough, then I'm grateful you chose me. If it's not... well. Four years from now, you can choose differently. Democracy continues. That's what matters most."

The applause was warm. Genuine. Elena felt it wash over her—acknowledgment, support, democratic mandate. Two point four billion people. Sixty-one percent chose her. Chose witness. Chose presence.

That had to mean something.

---

**Year 1, Month 9, Day 4 — Concession**

Marcus Rivera called the next morning. Elena almost didn't answer—exhausted, overwhelmed, doubting everything. But: respect demanded it.

"Mayor Torres. Congratulations."

"Thank you, Mr. Rivera. You ran an excellent campaign."

"Wasn't enough." He didn't sound bitter. Tired, maybe. Disappointed. But: gracious. "You won fairly. The people chose your philosophy over mine. I respect that."

"Your philosophy was valid. Honest. Maybe more practical than mine."

"But not what people wanted. They want witness. They want presence. They want someone to show up and say: this matters." Rivera paused. "I disagree. I think pragmatic care matters more than symbolic governance. But: I'm not the majority. You are."

Elena heard something in his voice. "What are you thinking?"

"I'm thinking: someone has to help you bear this burden. You're offering four years of witness. That's exhausting. Impossible to do alone. You need support." Another pause. "I disagreed with your philosophy. But the people chose you. If you'll have me... I'd like to serve as your deputy. Help you govern. Offer practical care alongside your symbolic witness. Both necessary, maybe."

Elena was stunned. "You want to work for me?"

"I want to work with you. Different philosophies, complementary approaches. You handle the witness, the presence, the symbolic maintenance. I handle practical distribution, resource allocation, comfort measures. Together: complete governance. As complete as possible given circumstances."

"You'd do that? After opposing me?"

"Opposition was about philosophy, not personal. I believe in democracy. People chose you. That means serving you is serving democracy." Rivera's voice was firm. "So. Will you have me as deputy? Or do you need someone who shares your philosophy completely?"

Elena thought about governing alone. Four more years of morning briefings with five people. Four more years bearing witness to collapse by herself. Four more years of exhausted symbolic maintenance with no practical counterbalance.

Or: partnership. Former opponent turned ally. Symbolic witness plus pragmatic care. Presence plus comfort. Both necessary. Both valuable.

"Yes," she said. "I'd be honored to have you as deputy mayor. Thank you."

"Thank you, Mayor. When do I start?"

"Tomorrow's briefing. Seven AM. Conference room that seats fifty, attended by five. Bring coffee."

Rivera laughed. "I'll bring coffee."

---

**Year 1, Month 9, Day 5 — Morning Briefing**

The conference room for fifty. Present: six people. Elena, Marcus—assistant Marcus—Chen, Kowalski, Dr. Ade. And now: Marcus Rivera, deputy mayor.

The two Marcuses had laughed about it that morning. "This is going to be confusing," assistant Marcus said.

"I'll go by Rivera if that helps," deputy mayor Marcus offered.

"Or I'll go by Reyes—my middle name," assistant Marcus suggested.

But before they could settle on names, assistant Marcus—Reyes—set down his tablet. "Actually, Mayor. I need to tell you something. I'm resigning."

Elena looked at him, startled. "What?"

"I've been your assistant for eight years. Since before detection. Before everything changed." He smiled slightly. "You don't need an assistant anymore. You need a deputy mayor. Someone to share the burden. That's Rivera. My role is... redundant now."

"You're not redundant," Elena protested.

"Not redundant. Complete." Reyes met her eyes. "I helped you through two years of apocalypse. Watched you become the mayor who bears witness. Now you have someone who can actually help govern. I can leave knowing you're not alone."

"Where will you go?"

"My original home. Mumbai. See my family, what's left of them, for the first time in six years. Find a life, a new purpose." He picked up his tablet again. "But first: one last briefing. I want to see Rivera in action. Make sure he's worthy of you."

Rivera raised an eyebrow. "No pressure."

"All the pressure," Reyes said cheerfully. "Prove you deserve this job."

Elena felt tears threaten. Eight years. Reyes had been there for her first campaign, her first term, detection, collapse, re-election. Constant presence. Reliable support. Now: leaving. She'd lose him too.

But: he was right. She had Rivera now. Partnership instead of assistance. Shared burden instead of supported solo. Reyes had earned his freedom.

"Thank you," she said quietly. "For everything. For eight years. For showing up when I needed someone. For staying when everyone else left."

"Thank you for letting me serve." Reyes smiled. "Now. Let's do this briefing. Rivera—take notes. That's your job now."

They'd settled on: Rivera for the deputy mayor. No assistant anymore. Just partners in governance.

Elena called the briefing to order. "Population report."

Chen pulled up data. "Two point four billion as of today. Stable for the first time. Departures slowing. Some people actually returning—not many, but: first positive flow since detection."

Elena made notes. First stability. First returns. Tiny signs that maybe, possibly, some people wanted to stay. Wanted to be part of a governed community. Wanted witness and presence.

Or just: nowhere else to go. Hard to say.

"Infrastructure," Elena prompted.

Chen continued, and something in his voice had changed—less hollow, more present. "Power grid at sixty-two percent. Water at sixty-nine. Transit at forty-one. Communications stable. Maintenance crews still critically low but: two dozen new hires this week. First increase in eighteen months."

He paused, set down his tablet—unusual for him. "I've been thinking about maintenance differently since the election. Year 0 to 2, I thought: why maintain systems that end anyway? Why fix infrastructure with no future? Felt absurd." He met Elena's eyes. "But you maintain democracy. Rivera maintains pragmatic care. Kowalski maintains security. We all maintain things that end. Maybe maintenance isn't about duration. Maybe it's about... I don't know. Presence? Showing up? The systems work today because we fixed them yesterday. That matters today. Tomorrow too. Until it doesn't. But today it does."

Elena felt unexpected warmth. Chen was learning the same lesson she'd been struggling with. Presence over outcome. Process over result. Today mattering precisely because tomorrow was temporary.

"That's exactly right," she said quietly. "Thank you for seeing it."

"Security."

Kowalski: "Crime down slightly—eight percent decrease from last month. Not sure if that's enforcement working or criminals dying or people giving up. Murder rate still elevated but stabilizing. No major riots since District 7."

He grimaced—the expression that had become permanent. "I arrested Daniel Okonkwo last month. Good man. Refugee. Killed his friend Raj Patel over food during the District 7 riot. Came with me quietly. Kept saying: 'I killed him. I killed him.' Horror in his eyes. Not criminal. Just: desperate man who did desperate thing." Kowalski's voice went quiet. "Thirty years in enforcement. I know the difference between predators and people who broke. Okonkwo broke. System broke him. Riot broke him. Hunger broke him. Now he's facing fifteen years for manslaughter when we all die in thirteen. Justice or cruelty? Don't know anymore."

The room was silent. Elena thought about Daniel Okonkwo in holding. About Raj Patel dead. About three children without their father. About systems failing so badly that friends killed friends over food.

"You're recommending pardon?" she asked carefully.

Kowalski shook his head. "I'm recommending nothing. I'm just saying: enforcement used to be clear. Crime. Punishment. Justice. Now?" He spread his hands. "Everything's complicated. Everything's impossible. I enforce the law because someone has to. But the law doesn't account for apocalypse. Doesn't account for good people doing terrible things because systems failed them."

Elena made a note. Daniel Okonkwo. Pardon request likely forthcoming. Decision she'd have to make: justice or mercy. Both had costs.

"Health."

Dr. Ade: "Suicide rate plateaued. Still terrible, still three hundred percent above baseline, but: not increasing. Birth rate microscopic but not zero—forty-seven births last month across two point four billion people. Death rate still elevated. But: nothing catastrophic this month."

Elena documented everything. Then turned to Rivera. "Deputy Mayor Rivera, you have proposals?"

Rivera pulled up his tablet. "Three initiatives. First: revised resource distribution. Current system is supposedly fair but practically uneven. I want transparent allocation—everyone sees exactly what everyone gets. Eliminate perception of unfairness."

"Agreed. Implement immediately."

"Second: expanded mental health services. Suicide is our crisis. I want mobile response teams—not waiting for people to come to hospitals. Go to them. Outreach. Prevention. Care."

"Budget?"

"I'll find it. Transfer from symbolic programs if necessary—"

"Don't cut symbolic programs," Elena interrupted. "Find budget elsewhere. But yes, approved."

"Third: departure support. People who want to leave—help them leave well. Organized transport. Destination planning. Resources. Make exodus orderly instead of desperate."

Elena considered this. Helping people leave seemed counterintuitive—wasn't she trying to govern them? But: people were leaving anyway. Making it orderly honored their choice.

"Approved. All three initiatives. Start immediately."

Rivera nodded. "Thank you, Mayor."

The briefing continued. Practical governance alongside symbolic governance. Presence plus care. Both necessary. Both valuable.

After, both Marcuses stayed.

Reyes pulled up his tablet. "Before I go—one last thing. Daniel Okonkwo."

Elena felt the name like a weight. Three months since the riot. The trial had been swift—confession, evidence, conviction. Manslaughter. Fifteen years. Meaningless sentence when everyone died in thirteen.

"What about him?"

"I've been visiting him. Weekly. Since the sentencing." Reyes met her eyes. "He's falling apart. Grief, guilt, separation from his children. He writes letters to Raj Patel's widow—Priya Patel, Indian-British engineer, two young children of her own—every week. She never responds. He keeps writing anyway. Apologizing. Explaining. Begging forgiveness."

"Reyes—"

"I think you should pardon him."

The words hung there. Elena felt them settle. Pardon. Mercy instead of justice. Forgiveness instead of consequence.

"He killed someone."

"Yes. In desperation. Over food. During a riot caused by governance failures—not your fault specifically, but: system failures we all participated in." Reyes leaned forward. "Elena, he's not dangerous. He's destroyed by what he did. Keeping him in prison for thirteen years accomplishes nothing except more suffering. His children need him. He needs them. Priya Patel has to raise her own children alone while carrying this rage and grief. And Raj Patel is still dead whether Daniel rots in a cell or tries to live with what he did."

"Justice requires consequence."

"Does it? Even when everyone's already condemned? Even when the consequence is just additional cruelty?" Reyes's voice was gentle. "I'm not saying he deserves forgiveness. I'm saying: mercy might matter more than justice when nothing lasts. Let him try to be present for his children. Let him carry his guilt in freedom instead of a cell. That's not absolving him—it's allowing him to face what he did while still living."

Elena thought about this. Daniel Okonkwo in a cell, writing unanswered letters, separated from his children, dying in prison. Daniel Okonkwo free, raising his children, carrying Raj Patel's death every day, trying to be present despite everything.

Both were punishment. One involved mercy.

"I can't," she said finally. "If I pardon him, what message does that send? That killing is acceptable when you're desperate? That consequence doesn't matter?"

"It sends the message that mercy matters more than judgment when time is short." Reyes stood. "But: it's your decision. I just wanted to ask before I left."

He packed his belongings carefully—tablet, stylus, eight years of notes backed up to the archive. "That's it, then. My last briefing."

"You could stay," Elena offered. "Different role. Still part of the team."

"I could. But I shouldn't." He looked at Rivera. "Take care of her. This work destroys people. She's survived two years because she's impossibly strong. But she needs someone to share the weight. Do that."

"I will," Rivera promised.

Reyes turned to Elena. "You're going to be fine. Better than fine. You have real help now. Partnership instead of assistance. That's what you've needed all along."

"I'll miss you."

"I'll miss this. But I'll be alive. In Mumbai. With my family. That matters more." He smiled. "Show up every day. Bear witness. Keep governing. You're doing something important even when it feels impossible."

"Practice as purpose."

"Exactly." Reyes picked up his bag. "Goodbye, Mayor. Thank you for eight years of meaning."

He left. Elena watched him go—one more person departing, one more loss in years of losses. But: he was going toward something. Family. Home. Life. That mattered.

She turned to Rivera. "Just us now."

"Just us," he confirmed. "Thank you for trusting me."

"Thank you for serving."

"I still disagree with your philosophy," he said honestly. "I still think symbolic governance is mostly theater. But: people chose it. My job is serving what they chose. I can do that while offering practical help."

"That's democracy," Elena said. "Not everyone agrees. But everyone serves the decision."

"Exactly."

Rivera left. Elena sat alone in the too-large conference room. Five people now. Reyes gone. Rivera present. Former opponent now partner. Four more years of governance ahead.

She'd won. Sixty-one percent. Democratic mandate. Legitimate authority. The people chose witness. Chose presence. Chose her.

Reyes was gone—home to Mumbai, to family, to life. Eight years of service complete.

Rivera was here—former opponent, current partner. Four years of collaboration beginning.

The victory still felt hollow—governing extinction didn't become meaningful just because people voted for it. But: it became legitimate. Accountable. Democratic.

That was something. Maybe: everything.

**Year 1, Month 9, Day 6 — Letters**

That evening, Elena sat at her desk. Exhausted. Victorious. Confused about whether victory mattered.

Two letters to write.

First: to Wei. The philosopher who'd guided her through two years of apocalyptic governance. Weekly letters about presence, practice, bearing witness. Elena had responded occasionally—brief notes, philosophical questions, grateful acknowledgments.

*Professor Wei,*

*I won the election. 61%-39%. Four more years of governance ahead. I should feel victorious. Instead I feel: relieved, terrified, grateful, and deeply uncertain whether this matters.*

*My opponent offered practical care. I offered symbolic witness. People chose witness. Does that make it valuable? Or just: preferred theater?*

*You wrote once that outcome is irrelevant, practice is everything. I'm trying to believe that. Trying to govern not for result but for process. Trying to show up because showing up is its own purpose. Some days I believe it. Some days it feels like elaborate self-deception.*

*Four more years. I'll continue. Because people chose this. Because someone should maintain democracy until the end. Because witness matters even if—especially if—it doesn't change anything.*

*Thank you for your letters. They help more than you know.*

*With respect and gratitude,  
Mayor Elena Torres*

Second letter: to Kenji. Her son. Twenty-six now. Somewhere in the world seeking answers she couldn't provide. She'd received two messages from him in six months—brief texts confirming he was alive. Nothing substantial. Nothing real.

*Mijo,*

*I won the election. Four more years as mayor. I don't know if you care. Don't know if you're reading these messages. But: I'm your mother. I'll keep writing.*

*Marcus Rivera ran against me. Good person, valid philosophy, honest campaign. He offered practical care. I offered symbolic witness. People chose me. Now he's my deputy. Former opponent, current ally. Democracy is strange and beautiful.*

*I miss you. I don't know where you are or what you've found or whether seeking is helping. But: I hope you're alive. Hope you're finding something. Hope thirteen years is enough time to discover whatever you're looking for.*

*Come home when you're ready. Or don't. Just: be alive. Please.*

*Love always,  
Mom*

She sent both letters. Sat alone in her office. Looked out at Antarctica—two point four billion lights, democratic civilization, all temporary.

Four more years of this. Four more years of morning briefings and practical governance and symbolic witness. Four more years bearing the burden of leadership while powerless to save anyone.

Why had she fought for this?

Because someone had to show up. Because democracy mattered. Because witness honored existence even when existence ended. Because presence was purpose even without permanence.

Maybe.

Elena pulled out Wei's most recent letter. Read it again.

*Mayor, you asked whether election matters if everyone dies. I think: election matters because everyone dies. Precisely because outcome is certain, process becomes valuable. You maintain democracy not to achieve result. To practice democracy itself. The practice is the point. Duration irrelevant. With respect, Professor Wei.*

Practice as purpose. Process as point. Showing up as complete governance.

Elena had four more years to practice. Four more years to show up. Four more years to govern the ungovernable.

Then: Year 6 election. If anyone bothered. If democracy persisted. If anything remained.

But that was later. Unknown. Distant.

Right now: victory. Mandate. Democratic legitimacy. Partnership with former opponent. Six people governing two point four billion.

Small team. Impossible task. Meaningful practice.

Enough.

Elena turned off her office lights. Went home. Tomorrow: another briefing. Another day of governance. Another day of showing up. Without Reyes. With Rivera instead. Different partnership. Same purpose.

Four more years of that ahead.

Thirteen years total until the end.

She'd serve them all. Because people chose her. Because democracy continued. Because witness mattered.

Even if it didn't change anything.

Especially because it didn't change anything.

The practice was the point.

---

**Closing**

Two point four billion people. One elected mayor. One deputy mayor who'd opposed her, now served her. Five people in a conference room for fifty. Reyes gone home. Democracy maintained. Witness continued. Governance practiced.

Four more years ahead. Then: another election. Or not. Uncertainty remained.

But today: legitimate. Democratic. Chosen.

Elena Torres, Mayor of Antarctica, governing not to save anyone.

To honor them.

Until the end.
