# Chapter 10: Defiance

**Zara Okafor-Mensah | Year 0, Month 10 | Lagos District**

---

The contractions came in waves—building, cresting, receding. Zara breathed through them the way the pre-recorded instructor had taught her, focusing on the count. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. Between contractions, she stared at the delivery room ceiling, noting its clinical blankness. Someone had removed the calming nature images that used to be standard. Why pretend at serenity when everyone was dying?

"You're doing great," Kwame said beside her, his hand warm in hers. His voice was steady, but she could feel his palm sweating.

The delivery ward was half-empty. Through the observation window, Zara could see three other rooms occupied out of sixteen. Two years ago, all sixteen would have been full, with a waiting list. Now: the maternity staff had been reduced to a skeleton crew of three nurses and one doctor covering the entire floor. Automation handled the monitoring—sensors tracking her vitals, the baby's heartbeat, contraction intervals. The machines didn't judge. The humans did.

Another contraction. Worse this time. Zara squeezed Kwame's hand hard enough that he gasped. "Sorry," she managed.

"Don't be sorry. Break my fingers if you need to."

Nurse Chen appeared in the doorway—one of the three who'd stayed. Young, maybe twenty-five, with tired eyes that had seen too much in two years. "How are we doing?"

"Contractions every four minutes," the monitoring system announced in its pleasant, inhuman voice.

Nurse Chen checked the displays, nodded. "You're at eight centimeters. Almost there. I'll get Dr. Okonkwo." She paused at the door. "Dr. Tanaka asked to be paged when you're close—wants to do the newborn exam personally since she'll be his pediatrician."

Zara managed a smile through the pain. Dr. Tanaka had been Maya's doctor since birth—Japanese-Nigerian, specialized in child development, one of the few pediatricians who'd stayed in Lagos after detection. She'd admitted in their last prenatal consult that her entire specialty felt absurd now. "I became a pediatrician to help children grow toward adulthood," she'd said quietly. "Now I watch them grow toward nothing." But she'd stayed anyway. Still showed up. Still cared.

Almost there. Almost to the moment when Zara would hold her son. Her second child. Her choice. Her defiance.

The messages had started the moment she announced the pregnancy six months ago. Strangers on public forums: *"How could you?"* Friends expressing concern carefully: *"Are you sure this is wise?"* Kwame's mother, crying on a video call: *"Why bring a child into this?"* Even Maya's daycare teacher, gentle but pointed: *"Have you thought about what you're doing to Maya? Giving her a sibling she'll lose?"*

Zara had thought about it. Had thought about nothing else for months before they'd made the decision. The question Kwame had asked that first night, sitting on their balcony while the world processed its extinction: *Should we have another child?*

They'd talked for hours. Days. Weeks. The arguments against were obvious, numerous, compelling. Fourteen years of life instead of eighty. Fourteen years of knowing the end was coming. The cruelty of consciousness given and then taken. The selfishness of creating life for their own comfort. The burden on Maya of having a sibling in the apocalypse.

But Wei's words kept returning to Zara: *Was Maya not always going to die? Was her life not always temporary?*

Everything was temporary. That had always been true. The asteroid just made it visible.

Fourteen years of consciousness was more than infinite non-existence. Fourteen years of love, of experience, of mattering. Brief didn't mean meaningless. Wei taught her that in the garden, watching flowers bloom and fall, watching the lemon tree fruit and rest. Impermanence and beauty weren't opposites. They were partners.

Another contraction. The worst yet. Zara cried out despite herself.

"Almost there," Kwame repeated, his own face pale. "You're so strong. Almost there."

Dr. Okonkwo arrived—mid-fifties, steady hands, eyes that had delivered thousands of babies and now delivered almost none. She checked Zara's progress with practiced efficiency. "Ten centimeters. Ready to push."

Ready. Zara wasn't sure about ready. Ready to bring a child into a world with an expiration date? Ready to love someone completely while knowing exactly when she'd lose him? Ready to watch her son grow up under a countdown?

But ready or not, he was coming.

"Next contraction, I want you to push," Dr. Okonkwo said. "Big push. Channel everything into it."

The contraction built. Zara pushed. Pain and pressure and the overwhelming sensation of her body doing something enormous, something ancient, something that had been happening for millions of years and would stop happening in fourteen years.

"Good! Again!"

Push. Breathe. Push. The room narrowed to just this—the effort, the pain, the work of bringing life into the world. Kwame's voice in her ear. Dr. Okonkwo's steady instructions. Nurse Chen's hands supporting her.

"I can see the head! One more big push!"

Zara pushed with everything she had. Felt something shift, release, complete. Then: a sound. A cry. Thin and indignant and absolutely, perfectly alive.

"It's a boy," Dr. Okonkwo said, but Zara already knew. Had known for months. Had chosen his name months ago. "Healthy. Perfect."

Perfect. Doomed. Both true.

They placed him on her chest—wet, warm, squirming. Kofi Okafor-Mensah. Six pounds, four ounces. Fourteen years of life ahead of him. Right now: brand new. Right now: here.

Zara looked at her son's face—eyes squeezed shut, mouth open in protest at being born. She felt the fierce love she'd felt with Maya, that overwhelming protective instinct that made everything else secondary. You will matter, she thought. Your brief life will matter. I promise.

Kwame was crying, his hand gentle on Kofi's tiny head. "He's beautiful."

"He is," Zara agreed.

Nurse Chen's face was professional, but her eyes were sad. "Congratulations," she said carefully. "He's beautiful."

The weight of that sadness—the pity, the judgment, the unspoken question: *How could you?*—settled over the room like fog. Zara felt it but didn't absorb it. She'd made her choice. She'd live with the consequences. And right now, those consequences were squirming against her chest, alive and real and hers.

---

The first week home was a blur of feeding, changing, sleeping in two-hour increments. Kofi was a good baby—healthy appetite, strong lungs, already tracking faces with his dark eyes. Maya was fascinated and terrified in equal measure, hovering near her brother but afraid to touch him without permission.

"Gentle," Zara said for the hundredth time, guiding Maya's hand to Kofi's soft hair. "See? So soft."

"Baby Kofi," Maya whispered, three years old and suddenly so big compared to her brother. "Hi, baby."

Kofi's eyes found Maya's face. He didn't smile yet—too young—but he looked. Focused. Saw his sister.

"He knows me!" Maya's face lit up with wonder.

"He does," Zara confirmed. "You're his big sister. He'll know you his whole life."

Fourteen years, she didn't say. Kofi would be fourteen when he died. Maya would be seventeen when she died. Brief, precious time. All they'd get.

The messages started that week too. Zara's public profile—an engineering forum where she'd been active for years—exploded with comments after she posted a simple photo: *"Welcome, Kofi."*

*"How could you? That baby will know nothing but fear."*

*"Selfish. Absolutely selfish. You brought him here for YOUR comfort."*

*"You gave him fourteen years of suffering instead of infinite peace of non-existence."*

*"What kind of mother does this?"*

*"He'll grow up knowing exactly when he'll die. That's psychological torture."*

Some defenders appeared too:

*"Life matters regardless of length."*

*"She has the right to her choice."*

*"Fourteen years of love is better than nothing."*

But mostly: condemnation. Anger. Disgust. The judgment of strangers who'd decided that choosing life in the apocalypse was unforgivable.

Zara read them all that first week. Let the words cut. Let the anger of others sink in. Then, methodically, she blocked the worst offenders and turned off public comments. She'd made her choice for her reasons. She didn't owe strangers an explanation.

But the doubt crept in anyway. Late nights feeding Kofi, watching his small face in the dim light, Zara wondered: Did I do the right thing? Is this cruelty disguised as love? Will he thank me for his fourteen years, or curse me?

Kwame found her crying at three in the morning, Kofi asleep in her arms.

"What's wrong?" He sat beside her on the couch, exhausted but alert.

"The messages," Zara whispered. "They're right. What did we do? We brought him into this. We made this choice for him, and he'll pay the price."

Kwame was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Everyone makes that choice for their children. Every parent in history. We don't ask to be born. Our parents choose for us. The only difference now is we know the timeline."

"That's not a small difference."

"No," he agreed. "It's not. But Zara—look at him. He's here. He's real. His consciousness exists. Would it be better if he'd never existed at all?"

"I don't know," Zara said honestly. "Ask me again in fourteen years."

"We won't be here in fourteen years."

"Then I guess we'll never know."

They sat together in the darkness, their son sleeping between them. Outside, Lagos District hummed its night sounds—quieter than two years ago, but still alive. Still functioning. Still here.

"Do you regret it?" Kwame asked quietly.

Zara looked at Kofi's face—peaceful in sleep, innocent of everything coming. Did she regret it? She didn't know. Maybe she never would. But regret or not, he was here. Born. Real. Hers to love and protect for fourteen years.

"No," she said finally. "I don't regret it. I'm terrified. I'm heartbroken. But I don't regret him."

Kwame kissed her forehead. "Neither do I."

---

Week two brought a different kind of visitor. Zara was home alone—Kwame back at work half-time, Maya at daycare—when her door chimed. She checked the screen, expecting a delivery. Instead: a woman she didn't recognize. Mid-thirties, carrying a small child, looking nervous.

Zara answered with Kofi strapped to her chest. "Yes?"

"I'm sorry to bother you." The woman's voice was hesitant. "I'm Aisha. I live two floors down. I saw your post. About Kofi."

Zara stiffened, ready for more judgment. "And?"

"And I'm pregnant." Aisha's hand went to her abdomen—barely showing, maybe three months. "I found out last month. Everyone is telling me to terminate. My family, my friends, strangers online. They say I'm being cruel. Selfish. Irresponsible."

"What do you say?" Zara asked.

"I don't know." Tears formed in Aisha's eyes. "I don't know what's right. But I saw your post, and I thought—maybe you could tell me. Do you think it was right? Bringing him here?"

Zara looked at this stranger, this woman carrying her own impossible choice, and felt the weight of the question. Did she think it was right? She'd told Kwame she didn't regret it. But right? That was different.

"Come in," Zara said, stepping aside.

They sat in the living room—plants everywhere, morning light streaming through windows, the ordinary domestic space where Zara had learned she was dying two years ago. Aisha held her daughter, maybe two years old, while Zara held Kofi.

"I can't tell you what's right," Zara said after a long silence. "I can only tell you what I believe. I believe consciousness matters. I believe thirteen years of life is more valuable than infinite non-existence. I believe brief doesn't mean meaningless."

"But they'll know," Aisha said. "They'll grow up knowing."

"They'll grow up knowing what everyone has always known and pretended otherwise. That life is temporary. That nothing lasts forever. That everyone dies eventually. The asteroid just makes the timeline visible."

"That's what you tell yourself?"

"That's what I learned from a very wise woman," Zara said, thinking of Wei in her garden. "She's been preparing for death her whole life. She taught me that impermanence and beauty aren't opposites. That presence matters precisely because nothing lasts."

Aisha was quiet, processing. "Do you think they'll hate us? When they're older? When they understand?"

"Maybe," Zara admitted. "I think about that. Kofi will be fourteen when he dies. Maya seventeen when she dies. Will she hate me for giving her a brother she'll lose? For bringing him into a world where he knows exactly when he'll die? I don't know. Maybe."

"Then how do you justify it?"

"I don't." Zara looked at Kofi, sleeping against her chest. "I can't justify it. I can only do it. Choose life. Choose presence. Choose love despite ending. Maybe that's enough. Maybe it's not. But it's what I have."

Aisha's daughter squirmed down and toddled over to look at Kofi. "Baby," she said.

"Yes, baby," Aisha confirmed, watching her daughter with the same complicated love Zara felt. "Would you be okay? If Mama had another baby?"

The girl considered seriously. "Baby sister?"

"Maybe brother. Like Kofi."

"Okay." Simple acceptance. The way children processed everything—direct, honest, uncomplicated by philosophy.

Aisha looked at Zara. "Thank you. For not pretending it's easy."

"It's not easy," Zara said. "It's terrible and beautiful and I question it every day. But he's here. And I love him. That has to count for something."

After Aisha left, Zara stood at her window, holding Kofi, watching Lagos District continue. Two years into the apocalypse, and life persisted. People worked. Children played. The engineered climate maintained its tropical warmth. Everything temporary. Everything here.

Her tablet chimed—messages from the blocked accounts piling up, finding new ways to reach her. She ignored them. Their judgment didn't matter. Her doubt mattered. Her love mattered. Kofi's life mattered.

Fourteen years. It wasn't enough. But it was something. It was real.

---

Month three, and they established a routine. Morning garden visits to Wei—all four of them now, Kofi strapped to Zara's chest, Maya holding Wei's hand, learning about impermanence through flowers. Wei had declined significantly in two years—wheelchair most days, body failing visibly—but her mind remained sharp, her teaching clear.

"See the lemon tree?" Wei pointed with her cane. "Fifty-two years old. Fourteen years left. Same as Kofi. Should I not have planted it fifty-two years ago because it will end in fourteen?"

"No," Maya said seriously. She'd learned this lesson well. "It's still beautiful. Still makes lemons."

"Very good." Wei's approval warmed the air. "Kofi will be beautiful too. Will make his own fruit. Brief life doesn't mean failed life."

Zara held her son, watching him look at the garden with unfocused newborn eyes. He couldn't see the flowers yet. Couldn't understand the philosophy. But someday he would. Someday he'd know he was dying. Know exactly when. Know his life had an expiration date.

How would she explain it to him? At what age did you tell a child about the asteroid? Maya was three—still innocent, still living fully in the present. When would that change? When did childhood end and apocalypse awareness begin?

"You're thinking too far ahead," Wei said, reading Zara's expression. "He's three months old. Be present to three months old."

"How do you always know?"

"Because you're very obvious." Wei smiled. "And because everyone does it. Projects into imagined future instead of attending to actual present. You can't control when he'll understand. Can't prepare him for that moment. Can only be present with him now. This morning. This garden. This moment of his life."

Maya was examining a gardenia that had bloomed overnight—perfect white petals, fragrant and delicate. "This one's new!"

"Bloomed this morning," Wei confirmed. "Tomorrow, less perfect. Day after, falling. But today—perfect."

"Everything falls," Maya said matter-of-factly. Three years old and already fluent in impermanence. It was beautiful and heartbreaking in equal measure.

Kofi made a small sound—not quite crying, just announcing his presence. Zara adjusted him in the carrier, feeling his warm weight against her chest. This was real. This moment. This child. This garden. This teaching.

The messages still came. The judgment still existed. But here, in Wei's garden, surrounded by temporary beauty and ancient wisdom, it mattered less. Zara had made her choice. She would live with it. Would love her children completely for the time they had.

Fourteen years until Kofi died. Fourteen until Maya died. Fourteen until everyone died.

But today: garden. Flowers. Teaching. Presence.

That was enough.

Had to be enough.

---

The hardest moment came unexpectedly, month four. Zara was scrolling through her contacts—something mundane, looking for a colleague's information—when she saw her sister's name. Amara Okafor. Astrophysicist. The woman who'd detected the asteroid. The woman who'd calculated everyone's death, including her own family's.

Zara hadn't spoken to her sister in over two years. Not since the argument before Maya's first birthday. Amara had been too busy with work to attend. Zara had been hurt, had said things. Amara had responded with cold logic. They'd stopped talking.

Then: the detection. Amara's face on every screen, explaining the calculations, confirming the timeline. Zara had tried to call—sent voice messages, texts, photos. No response. Sent Kofi's birth announcement four months ago: *"You have a nephew. His name is Kofi. Please respond."*

Nothing.

Now, holding Kofi after his feeding, Zara stared at her sister's contact information. Her finger hovered over the call button. What would she say? *I had another baby and you missed it*? *Your nephew exists and you don't care*? *We're dying and you won't even talk to me*?

She pressed call.

It rang once. Twice. Three times. Voicemail.

"Amara, it's Zara. Again. I don't know if you're getting these messages. I don't know if you care. But I'm your sister. Maya is three now. Kofi is four months. They're your family. I'm your family. We have fourteen years left. Please. Just respond. Just once. Let me know you're alive."

She ended the call. Sat holding Kofi in the silence of her apartment. Kwame at work. Maya at daycare. Just her and her son and the absence of her sister.

The next day, she tried again. And the next. Each time: voicemail. Each time: the same message, variations on the theme of *please respond*.

Week two: she sent photos. Kofi's first smile. Maya holding her brother. The four of them in Wei's garden.

Week three: she sent a video. "Hi, Amara. This is Maya. I'm three. This is my brother Kofi. He's a baby. Mama says you're our aunt. Do you want to visit? We live in Lagos District. You can come anytime. Okay, bye!"

Nothing. Complete silence. Her sister had chosen isolation over family. Had chosen data over connection. Had chosen numbness over feeling.

Zara stopped trying after that. Not from anger. From acceptance. This was Amara's choice, just as having Kofi was Zara's choice. Everyone coped differently. Everyone found their own way to survive the countdown.

Amara survived through isolation. Zara survived through defiance. Neither was wrong. Neither was right. Just: different responses to the same impossible situation.

But it hurt. Even understanding it, even accepting it, it hurt. Her sister was alive and present and choosing absence. That loss was its own kind of grief.

"She might come around," Kwame said gently that evening. "When she's ready. When she can."

"Or she won't," Zara said. "And we'll die having never reconciled. That happens too."

"Does it matter? At the end?"

Zara thought about it. Did it matter? Would she regret the estrangement in her final moments? Would Amara?

"Yes," she said finally. "It matters. Not because it changes anything. Because it's real. The absence is real. The loss is real. Brief doesn't make it less meaningful. Terminal doesn't make it less painful."

Kwame held her while she cried—not dramatic sobs, just quiet tears for a relationship that had ended before death ended it. For a sister who was alive but gone. For nieces and nephew who would never know their aunt.

Kofi slept through it, innocent of family drama and complicated grief. Maya climbed into Zara's lap, offering comfort with her small body. "Don't be sad, Mama."

"Sometimes sad is okay," Zara said, holding her daughter. "Sometimes you need to feel it."

"Professor Wei says that too." Maya's wisdom at three years old. "She says feelings come and go. Like flowers."

"Professor Wei is very wise."

"Are you going to be happy again?"

"Yes, baby. I'm going to be happy again."

And she was. The grief for her sister settled into background ache, present but not overwhelming. Life continued. Kofi grew—five months, six months, tracking faces and reaching for objects and beginning to laugh. Maya started pre-school, learning and growing and becoming more herself every day. Kwame maintained his steady presence, working and parenting and loving them all.

The garden visits continued. Wei's teaching continued. The defiant choice to live fully continued.

---

Year Two, Month Nine. Evening. The four of them in their living room—Kwame cooking dinner, Maya playing with blocks, Kofi on a blanket doing tummy time. Ordinary domestic scene. Beautiful domestic scene. Temporary domestic scene.

Zara watched her family and felt the fierce love that had driven her choice. This mattered. These people mattered. This time mattered.

Brief didn't mean meaningless. Wei taught her that. Impermanence didn't negate value. The garden taught her that. Love despite ending was still love. Her children taught her that.

Thirteen years until Kofi died. Thirteen until Maya died. Thirteen until everyone died.

But right now: Kofi lifting his head, proud of his strength. Maya building a tower, proud of her skill. Kwame humming while he cooked, content in his work. Family alive and together and here.

The messages from strangers had stopped—either they'd given up or Zara's blocks were effective. The judgment persisted somewhere, she knew, but it didn't reach her anymore. She'd made her peace with her choice. Doubt would return—probably often—but peace would too.

This was her practice: choosing life. Choosing presence. Choosing love despite certain ending. Not because it was right or wrong, wise or foolish, brave or selfish. Because it was hers. Her children. Her choice. Her thirteen years with Kofi. Her thirteen years with Maya.

That had to be enough.

And watching Maya show Kofi her block tower, watching her son's face light up with interest, watching her husband smile at both of them—Zara thought: maybe it is. Maybe this is enough. Maybe this is everything.

Brief. Precious. Doomed. Beautiful.

Life continuing because what else would it do?

That was the answer. That was the defiance. That was the practice.

Life continued. Love continued. Presence continued.

Until it didn't.

But that was later. Distant. Unknowable.

Now: dinner cooking. Children playing. Family together.

Now: garden tomorrow. Teaching continuing. Flowers blooming.

Now: enough.
