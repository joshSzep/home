# Chapter 14: Breakdown

**Ibrahim al-Rashid | Year 2, Month 2 | Jerusalem / Antarctica**

---

## I. The Last Battle

The rubble was sharp against Ibrahim's shoulder. Twenty-one years old. Two years since detection. Still fighting. Still here. Still defending holy ground that wouldn't exist in thirteen more years.

He'd stopped asking why months ago.

The night was cool—Jerusalem winter, brief respite from desert heat. Ibrahim crouched behind what used to be someone's kitchen wall. Ceramic tiles still visible, blue and white geometric patterns. Traditional. Beautiful. Belonging to a family that had fled or died or simply stopped caring about their home because what was the point?

His squad was positioned across the contested zone. Fifteen fighters. Down from forty two years ago. Some had left. Some had died. Some had simply walked away mid-patrol, dropped their weapons, and disappeared into the city. The commanders didn't chase them anymore.

Commander Hassan's voice crackled in Ibrahim's earpiece. "Movement. Northeast corner. Wait for my signal."

Ibrahim shifted his rifle. The weight was familiar—he'd carried this weapon for five years now. Knew every scratch, every imperfection. Had killed with it. Had cleaned it more times than he'd prayed.

That thought used to disturb him. Now it was just fact.

Across the street, their opponents—Israeli defense militia, probably. Or UN peacekeepers gone rogue. Or other Muslim fighters from different faction. The lines had blurred. Everyone fighting, nobody remembering why. Just: territorial instinct, muscle memory, the inertia of conflict that had lasted three millennia and would continue for twelve more years before becoming irrelevant.

Ibrahim's prayer beads hung from his belt. He hadn't touched them in weeks. Couldn't remember the last time he'd completed all five daily prayers. The brothers pretended not to notice. Or maybe they'd stopped caring too. Even the imam's sermons had become perfunctory. *Serve Allah. Trust the plan. Paradise awaits.* Words recited without conviction.

The whole camp was breaking. Ibrahim could feel it. Some brothers still believed—clung to faith desperately, needed it to function. But most were going through motions. Fighting because that's what they'd always done. Praying because stopping felt like admitting defeat. Existing because the alternative was harder.

"Signal. Now. Go, go, go."

Ibrahim moved automatically. Training overriding thought. Around the rubble, across the street, toward the building where movement had been detected. His squad flanking, covering angles, professional and empty.

Then: the whistle.

Mortar.

He'd heard that sound too many times. Had half a second to think: *drop and cover*. Started moving. Too slow.

The impact was close. Too close. The blast lifted him, spun him, slammed him into stone. Sound disappeared—replaced by high-pitched ringing. Vision blurred. Something wet and hot down his left leg.

Blood. Too much blood.

He tried to stand. His leg wouldn't respond. Looked down—shrapnel had torn through his thigh. Deep. Arterial. The pain hit delayed, then all at once. White-hot. Real. More real than anything had felt in months.

*I'm going to die here,* he thought with strange clarity. *In this street. Defending this wall. For nothing.*

Voices. Hands grabbing him. Brothers dragging him back behind cover. Someone applying tourniquet. The pain was incredible. Ibrahim had been wounded before—twice, minor injuries. This was different. This was serious.

"Stay with us, brother. Stay with us."

Why? The question surfaced unbidden. Why stay? Why fight the darkness? Paradise waited. Martyrdom was honor. Dying for Allah in holy land was the highest achievement.

Except he didn't believe that anymore.

The darkness took him anyway.

## II. Medical Limbo

Waking was gradual. Pain first—dull, chemical-managed, but persistent. Then: sounds. Machines. Voices. Someone checking vitals. Fluorescent light through closed eyelids.

Ibrahim opened his eyes. White ceiling. Clean walls. The antiseptic smell of hospital.

Not the field hospital in camp. Somewhere else.

A nurse appeared—UN uniform, efficient, tired. "You're awake. Good. Don't try to move yet."

"Where—" His voice was rough. Throat dry.

"UN Medical Facility, New Jerusalem Zone. You were medevaced from the contested area three days ago. Severe leg trauma. You've had two surgeries. Do you remember your name?"

"Ibrahim. Ibrahim al-Rashid."

"Good. I'm Nurse Chen. You're stable now. The doctor will brief you on your condition."

She left. Ibrahim lay still, processing. Three days. UN facility. Stable. Alive.

He tried to move his left leg. Pain lanced through him, but the leg responded slightly. Not paralyzed then. That was something.

The ward was large—twenty beds, half occupied. Other fighters, other casualties. Muslim, Jewish, Christian, secular—the UN treated everyone. Some wore their faction's symbols. Most had removed them. In pain and recovery, identities became optional.

Dr. Okonkwo arrived that evening. Nigerian, professional, compassionate but realistic. "Mr. al-Rashid. You're lucky. The shrapnel missed your femoral artery by centimeters. We removed most fragments, but several pieces near your spine are too dangerous to extract. You'll have chronic pain. Significant limp. But you'll walk."

"Can I return to service?"

The doctor's expression was carefully neutral. "That's your choice. Medically, you're combat-ineffective. We recommend discharge. But if you insist on returning, we can't stop you after recovery."

Ibrahim said nothing. The doctor continued: "You have options. Your militia will take you back in support role. Or you can discharge honorably. We have refugee placement services. Many fighters are choosing to relocate—Antarctica has housing, services, infrastructure. You could start over."

"Start over?" The phrase felt absurd. "For thirteen years?"

"Thirteen years is still thirteen years. That's the position we're all in." The doctor's face showed the same weariness everyone wore now. "Think about it. You have time."

Time. Thirteen years. 4,745 days. Then extinction. Whether he died here in Jerusalem or elsewhere made no difference to the asteroid. Made no difference to Allah, if Allah existed. Made no difference to anyone except himself.

And he didn't know if he cared enough about himself to matter.

## III. The Ward

Recovery took six weeks. Longest six weeks of Ibrahim's life.

His leg healed slowly. Physical therapy was painful, frustrating, incremental. He'd been a strong fighter—fast, agile, capable. Now he needed a cane. Limped badly. Felt broken.

But the physical breaking was easier than the other kind.

The ward was full of believers. Most of his fellow patients still held their faiths. The Jewish fighters prayed Shema. The Christian fighters read their Bibles. The Muslim fighters—five of them including Ibrahim—were called to prayer by the eldest, a Syrian veteran named Faisal.

Faisal was forty, devout, unshaken. He'd lost his right arm in combat. Prayed with his left hand on his prayer mat, face serene, faith intact. After each prayer, he'd talk with the brothers. "Allah tests those He loves. This injury is test. Paradise awaits those who endure."

The other Muslim patients nodded. Agreed. Found comfort.

Ibrahim stayed silent.

After a week, Faisal approached him privately. "Brother Ibrahim, you don't pray."

"I'm recovering."

"You can pray lying down. You can pray in your heart. But you don't. Why?"

Ibrahim had been expecting this. Had prepared several deflecting answers. But sitting there, in the clean hospital bed, with nothing left to lose, he found himself saying: "Because I don't believe anymore."

Faisal's face showed shock, then concern, then pity. "Brother, the asteroid is test—"

"Don't." Ibrahim's voice was harder than intended. "Please don't tell me this is a test. Don't tell me Allah's plan is mysterious. Don't tell me faith will return if I practice. I've heard it all. I've tried. The faith is gone."

"Then you're lost."

"I know."

Faisal left. The other Muslim patients avoided Ibrahim after that. Prayed pointedly near him. Tried to model faith, show him what he was missing. Ibrahim felt nothing but awkward awareness of his own emptiness.

One night, Faisal tried again. "Brother, without faith, what do you have? How will you face the end?"

"I don't know."

"Then return to prayer. Even if you don't feel it. The practice sustains—"

"The practice is empty!" Ibrahim's frustration finally broke through. "It's words said to nothing. Movements performed for no one. I did it every day for nineteen years. I killed for it. I bled for it. And when the asteroid came, it all revealed itself as meaningless. Physics doesn't care about prayers. Matter doesn't care about faith. We're going to die—righteous and wicked together—because a rock is falling. Allah isn't guiding it. Allah isn't stopping it. Allah isn't real, or doesn't care, or never was. And I can't pretend anymore."

Silence. The other patients staring. Faisal's face was pained. "You're not just lost, brother. You're choosing to be lost. That's worse."

Maybe. Probably. Ibrahim didn't care. Couldn't care. The numbness was total now.

## IV. Discharge

Month 2 of recovery. Dr. Okonkwo reviewed Ibrahim's file. "You're medically cleared for discharge. Permanent limp, chronic pain manageable with medication. You can return to your unit in support capacity—"

"I'm not returning."

The doctor nodded. Unsurprised. "Then you need to decide where to go. We have placement services. Where's home?"

"Syria. But..." Ibrahim thought about it. His family was dead—parents killed in the climate wars when he was twelve. He'd had brothers in the militia, but they were scattered or gone. Syria itself was different now—cooling planet meant new weather patterns, new agriculture, new everything. The country he remembered didn't exist anymore. "I have no home."

"Many don't. Antarctica is accepting refugees. It's the hub now—largest city, most infrastructure, most services. We can arrange transport."

"What would I do there?"

"Survive. Figure out how to spend twelve years. Same as everyone."

Antarctica. Ibrahim had never been. Never thought he'd leave the Middle East. His whole life had been circumscribed—Syria, then madrasah, then militia, then Jerusalem. Small circles. Defined territories. Fighting for specific ground.

Now: all ground was temporary. All territories would end. Going to Antarctica meant going nowhere special. Which was fine, because nowhere was everywhere now.

"Arrange it," Ibrahim said.

The transport left two weeks later. UN evacuation flight—refugees, wounded fighters, support staff rotating out. A hundred people who'd given up on wherever they'd been. Heading to the Antarctic megacity because what else?

Ibrahim sat by window. Watched Jerusalem recede. The holy city, contested for three thousand years, shrinking to toy-size below. All that blood. All that prayer. All that history. Thirteen years left before vaporization.

He tried to feel something. Sadness, anger, relief. Anything.

Felt nothing.

His prayer beads were in his pocket. Ninety-nine beads. Ninety-nine names of God. He'd carried them every day since childhood. Couldn't remember when he'd last used them. Couldn't remember when they'd stopped being connection and become just weight.

The woman next to him noticed his silence. "First time leaving?"

"Yes."

"I left Delhi two years ago. Went to Lagos. Then São Paulo. Now Antarctica. Keeps moving, you know? Staying in one place felt like waiting for death. Moving feels like... I don't know. Something."

"Does it help?"

She considered. "Not really. But it's different. Different is something."

The flight took eight hours. Ibrahim dozed, woke, stared at clouds, dozed again. The woman shared her food. They didn't talk much. Companionable silence between two people fleeing nothing toward nothing.

Antarctica appeared below—massive city sprawling across ice. Infrastructure everywhere. Domes, towers, transit systems, residential blocks stretching to horizon. Four billion people. More than any city in history. All here because everywhere else had become unlivable during climate shift.

And in thirteen years—empty. Frozen again. Pristine. Like none of this had ever existed.

The landing was smooth. Immigration was perfunctory—scan ID, confirm refugee status, assign housing. "Block 47, Building 12, Unit 403. Rent subsidized for six months. Medical support available. Transit pass issued. Welcome to Antarctica."

Welcome. As if this was destination instead of just another temporary stop.

## V. Fifty-Three Steps

Building 12 was standard refugee housing—twenty stories, five hundred units, communal facilities on ground floor. Clean. Functional. Soulless.

Unit 403 was on fourth floor. Ibrahim stood at the base of the stairwell, looking up. His leg throbbed. The cane helped but didn't eliminate pain. Fifty-three steps to his new home.

He counted them. Needed to. Needed something to focus on besides the emptiness.

One. Two. Three. Left leg strong, right leg weak, cane compensating. Four. Five. Six. The physics of walking remade. Seven. Eight. Nine. Pain manageable, breathing steady. Ten.

A family passed him going down—mother, father, two children. The children stared at his cane. The mother pulled them along quickly. Don't stare at the broken man.

Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Halfway. His leg was screaming now. Ibrahim paused on the landing. Caught his breath. The stairwell was empty except for him. Everyone else probably used elevator. But he needed to know: fifty-three steps. This specific number. This specific pain. Something concrete. Something real.

Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. Resuming. Slower now. The cane bearing more weight. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. The pain sharpening but bearable. Thirty.

Second landing. Third floor. Apartment doors visible. Lives happening behind them. People cooking, sleeping, arguing, loving, existing. All of them doomed. All of them continuing anyway.

Thirty-five. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. Final stretch. The pain was constant now. Ibrahim's jaw clenched. This was penance, maybe. Or just stubbornness. Forty. Forty-one. Forty-two.

Forty-five. Forty-six. Forty-seven. Nearly there. His breath ragged. Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty.

Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

Fourth floor.

He stood at the top, leg trembling, leaning heavily on cane. Fifty-three steps. Now he knew. Tomorrow would be fifty-three steps. Every day until he moved or died or the asteroid came.

Unit 403 was at the end of corridor. Ibrahim limped to it. Scanned his ID. Door opened.

The apartment was small. Bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, single window overlooking city. Furnished minimally—bed, table, two chairs, basic kitchen equipment. Clean. Empty. Waiting.

Ibrahim closed the door. Stood in the center of the room. His new home. His nowhere place.

He lowered himself onto the bed—mattress firm, sheets generic. Set his cane against the nightstand. Pulled out his prayer beads.

Ninety-nine beads. Ninety-nine names. *Ar-Rahman. Ar-Rahim. Al-Malik.*

The names were familiar. He could recite all ninety-nine without thinking. Had done so thousands of times. Prayer, meditation, comfort, connection.

Now: just words. Just sounds. Just beads.

He tried to pray properly. Faced Mecca—or where Mecca was, he wasn't exactly sure from Antarctica. Held the beads. Began the names. *Al-Quddus. Al-Salam. Al-Mu'min.*

Nothing. No connection. No presence. No answer. Just: his voice in an empty room. Beads in his hand. Words in empty air.

*Al-Aziz. Al-Jabbar. Al-Mutakabbir.*

The Mighty. The Compeller. The Supreme. None of it meant anything anymore. Or maybe it never had, and he was only now seeing clearly. Faith as illusion. Prayer as self-comfort. God as human invention to make meaninglessness bearable.

Ibrahim stopped at the forty-third bead. Same bead he'd stopped at three years ago. First night of doubt. Now: doubt was certainty. Faith was gone. And nothing had replaced it.

He set the beads on the nightstand. They looked ordinary. Just object. No power. No meaning. No connection to divine.

His leg throbbed. The medication was wearing off. He should take more. Should eat. Should sleep. Should do something to maintain himself.

Instead he sat on the bed in the strange apartment in the city he didn't know, feeling nothing, being nothing, having nothing.

Twenty-one years old. Thirteen years left. No faith. No identity. No purpose.

Just: alive. Broken. Empty.

The window showed the Antarctic city stretching to darkness. Millions of lights. Billions of people. All temporary. All doomed. All continuing.

Ibrahim lay down. Stared at ceiling. Counted the cracks in the plaster because what else? Fourteen cracks. Specific number. Concrete fact. Something real in the emptiness.

Fifty-three steps to get here. Fourteen cracks above him. Thirteen years remaining. Numbers instead of meaning. Counting instead of believing.

This was his life now. This apartment. This brokenness. This nothing.

Year 3, Month 2. Ibrahim al-Rashid, refugee, formerly faithful, arrived in Antarctica.

No plan. No hope. No faith.

Just: existing.

And thirteen years stretching ahead like fifty-three steps he'd have to climb every day until climbing stopped mattering.

He closed his eyes.

Felt nothing.

That was the point.
