# Chapter 12: Traces

**Kenji Torres | Year 2, Month 11 | Tokyo**

---

The zendo smelled of incense and cold.

Kenji sat in the third row, back straight, hands folded in cosmic mudra, breath counting itself. Seventeen months of this. Year 1, Month 6 to now—Year 2, Month 11. His body knew zazen perfectly. Knees down, spine aligned, chin tucked, shoulders relaxed. Every detail precise.

His mind? His mind was analyzing his posture. Evaluating his breath. Thinking about the technique of not-thinking. Meta-awareness preventing actual awareness. The gap between form and essence that seventeen months hadn't closed.

The temperature was below freezing outside, barely warmer inside the unheated hall. His breath visible in the pre-dawn darkness. Forty monks in rows, all sitting in perfect stillness. Sound: nothing but the wind against wooden walls. Then the han struck—three beats of the wooden board signaling meditation's end.

Bodies rose in unison. Kenji unfolded his legs. Numb again. Poor circulation from sitting incorrectly despite correct form. Everything in his practice was like this: technically perfect, essentially missing.

The monks formed a line for kinhin—walking meditation between sitting periods. Kenji joined the circuit around the zendo. Left foot, right foot, synchronized breathing. Ten steps per exhale. The walking should anchor awareness in the body, pull consciousness out of the head and into feet meeting floor, weight shifting, breath moving.

Instead: Kenji analyzed the walking. *Am I walking too fast? Too slow? Is my posture correct? That monk's form is better. I should adjust my pace. No, wait—thinking about adjusting is the problem. Just walk. But how do I just walk without thinking about walking? The instruction is to feel feet on floor. I'm feeling them now. Or am I thinking about feeling them? Is there a difference?*

The circuit continued. The monks walked in perfect silence. Kenji walked in perfect noise—mental chatter disguised as practice. His body moved correctly. His mind was elsewhere. Gap between physical form and embodied presence. Seventeen months of this gap.

Kinhin ended. They returned to cushions for another sitting period. Kenji's legs were less numb from the walking, but his mind was just as scattered. Maybe more scattered—now he was thinking about how walking meditation should have helped but didn't.

He bowed to his cushion and filed out with the others into the grey morning.

---

After breakfast—rice porridge and pickled vegetables eaten in silence—Roshi announced a special teaching. The senior monks rolled out an ancient scroll, handling it with careful reverence. Ink on silk, colors faded but still visible. Ten images arranged vertically.

"The Ten Ox-Herding Pictures," Roshi said. His voice was quiet, precise. Seventy years old, forty years teaching. "Painted by Kakuan in the twelfth century. Ten stages of the journey from ignorance to enlightenment. From lost to found. From seeking to home."

Kenji leaned forward. This was what he'd come for—a map. A framework. A way to understand the journey he was failing to make.

Roshi began with the first image.

**Picture One: Seeking the Ox**

A boy in wilderness, arms spread wide, looking everywhere. Trees and mountains surround him. The ox—representing true nature, Buddha-nature, understanding—is nowhere visible. The boy is completely lost.

"This is beginning," Roshi said. "Not knowing what you seek. Not knowing where to look. Not knowing you're already what you're seeking. Just: desperate searching. Confusion. Suffering born from separation that doesn't actually exist but feels completely real."

Kenji recognized himself immediately. Year 1, Month 6—leaving Antarctica because everything felt wrong. Seeking answers about how to live with extinction. Running toward wisdom traditions, running from purposelessness. That was Picture One. Seeking desperately.

**Picture Two: Finding the Traces**

Same boy, but now he's crouching, studying the ground. Footprints visible. Ox tracks in the dirt. The teaching has left traces—hints, signs, evidence of the way. The boy has intellectual understanding now. He's read the sutras, learned the practices, knows the path exists.

"This is intellectual grasp," Roshi explained. "Reading about enlightenment. Understanding the philosophy. Knowing the techniques. The ox left footprints. You can see them clearly. But seeing tracks isn't the same as finding the ox. Understanding isn't realization."

Kenji nodded. That's exactly where he was. Seventeen months of study. He understood impermanence, no-self, the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path. He could explain them. Could analyze them. Could write essays about them. Traces found.

**Picture Three: Glimpsing the Ox**

The boy sees the ox's hindquarters disappearing into brush. Brief sighting. The teaching glimpsed but not grasped. Moments of clarity that vanish immediately. Intellectual understanding touching something deeper but unable to stay there.

"You see it briefly during meditation," Roshi said. "Flash of genuine presence. Moment of actual understanding beyond concepts. Then: gone. Back to thinking about the experience instead of having the experience. This is frustrating stage. You know something real exists because you've touched it. But you can't hold it."

Several monks nodded. They'd reached Picture Three. Kenji felt envy—he hadn't even glimpsed the ox yet. Just seen its footprints. Still on Picture Two.

**Picture Four: Catching the Ox**

Boy grabs the ox. Rope around its neck. But the ox fights violently. Bucking, resisting, trying to escape. This is the hardest stage. Understanding wants to flee back into ignorance. The ox of true nature resists domestication.

"This is where practice becomes work," Roshi said. "Not gentle sitting anymore. Real effort. The ox struggles and you must hold the rope. Cannot let go. Must practice even when practice feels impossible. Must sit even when sitting feels futile. Must maintain presence even when mind screams to return to distraction. Very difficult. Many people quit here."

Kenji couldn't imagine reaching Picture Four. The ox wasn't even visible to him yet. How could he catch what he couldn't see?

**Picture Five: Taming the Ox**

Boy leads ox with rope. Still effort required, but cooperation emerging. Ox follows now. Resistance decreasing. Practice is working. Integration beginning. The teaching embodying itself slowly.

"This is where transformation happens," Roshi said. "Still conscious practice—you're aware of maintaining presence, aware of working with mind, aware of technique. But technique starting to work. Presence coming more easily. Integration of understanding into daily life. Not enlightened yet, but: progress. Real progress."

**Picture Six: Riding the Ox Home**

Boy sits on ox, playing flute. No rope needed. No struggle. Effortless practice. Joyful return home. The teaching rides itself now. Presence natural. Understanding embodied.

"This is where teaching can begin," Roshi said. "Cannot teach from Picture One through Four—still learning. Picture Five, maybe teach beginners. But Picture Six: ready to guide others. Practice natural enough that you can help others practice. The journey homeward clear."

Kenji stared at the image. Boy riding peacefully, playing music. Seemed mythical. Impossible. Fantasy.

**Picture Seven: Ox Forgotten, Self Alone**

The ox disappears from the picture. Only the boy remains, sitting peacefully. The teaching is so internalized it becomes invisible. No longer need the framework. Just: being. Natural presence without technique.

"The ox was training tool," Roshi explained. "Once fully internalized, ox vanishes. You don't practice Buddhism anymore—you ARE Buddhist practice. Not following teaching—you ARE teaching. The separation between practitioner and practice dissolves."

One of the senior monks bowed slightly. Kenji wondered if he'd reached Picture Seven. What would that feel like? To be so integrated that the techniques disappeared?

**Picture Eight: Both Ox and Self Forgotten**

Empty circle. Nothing. No boy, no ox, no landscape. Pure emptiness. Complete presence without subject or object. The ultimate goal that can't be sought—because seeking itself is obstacle.

The monks were completely silent, staring at the empty circle.

"Cannot explain this," Roshi said simply. "Words fail. Concepts fail. Just: complete presence. If you reach this, you'll know. Until then: practice."

**Picture Nine: Returning to the Source**

Nature scene—cherry blossoms, stream flowing, tree branches. No boy, no ox. Just: natural world being itself. The teaching reveals that source was always here. Never left. The journey was discovering you never went anywhere. Home was always home.

"This is realization," Roshi said softly. "Not achieving enlightenment—discovering you were always enlightened. Buddha-nature was never lost. You just couldn't see it while seeking. Picture Nine is understanding: the ox was always you. The journey was returning to where you never left. Home was always here."

Kenji felt something crack in his chest. Home. The word resonated strangely. Antarctica—home he'd fled. Seeking home somewhere else. What if home was something different? Not place but presence? Not destination but being fully here?

**Picture Ten: Entering the Marketplace with Gift-Bestowing Hands**

Laughing Buddha figure enters a marketplace. Big belly, huge smile, carrying a bag of gifts. The enlightened person returns to ordinary world. Not staying in mountain monastery. Coming down to help others. Teaching naturally. Giving gifts of wisdom, compassion, presence. The journey completes by returning to beginning—but transformed.

"This is final stage," Roshi said. "Not solitary enlightenment. Compassionate action. Teaching others. Helping others wake up. Entering marketplace means: return to normal life but with gift of presence. Share what you learned. Help others journey from Picture One to Picture Ten. The cycle continues."

The scroll was rolled up carefully. The teaching complete. Ten pictures. One journey. Seeking to gifting. Lost to home.

Roshi looked at the assembled students. "Questions?"

---

Kenji raised his hand. His heart was pounding.

"Roshi, I've been practicing seventeen months. Studying Buddhism, sitting zazen, reading sutras. I understand the teachings intellectually—impermanence, no-self, suffering. But I can't *feel* it. Can't embody it." He gestured at the scroll. "Like these pictures: I understand all ten stages perfectly. I can see the progression clearly. But I'm stuck in Picture Two, maybe glimpsing Picture Three occasionally. How do I cross from understanding to actual realization?"

Several monks nodded—they had the same question.

Roshi looked at Kenji for a long moment. Then: "What picture do you think you're on?"

"Picture Two. I've found the traces. I understand intellectually. Maybe glimpsing Picture Three sometimes—moments where I almost get it. But I can't stay there."

"Wrong."

Kenji blinked. "I'm sorry?"

"You're not on Picture Two." Roshi's voice was gentle but firm. "You're still on Picture One."

The words landed like a blow. Kenji felt his face flush. "But I've been practicing seventeen months. I understand the teachings. I've read—"

"Picture One is seeking the ox," Roshi interrupted quietly. "You're still seeking. What you think are traces—intellectual understanding, sutra knowledge, meditation technique—these aren't traces. These are thoughts *about* traces. You're analyzing footprints instead of following them. You're studying maps instead of walking."

Kenji sat back, stunned. Still Picture One? After seventeen months?

"Then how do I move from Picture One to Picture Two?" His voice came out frustrated. "What am I doing wrong?"

"That question IS Picture One." Roshi smiled slightly. "Seeking the method of seeking. Wanting technique to stop seeking. You're trapped in recursive loop: seeking how to stop seeking how to stop seeking."

"So what do I do?"

"Stop asking what to do." Roshi paused. "Picture Two happens when you stop trying to find it. When practice becomes just practice, not practice-to-get-somewhere. When zazen is just sitting, not sitting-to-achieve-enlightenment. When you water the garden to water the garden, not to become enlightened gardener. Then: traces appear naturally. Not before."

Kenji heard this. Understood it intellectually. Immediately thought: *So I need to stop trying. I need to practice without goal. I need to—*

Then he caught himself. *I'm doing it again. Meta-cognition as obstacle. Analyzing the solution becomes the problem.*

The frustration was overwhelming. He could *see* the trap. Could articulate it perfectly. But seeing the trap didn't free him from it. Understanding the problem wasn't solving the problem.

Roshi was watching him. "You see your own mind now. Good. That's honest. Picture One is being honestly lost. Better than pretending you're further along."

"How long will I be on Picture One?"

"Different for everyone. Maybe six more months. Maybe six more years. Maybe until death. Regardless of asteroid." Roshi's voice was matter-of-fact. "But Picture One honestly practiced is valid practice. Being present to being lost is also presence. Don't skip ahead in your mind. Be where you are."

The teaching ended. Monks dispersed to morning work assignments. Kenji sat on his cushion, staring at the space where the scroll had been.

Still Picture One. After seventeen months. Still just seeking. Still lost.

---

That afternoon, Kenji walked with Yumi—fellow student, twenty-eight years old, been at the monastery four years. They followed the path through the forest outside the monastery grounds. Frost crunched underfoot. Winter bare branches against grey sky.

"Roshi told me I'm still on Picture One," Kenji said.

"That's honest of him." Yumi's breath was visible in the cold.

"You've been here four years. What picture are you on?"

"Some days, Picture Two. Some days, Picture One. Some days I don't know." She paused by a frozen stream. "The pictures aren't linear like we think. You don't climb them like stairs—one, two, three, four. You spiral through them. Touch Picture Three, fall back to Picture One, glimpse Picture Five, crash to Picture Two. That's practice."

"When does it stop being chaos?"

"Maybe Picture Six. Or maybe never. I don't know—I haven't reached Picture Six yet." Yumi smiled. "But here's what I learned: the pictures aren't destinations. They're descriptions. They don't tell you what to achieve. They show you where you are. That's enough."

"Is it?" Kenji stopped walking. "I came to Japan to learn how to face mortality. How to live knowing everyone dies in thirteen years. Seventeen months here and I'm no closer to that understanding."

"Maybe you're asking the wrong question." Yumi turned to face him. "Not 'how to face mortality' but 'how to be present with mortality.' Different question. Different practice."

"What's the difference?"

"Facing implies confrontation. Opposition. Mortality as enemy to defeat or overcome. Being present with mortality means: accepting it's here. Being with it. Not fighting. Not achieving victory over it. Just: living fully in the time that exists."

Kenji considered this. The ox-herding pictures described a journey from seeking to presence. From lost to home. But home wasn't a destination reached through effort—it was source returned to. Always already here. Just: obscured by seeking.

He understood this intellectually.

It didn't help.

"I think I need to leave Tokyo," he said. "Try a different approach. Maybe Western philosophy—Stoicism instead of Buddhism. Or just accept I'm not capable of this transformation."

"Or stay on Picture One and practice Picture One." Yumi started walking again. "You think Picture One is failure. It's not. It's the beginning. Everyone starts there. Most people never leave. Being honestly on Picture One is advanced practice compared to pretending you're somewhere else."

They walked in silence. The forest held its winter stillness. Kenji's mind spun through the pictures—One through Ten, the complete journey, perfectly mapped. And he was on Picture One. Still seeking. Still lost. Still analyzing instead of being.

Maybe that was okay. Maybe being present to Picture One was the actual practice. Not achieving Picture Two but being fully present to being lost.

That felt like defeat.

But also—strangely—like acceptance.

That night, Kenji wrote to his mother:

*Mom,*

*Year 2, Month 11 from Tokyo. Seventeen months at this monastery. I learned something today called the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures. Ancient Zen teaching—ten stages from lost to enlightened. I'm going to explain them because they're beautiful and because writing to you helps me process.*

*Picture One: Seeking the Ox. Boy completely lost, searching desperately. The ox—representing enlightenment, understanding, true nature—is nowhere. This was me Year 1, Month 6. This is still me now.*

*Picture Two: Finding the Traces. Boy sees footprints. Intellectual understanding. Reading sutras, learning techniques, knowing the path exists. I thought I was here. Roshi says no—still just seeking.*

*Picture Three: Glimpsing the Ox. Seeing it briefly but can't hold onto it. Moments of clarity that vanish. Haven't reached this yet.*

*Picture Four: Catching the Ox. The ox fights. Struggle to hold onto understanding. Hardest stage. Practice becomes real work. Can't imagine reaching this.*

*Picture Five: Taming the Ox. Still effort but cooperation emerging. Practice working. Integration beginning.*

*Picture Six: Riding the Ox Home. Effortless practice. The boy plays flute while riding. Ready to teach others. Joyful.*

*Picture Seven: Ox Forgotten, Self Alone. Teaching so internalized it becomes invisible. Natural presence without technique.*

*Picture Eight: Both Ox and Self Forgotten. Empty circle. Pure presence. Cannot be described.*

*Picture Nine: Returning to the Source. Understanding home was always here. Never left. The journey was discovering you never went anywhere. (This one is you, Mom. You've been home this whole time. Showing up every day. Living Picture Nine without knowing it.)*

*Picture Ten: Entering the Marketplace with Gift-Bestowing Hands. Teaching others. Compassion. Helping people. Returning to ordinary world with gifts of wisdom.*

*The teaching is perfect. Maps exactly the journey I'm trying to make—from seeking answers about mortality to being present with mortality. But here's the problem: Roshi says I'm still on Picture One. All my understanding is just thoughts about understanding, not actual understanding.*

*It's like this: Imagine you wanted to learn swimming. You could read books about swimming, study stroke mechanics, watch videos, understand hydrodynamics perfectly. But until you get in the water, you can't swim. I'm reading books about swimming. Analyzing stroke technique. Taking notes on buoyancy. Roshi is saying: just get in the water. But I don't know how to stop studying and start doing.*

*The hardest part? I understand the meta-problem. I see that seeing the problem is part of the problem. But seeing that doesn't fix it. It just adds another layer of understanding-without-being.*

*Maybe I need to leave Tokyo. Try a different approach. Cairo has Stoic philosophy communities—Western thinking instead of Eastern practice. Or Mumbai has meditation centers with different techniques. I don't know. Seventeen months here felt like progress. Today I learned it was mostly just elaborate seeking.*

*How are you? How's the campaign? Year 2 election is Month 9—you'll know results by the time you get this letter. Did you win? Part of me wants to come home. Support you. Be family instead of seeker. But I can't. Not yet. Haven't found what I'm seeking. Or learned how to stop seeking. Whichever comes first.*

*Love you. Miss you. Thank you for the funding and for reading these rambling letters. I read your letters when everything feels impossible. Which is often.*

*Your seeking son,*  
*Kenji*

He sealed the letter and left it for the morning mail transport.

---

Before sleep, Kenji returned to the teaching hall. The scroll was stored now, but he could picture it clearly. He sat on a cushion in the empty hall, lamplight flickering, and mentally walked through the images.

Picture One: Boy lost, arms wide, searching everywhere. That was him. Year 1 to now. Still seeking. Still lost. Still not even finding traces yet.

Picture Two: Boy studying ground, seeing footprints. Kenji thought intellectual understanding was traces. But Roshi said no—understanding *about* the path wasn't the same as being on the path. What were real traces then? He didn't know.

Picture Three: Glimpsing the ox. Moments of actual presence. He'd had maybe seventeen of them in seventeen months. Seventeen breaths where he wasn't thinking about breathing, just breathing. Seventeen moments of actual sitting instead of sitting-about-sitting. Was that Picture Three? Or still Picture One? He didn't know.

Pictures Four and Five: The struggle. Catching and taming. The long middle where practice was hard but progress happened. Kenji couldn't imagine reaching this. The ox wasn't even visible yet. How could he catch what he couldn't see?

Pictures Six and Seven: Riding home, ox forgotten. These seemed mythical. Impossible. Like stories from different species. Humans couldn't reach this. Could they?

Picture Eight: The empty circle. No boy, no ox, nothing. Complete presence without subject or object. Kenji stared at where the scroll had been, imagining the brushstroke circle. What did it feel like to be that empty? That complete? That present? He had no reference point. No experience even touching it.

Picture Nine: Returning to the source. Cherry blossoms and stream. The teaching said: this was always here. You never left home. Just couldn't see it while seeking.

Home.

That word again. What was home? Antarctica—the place he'd fled? Or something else? Something about presence itself being home? Being fully where you are, that's home?

His mother was home. She'd never left. Showed up every day to bear witness. That was Picture Nine—understanding you're already where you need to be. Elena Torres had never studied these pictures but she was living them. Advanced practice disguised as simple persistence.

Picture Ten: The marketplace. Laughing Buddha with bag of gifts. Enlightened teacher returning to help others. Teaching naturally. Compassionate action. The journey completing by returning to beginning—but transformed.

Would Kenji ever reach Picture Ten? Would seventeen more months, or the full thirteen years until extinction, be enough? Or would he die on Picture One, still seeking, still lost, still analyzing the footprints he couldn't even properly see?

The lamp flickered. Outside, wind moved through winter trees.

Kenji sat in the empty hall and felt: frustration, despair, small hope, exhaustion, determination, failure, acceptance. All tangled together. All real. All part of Picture One.

Being present to being lost. That was practice too. Roshi said so. Being honestly on Picture One was valid. Better than pretending to be on Picture Three.

Okay. He was on Picture One. Seventeen months and still just seeking. That was where he actually was. Could he accept that? Be present to that? Stop trying to force himself forward and just: be here, lost, seeking, struggling?

For about seventeen breaths, he was simply present to Picture One. Not trying to move forward. Not analyzing. Just: being lost honestly.

Then his mind returned: *Was that it? Was that Picture Two? Did traces just appear?*

And the moment was gone. Back to seeking. Back to Picture One.

But: seventeen breaths. That was something. Seventeen breaths of presence that hadn't existed before. In seventeen months, seventeen breaths of actual practice. Terrible ratio. But also: seventeen breaths more than nothing.

Maybe that was the traces Roshi meant. Not permanent understanding. Just: moments. Brief glimpses. Seventeen breaths at a time. The ox glimpsed for seventeen breaths then lost again. That's Picture Three maybe. Or Picture One-and-a-half. Somewhere between pure seeking and actually finding traces.

Seventeen breaths. Seventeen months. Thirteen years left until extinction. All temporary. All complete in its own way. All of it: opportunity to practice presence to whichever picture he was actually on.

Maybe that was enough. Maybe that was the real teaching. Every picture is complete in itself. Picture One isn't failure—it's where he actually is. And being present to Picture One IS practice. Even if he never reaches Picture Two.

Even if he dies on Picture One—still seeking, still lost—if he's honestly present to that seeking, that's valid practice. That counts. That matters.

The teaching wasn't about achieving Picture Ten. The teaching was about being present to whichever picture you're actually on. Being there completely. Honestly. Without pretense.

Kenji stood slowly. His legs were stiff from sitting on cold floor. He bowed to the empty space where the scroll had been.

Picture One continuing. Seeking continuing. Seventeen more months maybe. Or thirteen more years. Being lost continuing. But: present to the lostness. Honest about the seeking. Practicing Picture One fully instead of pretending to be on Picture Two.

That would have to be enough. For tonight. For tomorrow. For however long Picture One lasted.

He walked back to his room through the cold monastery corridors. Winter settling deeper. His seventeenth month ending. His seeking continuing.

But something had shifted. Infinitesimally small. Not enlightenment. Not breakthrough. Not even progress really. Just: acceptance of where he actually was. Slight decrease in suffering from fighting reality. Slight increase in presence to what is rather than what should be.

That was something. That was practice. That was Picture One honestly lived.

Tomorrow: more zazen. More study. More maintenance work in the garden. More seeking. More Picture One. But present to it. Accepting it. Being there fully.

The ox was still lost. The boy was still searching. The journey had barely begun.

But the journey was also already complete. Picture One fully lived was also Picture Ten. Beginning and end the same. Home never lost. Just: couldn't see it yet.

Seventeen breaths at a time. That's all anyone got. That would have to be enough.

It was enough.

For tonight.

For now.
