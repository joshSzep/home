# Chapter 18: Wandering

**Kenji Torres | Year 5, Month 9 | Mumbai**

---

The meditation hall smelled of incense and sweat.

Forty people sitting zazen. Dawn light filtering through latticed windows. Silence broken only by breathing. Kenji sat in the third row, legs crossed, back straight, mind anywhere but present.

Fifth month at the ashram. Fifth month seeking. Still seeking.

His mind wandered—always wandered. Supposed to focus on breath. In, out. Simple. Impossible. Instead: thinking about the technique of focusing. Analyzing the practice. Evaluating whether it was working. Meta-awareness that prevented actual awareness. Gap between intellectual understanding and embodied experience. He knew the gap existed. Couldn't cross it.

The bell rang. Meditation ended. Forty people stood, bowed, dispersed. Kenji unfolded his legs—they'd gone numb again. Poor circulation from sitting incorrectly. Poor form from thinking too much about form. Everything in his practice was like this: understanding the mechanics, missing the essence.

Outside, Mumbai morning was beginning. Year 5 of the apocalypse. The city looked normal—or as normal as anywhere looked now. People walked to work. Vendors set up stalls. Traffic moved through reconfigured streets. The mundane persistence of life in the face of guaranteed death. Kenji watched it every morning, still unable to integrate the contradiction.

"You're thinking again."

Yuki sat beside him on the ashram steps. Twenty-nine years old, Japanese, intensely committed to enlightenment before the end. She'd arrived at the ashram Year 4, dedicated herself completely. Meditated six hours daily. Studied sutras. Practiced with single-minded focus.

"I'm always thinking," Kenji admitted.

"That's your problem."

"I know. Knowing is also my problem."

Yuki smiled—rare expression for her. "Meta-cognition as obstacle. Classic."

They sat watching the city wake. The ashram was Hindu-Buddhist hybrid, accommodating both traditions and neither fully. Mix of monastics and temporary seekers. Some like Yuki—pursuing enlightenment desperately. Others like Kenji—pursuing understanding without knowing what understanding meant.

"Do you think you'll get there?" Kenji asked. "Enlightenment before the end?"

"I have to believe I will. Otherwise why practice?"

"To practice. To have something to do. To fill time meaningfully."

"That's not enough for me." Yuki's voice was quiet but fierce. "I want liberation. Real freedom from suffering. If I die without achieving that, everything was wasted."

Kenji heard the desperation. Understood it. Felt it differently. Yuki sought enlightenment as escape. Kenji sought understanding as purpose. Different goals, same futility. Probably.

"How long will you stay?" she asked.

"Don't know. Until I'm ready to leave. Or until leaving finds me."

"That's very Zen."

"That's very indecisive."

Yuki laughed. "Same thing, sometimes."

---

Breakfast was communal. Sixty people in dining hall. Vegetarian food prepared by rotating crews. Kenji ate mechanically—tasted nothing, appreciated nothing, just: fueled the body. Another item on his list of failures: couldn't be present even with eating.

Father Tomás sat across from him. Fifty-five years old, Brazilian, former Catholic priest. His faith had shattered Year 1—"How can I worship a God who lets everyone die?"—and he'd spent four years searching for replacement belief. Tried Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, secular philosophy. Found pieces in each, whole in none.

"Sleep well?" Tomás asked. His English carried Portuguese rhythm.

"Same as always. You?"

"Dreamed about my old church. The congregation. I told them mass was cancelled permanently due to apocalypse." He smiled sadly. "Even in dreams, the comedy persists."

Kenji liked Tomás—gentle, confused, honest about confusion. No pretense of having answers. No performance of wisdom. Just: searching with full awareness that searching might be futile.

"Have you heard from home?" Tomás asked.

"Letter from my mother yesterday. Things in Antarctica are stable. Population declining but systems holding. She's still governing."

"And that helps you? Knowing she's doing her work while you do yours?"

"I don't know if I'm doing work. I'm traveling. Looking. Not finding."

"Looking is work. Being willing to not-find takes courage."

Kenji considered this. Year 2, he'd left Antarctica thinking: I'll find answers out here. Truth about how to live the ending. Some wisdom tradition that handles mortality perfectly. Five months in Mumbai had taught him: no perfect answers exist. Or they exist but remain inaccessible. Or they're accessible but not helpful. Or they're helpful but he's broken in ways that prevent help from landing.

"I'm going to Lagos," he said suddenly. Hadn't known he'd decided until words emerged.

Tomás looked surprised. "When?"

"Soon. Maybe next month."

"Why Lagos?"

"My cousin's there. Zara. She has two kids—Maya and Kofi. And there's this philosopher. Professor Wei. Very old. My mother writes about her sometimes. Correspondence they share. Wei teaches presence, impermanence, acceptance. I want to meet her."

"You could learn that here."

"I've been here five months. Haven't learned it yet."

Tomás nodded slowly. "So: more seeking. Different location."

"Maybe the seeking itself is the point."

"Or maybe the seeking is avoidance."

The words landed hard. Kenji stared at his breakfast. Tomás continued gently: "I do the same thing. Travel, study, practice. Always moving. If I stopped moving, I'd have to feel everything I'm avoiding. So: seeking as defense mechanism."

"Is that wrong?"

"I don't know. Wrong implies moral judgment. This just: is. We're doing what we can. Maybe that's enough."

Maybe. Kenji finished eating. Tomás left for morning sutras. Kenji stayed, staring at empty plate, thinking about avoidance versus seeking versus both being true simultaneously.

---

Afternoons were work period. Ashram required four hours daily labor—cooking, cleaning, gardening, maintenance. Kenji usually chose garden. Something about being outside, hands in soil, growing things that wouldn't outlast the asteroid. Futile cultivation. Perfect metaphor.

Today he worked beside Amina. Twenty-four years old, Egyptian, philosopher studying Stoicism with academic rigor. She'd arrived at the ashram two weeks ago, approaching Eastern practice like dissertation research. Took notes during meditation. Analyzed sutras structurally. Understood everything intellectually, felt nothing emotionally.

Kenji recognized himself in her immediately.

They weeded in silence. Eventually Amina said: "This is absurd."

"Gardening?"

"Growing vegetables for people who'll die before these plants reach maturity. The tomatoes will outlive us."

"So?"

"So it's objectively meaningless. We're performing purpose."

Kenji pulled another weed. "Is performed purpose less real than authentic purpose?"

"Yes. Obviously."

"I'm not sure. If the performance helps us survive—psychologically, I mean—then it's functional. Function is meaning."

"That's pragmatism, not truth."

"Maybe they're the same thing."

Amina stopped weeding. Looked at him. "You don't believe that."

She was right. He didn't. But he wanted to. Wanted to believe that seeking was meaningful even when finding was impossible. That traveling taught something even when destination proved illusory. That performing purpose created real purpose through the act of performance.

"I'm leaving next month," he said.

"Where?"

"Lagos."

"Why?"

"There's a philosopher there. Very old. Teaches presence and impermanence. I want to meet her before she dies."

"So: more seeking."

"Yes."

"You know she won't have answers either."

"Probably not."

"But you're going anyway."

"Yes."

Amina returned to weeding. "I understand that. I'm doing the same thing. Came here thinking: ashram will have wisdom. Two weeks in: nothing I didn't already know intellectually. But I'll stay another month. Then somewhere else. Always seeking. Never finding. It's exhausting."

"What's the alternative?"

"Stopping. Accepting. Being present with not-knowing."

"Can you do that?"

"No. Can you?"

"No."

They worked in silence. Two seekers, intellectually brilliant, emotionally frozen, gardening vegetables they'd never eat. The absurdity was complete. The absurdity was everything.

---

Evening study was optional. Kenji attended anyway—structure helped. Tonight: discussion on the Dhammapada, led by the ashram's senior teacher. Forty people in meditation hall, now configured with cushions in circle.

The teacher was seventy years old, Indian, with teaching manner that oscillated between profound and inscrutable. He read verse 277: "All conditioned things are impermanent. When one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering."

Discussion opened. Yuki spoke first: "How do we develop that wisdom? How do we really see impermanence, not just understand it intellectually?"

The teacher smiled. "You practice. Every day. Every moment. Eventually understanding deepens into embodiment."

"How long does that take?"

"As long as it takes. There is no schedule."

"But we have ten years!" Yuki's frustration broke through. "Ten years until everyone dies. That's not enough time for gradual enlightenment."

"Then perhaps gradual enlightenment is not the path. Perhaps sudden realization. Perhaps no realization at all. Perhaps accepting non-attainment is the attainment."

The words were classic non-dual teaching. Kenji had heard variations a hundred times across five months. They never helped. Just: confused him more. Either truth existed and could be accessed, or it didn't exist and seeking was futile, or truth was paradox and human cognition couldn't grasp it. All three options felt true and impossible simultaneously.

Father Tomás raised his hand. "Teacher, what if we can't accept impermanence? What if we rage against it? Is that wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong. Rage is also practice. Grief is practice. Confusion is practice. You feel what you feel. Don't add second arrow of judgment."

"But I want peace. I want to stop suffering. That's why I'm here."

"Peace is not absence of suffering. Peace is acceptance of suffering. Different thing entirely."

Kenji listened to the exchange. Tomás seeking peace. Teacher offering acceptance. The gap between them unbridgeable. Like all gaps here. Between intellectual understanding and emotional integration. Between knowing about presence and being present. Between studying Buddhism and becoming Buddhist.

After class, walking back to dormitories, Tomás caught up with him. "Does any of this help you?"

"The teaching?"

"Any of it. The ashram. The practice. The seeking."

Kenji considered honestly. "It gives me structure. Something to do. People to be around who are asking same questions. That helps. But actual answers? Actual transformation? No. Not yet."

"Maybe that comes later."

"Maybe. Or maybe I'm constitutionally unable to access it. Maybe my brain is too analytical. Too Western. Too damaged by academic training."

"Or maybe you're exactly where you need to be."

"That's Buddhist optimism."

"No, that's just: true. You're here. Now. This is exactly where you are. That's definitional."

Kenji laughed. "Tautology as wisdom."

"Sometimes wisdom is tautological."

They reached the dormitories. Separated to respective rooms. Kenji lay on his mat—simple bedding, shared room with five others. Listened to night sounds. Mumbai traffic distant. Other seekers breathing. His own thoughts spiraling.

He pulled up his wrist display. Message from Elena, sent yesterday:

*Mijo—*

*Year 5, Month 8 from Antarctica. Population at 1.9 billion now. Down from 4.2 billion at detection. Infrastructure holding at minimal levels. I govern meetings attended by five people in rooms designed for thirty. Democratic legitimacy becomes question mark—Year 6 election approaching, unclear if anyone will oppose me. Marcus Rivera says people trust my witness more than my power. Strange shift: authority through presence rather than votes.*

*Professor Wei writes to me regularly now. Her letters are brief, clear, profound. She says governance without outcomes is still governance. That showing up when powerless is the whole work. I'm beginning to understand that. Not accept—understanding and acceptance are different. But: understand.*

*Zara sent photos of Maya and Kofi. Your cousin's children are beautiful. Maya is nearly eight now—serious, brilliant. Kofi is almost five—joyful, innocent. Zara is defiant mother, raising children she knows will die young. That defiance is everything. That choice to love what will end—maybe that's the teaching.*

*Come home when you're ready. Or stay abroad. Or keep wandering. Whatever you need. Ten years left—spend them searching if searching helps. Just: stay alive. Stay connected. Let me know you're okay sometimes.*

*I love you. I'm proud of you. Even when you feel lost, you're finding something. I don't know what yet. But something.*

*— Mom*

Kenji read it twice. His mother, most powerful human on Earth, learning philosophy from letters. Governing with presence instead of power. Bearing witness to civilization's collapse. While he wandered ashrams, unable to meditate properly, seeking answers he couldn't define.

Were they doing the same work? Elena staying, Kenji traveling. Both trying to find meaning in the ending. Both failing and continuing. Both present with their respective practices even when those practices felt futile.

He started a reply:

*Mom—*

*Year 5, Month 9 from Mumbai. I'm at an ashram. Hindu-Buddhist hybrid. Lot of seekers here, all trying to figure out how to live the ending. We meditate. Study. Talk in circles mostly. I understand intellectually what they're teaching—impermanence, acceptance, presence. Can't feel it yet. Emotional integration seems impossible. But I'm trying.*

*Met some interesting people. Yuki—Japanese woman desperately seeking enlightenment. Father Tomás—Brazilian priest whose faith shattered. Amina—Egyptian philosopher as emotionally frozen as me. We're all performing seeking. Don't know if it's authentic or avoidance. Maybe both.*

*Professor Wei writes to you? I'd like to meet her. Zara mentions her sometimes—neighbor, teacher, 118 years old. Planning to go to Lagos soon. Want to learn from her directly before she dies. Or before I'm too closed off to learn. Whichever comes first.*

*I think about you a lot. You governing a dying city. Me wandering dying cities. Both of us trying to find meaning in collapse. Maybe we're doing the same work from different angles. Or maybe I'm just procrastinating while you're actually helping people. Hard to tell.*

*Love you. Miss you. Will come home eventually. Just: not ready yet. Need to exhaust the seeking before I can stop seeking. Does that make sense?*

*— Kenji*

He sent it. Immediately felt the familiar inadequacy—words never captured what he meant. Never bridged the distance. But they were something. Connection attempt. That mattered, probably.

---

Week three of Month 9. Kenji sat with Yuki after morning meditation. She'd been crying—rare for her. Allowed herself emotional expression even more rarely than Kenji.

"What happened?" he asked.

"I've been here eighteen months. Practicing intensely. Six hours of meditation daily. Sutras memorized. Teachers consulted. And I'm exactly where I started. No enlightenment. No liberation. No breakthrough."

"Maybe breakthrough isn't goal."

"It has to be! Otherwise what am I doing? Ten years until everyone dies. If I don't achieve liberation before then, I've wasted everything."

"Or you've practiced something valuable even without achieving end goal."

"That's consolation prize. That's participation trophy. I want real attainment."

Kenji understood. He wanted that too—real transformation, not just: understanding that transformation would be nice. Wanted to be present, not just know about presence. Wanted to accept impermanence, not just study acceptance.

"What if attainment is impossible?" he asked gently.

"Then seeking is futile."

"Does futile seeking have value?"

Yuki looked at him. Eyes red. Face exhausted. "I don't know. You tell me. You've been seeking three years. Tokyo, here, wherever you go next. Has it helped?"

Kenji sat with the question. Had it helped? He'd learned things—practices, philosophies, perspectives. Met people. Gained intellectual framework for the ending. But: transformation? Actual change? Peace?

"It's given me something to do," he said finally. "Structure. Purpose. Company with others asking same questions. That's not nothing."

"But it's not enlightenment."

"No. It's not enlightenment."

They sat in silence. Two seekers, practicing futility, continuing anyway. Maybe that was the teaching. Maybe the seeking itself was the practice, regardless of attainment. Maybe showing up to meditation even when meditation didn't work was the whole point.

Or maybe that was just: rationalization for failure.

---

Year 5, Month 10 arrived. Kenji decided: time to leave. Five months was long enough. He'd learned what the ashram could teach him—which was mostly: he couldn't learn what the ashram was teaching. Gap too wide. Mind too analytical. Something broken in him that prevented embodiment.

He told the senior teacher his plans.

"Where will you go?" the teacher asked.

"Lagos. There's a philosopher there. Very old. I want to meet her."

"And you think she will have answers we don't?"

"No. But maybe different questions."

The teacher smiled. "That's wise. Different questions often more valuable than different answers."

"Or maybe I'm just running."

"Running toward and running away can be same movement. Direction matters less than quality of presence during the running."

Kenji bowed. Thanked the teacher. Packed his few belongings—clothing, tablet, journal. Nothing else. He'd learned to travel light. Material simplicity even when mental complexity remained overwhelming.

Goodbyes were brief. Yuki: "Find what you're looking for." Tomás: "Or don't find it. Either is okay." Amina: "Let me know if Lagos helps. I might go there after here."

Before leaving, one last encounter. Kenji found Marcus Reyes at the children's center—small building on ashram grounds where refugees taught local kids. Reyes had been there three years, teaching English and basic science.

They'd met twice before in Antarctica—brief conversations, mutual recognition. Kenji respected Reyes' choice to leave power for presence. Wanted to hear his perspective on seeking.

"Did you find it?" Kenji asked. "What you came here for?"

Reyes looked up from helping a seven-year-old with spelling. "Define 'it.'"

"Purpose. Peace. Whatever you were looking for when you left Antarctica."

Reyes considered. Forty years old now, calm in ways Kenji envied. "I found something. Not what I expected. I came to escape responsibility, to stop being defined by eight years of service. Found I couldn't escape. Service is part of me. So I teach children instead of governing mayors. Different service. Same nature."

"Does that feel like finding or failing?"

"Both. Neither." Reyes smiled slightly. "Your mother asks me the same questions in her letters. 'Are you happy? Did leaving work? Was it worth it?' I tell her: I'm present. That's different from happy but better than numb. Leaving was right. Being here is right. Eventually leaving here will be right too. Everything in its time."

"She writes to you?"

"Quarterly. I write back. We maintain connection without proximity. That's enough." Reyes studied Kenji. "You're leaving too. Going to Lagos?"

"To meet a Professor. Philosopher. Wei. Before she dies."

"Good. Wei's teaching might land better than ashram philosophy."

It seemed Reyes knew everyone. Kenji didn't ask how. Just accepted it.

Reyes continued. "Wei is more grounded. More practical. Less about achieving states, more about accepting what is." Reyes touched the boy's shoulder gently. "Spelling is good, Arjun. Keep going."

He turned back to Kenji. "Your mother loves you deeply. Worries about you constantly. When you're ready, go home. Not for her—for you. The seeking is valuable. But so is returning. I left Antarctica three years ago. Haven't gone back. Maybe won't. But I think about it. Think about showing up one last time before the end. Being there with people I served. Maybe you'll feel the same. Maybe not. Just: don't let pride keep you away if returning is what you need."

Kenji felt unexpected emotion. "Thank you."

"Travel well. Learn what you can. Send regards to Wei from me—I've read her letters to your mother. She's remarkable."

On his last evening, Kenji sat in the meditation hall alone. Forty cushions empty. Incense burned down to ash. Mumbai sounds filtering through latticed windows—traffic, voices, life continuing despite the countdown.

He closed his eyes. Tried to meditate. Tried to be present. Mind wandered immediately—thinking about Lagos, about Wei, about his mother, about the ten years remaining, about whether seeking was meaningful or just: addiction to motion.

After twenty minutes he opened his eyes. Still not present. Still analytical. Still broken in familiar ways.

But: he'd shown up. He'd tried. He'd spent five months practicing something he couldn't do well. That was worth something. Maybe not enlightenment. Maybe just: effort. Honest effort in the face of inadequacy.

Maybe that was enough.

---

The transport to Lagos departed early morning. Kenji watched Mumbai recede—sprawling city, climate-adapted, thriving despite apocalypse. Year 5 of the ending. People still lived. Still worked. Still sought meaning.

He was part of that seeking. One seeker among millions. Nothing special. Nothing profound. Just: another human trying to figure out how to live ten years.

The transport climbed. Sky opened. Earth curved below—beautiful, doomed, indifferent.

Kenji thought about Professor Wei. 118 years old. Spent lifetime practicing impermanence. Teaching presence. Offering wisdom to anyone who sought it. She was dying naturally—body failing while mind remained clear. Lucky death. Old death. The kind most humans wouldn't get.

What would she teach him? Same things the ashram taught, probably. Presence. Acceptance. Letting go. The gap between intellectual understanding and embodied experience. But: maybe hearing it from someone who'd actually embodied it would help.

Or maybe not. Maybe he'd arrive in Lagos, meet Wei, learn nothing new, move on to the next place. Another destination in endless seeking. Another stop on the wandering that defined his twenties.

Running toward or running away?

Both. Neither. The question itself was analytical trap. He was moving. That was the fact. Judging the movement as progress or avoidance—that was secondary interpretation. Maybe unnecessary interpretation.

He pulled up his tablet. Started another letter to Elena:

*Mom—*

*Leaving Mumbai. Going to Lagos. Want to meet Professor Wei before she dies. Before I'm too lost to learn. Before the seeking becomes pure avoidance.*

*Five months at ashram taught me: I understand impermanence intellectually but can't embody it. I know about presence but can't be present. I study acceptance but can't accept. Gap between knowing and being remains unbridgeable.*

*Is seeking futile? Probably. Am I continuing anyway? Yes. Because what else would I do? Seeking gives structure. Purpose. Something better than parties, better than destruction, better than nothing.*

*You wrote about governing with presence instead of power. I think I'm seeking with motion instead of arrival. Maybe parallel practices. You staying, me traveling. Both trying to make meaning in collapse.*

*Ten years left. I'll probably spend them wandering. Different cities. Different teachings. Same questions. Same failure to answer them. But: maybe the wandering is the point. Maybe seeking without finding is the practice. Maybe I'm exactly where I need to be, which is: lost.*

*Love you. See you eventually. Still alive. Still trying.*

*— Kenji*

He sent it. The transport continued west. Mumbai disappeared behind clouds. Ahead: Lagos. Professor Wei. His cousin Zara. Her children. Another destination. Another seeking.

Always seeking. Never arriving.

Maybe that was the teaching.

Kenji closed his eyes. Let the transport carry him. Felt the movement—artificial, mechanical, directional. Not meditation. Not presence. Just: motion through space. Body traveling while mind analyzed the traveling.

Ten years left. How many more cities? How many more teachers? How many more conversations about impermanence with people equally unable to accept it?

He didn't know. Couldn't know. The future was foreclosed—asteroid guaranteed. But the present remained open. Mysterious. Unknowable despite all his analysis.

Lagos next. Then: whatever came after Lagos. Then: whatever came after that.

Wandering until wandering exhausted itself. Seeking until seeking revealed its own futility. Running until running transformed into something else—arrival, acceptance, presence. Whatever those words meant.

The transport hummed. Kenji breathed. Year 5 continued. The seeking continued.

Everything continued because what else would it do?
