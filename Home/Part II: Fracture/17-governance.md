# Chapter 17: Governance

**Elena Torres | Year 4, Month 7 | Antarctic Megacity**

---

The morning briefing had become theater.

Elena knew this. Marcus knew this. Chen, Kowalski, and Dr. Ade knew this. They showed up anyway, five people in a conference room designed for thirty, maintaining the ritual of governance when governance barely existed.

7:00 AM. The same time for four years. Elena took her seat at the head of the table—same seat, same position, same responsibility that had hollowed her out and filled her back up with something harder to name than "purpose" but similar enough.

"Population report," she said, starting with Chen as always.

Chen pulled up his datapad. Sixty-two years old now, thin as wire, stubborn as bedrock. "Two point two billion as of this morning. Down from four point two billion at detection. Down from three point one billion last year. We're losing approximately fifteen percent population annually—some departure, mostly deaths."

Two point two billion. Elena wrote this in her notes. Old habit. The notes lived in a secure archive somewhere, categorized under "Historical Record" as if history would survive the asteroid. Someone at the archive still backed them up daily. Someone still believed documentation mattered.

Maybe they were right.

"Infrastructure," Elena prompted.

"Power grid at fifty-three percent capacity," Chen continued. "Water systems forty-eight percent. Waste management thirty-nine percent. Transport twenty-six percent. Communications holding at ninety-two percent—automation handles that. Everything else requires human maintenance we don't have."

Everything failing. Not catastrophically—not yet. Just: slowly. The megacity was like a body with failing organs, compensating until it couldn't, systems shutting down one by one in a process everyone could see but no one could stop.

"Security," Elena said.

Kowalski grimaced. He always grimaced now. Fifty-eight years old, former military, current witness to civilization's unraveling. "Crime stable at four hundred percent above baseline. Murder rate five hundred percent. Enforcement capacity at fifteen percent—we respond to maybe one in seven calls. The force is down to skeleton crew. People don't want to be police when police work ends in ten years."

"Recommendations?"

"Same as yesterday. Same as last year. We're doing what we can with what we have. It's not enough. It'll never be enough."

Elena nodded. Wrote this down too. Dr. Ade went next—health services report. Suicide rate plateaued but catastrophically high. Hospitals understaffed. Mental health services overwhelmed. Birth rate effectively zero. Death rate climbing. Two hundred thousand deaths last month in Antarctica alone.

Two hundred thousand. Elena felt the number settle. Four years ago it would have destroyed her. Now it was Thursday.

"Orders, Mayor?" Marcus Rivera asked gently.

Elena looked at her deputy mayor. Thirty-five years old, brilliant, pragmatic, committed. Three years ago he'd run against her, calling her governance "empty symbolism." Two years ago he'd conceded gracefully and offered to serve. Now he sat beside her every morning, helping bear a burden he'd once dismissed as theater.

"Same as yesterday," Elena said. Her voice was steady, practiced. "Maintain what we can. Document what we can't. Prioritize life-sustaining systems. Continue essential services as long as staffing allows. We keep showing up. That's the goal."

Chen and Kowalski nodded, collected their notes, left. Dr. Ade lingered a moment—"Take care of yourself, Mayor"—then followed. Marcus stayed. He always stayed.

"Four years," he said when they were alone.

"Four years," Elena confirmed.

"Eleven more."

"Eleven more."

They sat in the too-large room, two people governing a dying city, and didn't talk about futility. Didn't need to. After three years working together, they'd developed their own language of silences.

Marcus pulled up his tablet. "I've been thinking about Year 6."

Year 6. The election. Elena's second term ended in just over two years—Year 6, Month 9 if they followed the same schedule as last time. Democratic protocol required elections every four years. She'd insisted on it Year 2—"If we abandon democracy, we abandon everything that made us human." Voters had agreed, barely. 61-39. Legitimate mandate. Hollow victory. Democratic extinction.

"Will anyone run against you?" Marcus asked.

"I don't know. Will you?"

He looked startled. "No. God, no. I tried that once. Lost. Learned my lesson."

"What lesson?"

"That witness matters. That symbolic governance isn't empty. That showing up is everything when showing up is all we have." He met her eyes. "You taught me that. I want to help you do it, not fight you over philosophy."

Elena felt unexpected warmth. Marcus Rivera, her former opponent, her current deputy, the person who understood her work better than anyone except maybe Wei. "Thank you for staying."

"Thank you for letting me stay."

They worked in companionable silence—Marcus handling practical resource distribution, Elena reviewing policy documents that felt increasingly abstract. At 10 AM, Marcus gathered his materials and headed to his office. Elena sat alone in the conference room, staring at her notes.

Two point two billion. Infrastructure failing. Systems collapsing. Crime overwhelming. Deaths accelerating. Her power was supposed to fix these things. She was mayor. Most powerful human on Earth—or had been, before the power pyramid inverted. Now everyone above her was dead or fled or powerless, and Elena governed ruins.

Not ruins. That was too dramatic. The megacity still functioned. Lights still turned on most mornings. Water still flowed from most taps. Transit ran on reduced schedule. People went to work, bought food, raised children—fewer children, doomed children, but children nonetheless.

Order persisted. Because she showed up. Because Chen showed up. Because Kowalski, Dr. Ade, Marcus, and fifty thousand other public servants across Antarctica still came to work, still maintained systems, still governed the dying.

That had to mean something.

---

Her office was quiet. Elena kept the window shades open—a view of the Antarctic megacity stretching to the horizon. Billions of lives. Temporary lights. All of it ending in eleven years, vaporized by physics she couldn't negotiate with.

She pulled up her personal messages. Kenji had written.

*Mom—*

*Year 4, Month 6 from Mumbai. I'm at an ashram now. Hindu-Buddhist hybrid. Lot of seekers here, all trying to figure out how to live the ending. We meditate. Study. Talk in circles mostly. I understand intellectually what they're teaching—impermanence, acceptance, presence. Can't feel it yet. Emotional integration seems impossible. But I'm trying.*

*Met someone interesting. Father Tomás—Brazilian priest whose faith shattered. Came here looking for replacement belief system. We talk sometimes about loss. Loss of future, loss of meaning, loss of faith. He asks if I miss academia. I say yes but dishonestly. What I miss: certainty. Answers. The feeling that intellectual work mattered. Can't access that anymore.*

*Professor Wei writes to me sometimes. You know her teaching has spread everywhere? People call her the "philosopher of the ending." She says governance without outcomes is still governance. That your work matters precisely because it can't save anyone. That witness is purpose. Does that help you? Does it help me? I don't know yet.*

*I think about you a lot. You governing a dying city. Me wandering dying cities. Both of us trying to find meaning in collapse. Maybe we're doing the same work from different angles. Or maybe I'm just procrastinating while you're actually helping people. Hard to tell.*

*Love you. Come home sometimes if you can. I mean if you want to. No pressure. You have work.*

*— Kenji*

Elena read it twice. Her son was twenty-eight now. Nearly three years into his wandering. Still lost. Still seeking. Still alive, which was something. The parties had stopped, or at least the desperate obliteration had slowed. Progress. Maybe.

His last letter—Year 2, Month 11—had mentioned something called "ox-herding pictures." Zen teaching about seeking and finding. He'd explained all ten stages with perfect intellectual clarity, then admitted he was still lost at stage one. Elena understood that feeling: governing through collapse, documenting witness no one would read, showing up to empty rooms. Maybe she was seeking something too. Or maybe, like Kenji's teaching suggested, being present to being lost was enough.

She started a reply:

*Mijo—*

*I'm glad you're in Mumbai. Glad you're seeking, even if finding seems impossible. Maybe seeking IS the answer. Maybe there's no destination, just: the practice of looking.*

*Professor Wei writes to me too, through your letters mostly. Her philosophy spreads like seeds—I see it everywhere now. In Marcus's understanding. In Chen's persistence. In the way Dr. Ade keeps showing up to tend the dying. We're all practicing presence without knowing that's what we're doing.*

*Does Wei's teaching help me? Yes. Not the way answers help. More the way company helps. Knowing someone else sees what I'm doing. Sees that it matters even when it accomplishes nothing. That's enough most days.*

*You asked if we're doing the same work. I think yes. You're bearing witness to how people face the end. I'm bearing witness to how civilization faces the end. Both necessary. Both impossible. Both worth doing.*

*I love you. I'm proud of you. Come home if you want, stay abroad if that helps more. Whatever you need. Eleven years left—spend them however makes them bearable.*

*— Mom*

She sent it. Immediately wished she'd said more, said less, said differently. But the words were gone. That was always true. You spoke and the speaking was over and you couldn't take it back, couldn't perfect it, could only live with what you'd offered.

Two more letters waited to be written. One to Wei—weekly correspondence, five years now of philosophical exchange. One to Marcus Reyes—quarterly check-in, two years since he'd left for Mumbai.

She drafted the second quickly:

*Marcus—Year 4, Month 7. Still governing. Still showing up. Population down to 2.2 billion. Rivera asks why I continue. Same question you asked me Year 0, Month 2. Remember? "Why are we doing this?" I still don't have good answer. I just keep showing up. Is that enough? How are you? How is Mumbai? Still practicing? Still teaching children? Still finding yourself? I think of you often. Thank you for eight years of service. Thank you for leaving when leaving was right. That was gift. —E*

Brief. Honest. Maintaining connection to the person who'd witnessed her early transformation. His responses were always grounded—updates on his teaching, observations on presence practice, gratitude for their shared years. No philosophy, no advice. Just: friendly witness from distance.

She sent both letters. Would receive replies within the week. Her community of correspondence—philosopher, son, former assistant. All teaching her different things about presence, service, letting go.

---

11:00 AM. Marcus Rivera returned with lunch—two sandwiches, tea, the companionable efficiency of two years working side-by-side.

"Eat," he said. "You skip breakfast too often."

"How do you know I skipped breakfast?"

"I know everything. I'm deputy mayor. Omniscience is in the job description."

Elena smiled despite herself. Marcus had this effect—lightness when she needed it, seriousness when that was required. He'd learned to read her moods perfectly, calibrating his presence to what she needed rather than what he wanted to provide.

They ate in comfortable silence. Then Marcus said: "I've been thinking about Year 6. The election."

"You mentioned that."

"I mean: what if no one runs against you?"

Elena had considered this. Year 2, Marcus Rivera had provided opposition—legitimate democratic contest, genuine philosophical difference. But Year 6? Who would challenge her? Who wanted this burden? Who cared enough about governance to fight for it?

"Then I run unopposed," she said.

"Does that matter? Democratically?"

"I don't know. Democracy requires choice. One candidate isn't choice. But going through the ritual might matter anyway. Letting people vote. Letting them say: yes, continue. Or: no, step down. That's still meaningful."

"Even if the outcome is certain?"

"Especially then. When everything else is certain—the asteroid, the ending, the futility—giving people agency over something, even something symbolic, might matter."

Marcus nodded slowly. "You've thought about this."

"I think about everything. Curse of the office."

"And if you win unopposed? If no one challenges you? What does that mean?"

Elena stared at her half-eaten sandwich. "It means democratic legitimacy shifts. Year 2, I earned sixty-one percent. Voters chose me over you—real choice, real contest. Year 6, if no one opposes me, what do I earn? Not electoral mandate. Something else. Consent maybe. The city saying: fine, continue. We don't care enough to challenge you but we don't care enough to stop you either."

"That doesn't sound inspiring."

"It isn't. But it might be honest. I'll govern not because people chose me passionately but because no one else wanted the burden. That's democracy in the ending. Not enthusiasm. Acknowledgment."

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. Then: "Would you step down? If someone did challenge you?"

"You mean: am I clinging to power?"

"No. I mean: are you doing this because it matters or because it's all you have left?"

The question landed hard. Elena set down her sandwich. Looked at Marcus—earnest face, worried eyes, genuinely trying to understand.

"I don't know," she admitted. "Four years ago I knew. I governed because bearing witness mattered. Because maintaining dignity mattered. Because someone should show up. Now? Now I govern because it's Thursday. Because I don't know what else to do. Because stopping feels wrong even though continuing feels futile. So I keep showing up. Is that purpose or habit? I honestly can't tell."

"Does it matter which?"

"Probably not."

"Then keep doing it. Purpose or habit—either way, you're showing up. That's what matters."

Elena felt tears forming. Blinked them back. Professional mask. But Marcus saw anyway. He always saw.

"Elena," he said gently, first name instead of Mayor. "You're allowed to not be okay."

"I'm the mayor. I have to be okay."

"Says who?"

"Says the two point two billion people relying on me."

"The two point two billion people relying on you know you're human. They don't need you to be perfect. They need you to be present. There's a difference."

Wei's teaching, filtered through Marcus. Elena heard the echo—presence over perfection, showing up over solving, witness over success. Her deputy mayor had absorbed the philosophy completely.

"When did you become a Buddhist?" she asked.

"I'm not. I'm a pragmatist who learned that pragmatism includes acknowledging what matters. You matter. Your presence matters. The fact that you keep showing up when showing up accomplishes nothing—that matters most of all."

"Why?"

"Because it's honest. Because it says: I see you, I'm here, I can't save you but I won't abandon you. That's governance. That's what you do every morning. That's what I help you do."

They finished lunch in silence. Then Marcus returned to his office and Elena returned to her work—policy reviews, resource allocation, infrastructure planning for systems that would exist for eleven more years then vanish.

---

Afternoon brought the usual chaos. Security incident in District 7—riot over food distribution, twelve injured, no deaths. Elena authorized emergency rations and additional medical support. Knew it wouldn't prevent the next riot. Didn't matter. You handled today's crisis today.

Power outage in Sector 12. Chen reported repair crews responding but undermanned. Elena authorized overtime pay from reserves that wouldn't last but didn't need to last forever. Eleven years of reserves was plenty.

Health services requesting additional mental health staff. Dr. Ade's voice tight with exhaustion: "We're losing people daily to suicide. Not enough therapists. Not enough beds. Not enough anything." Elena approved the hire authorization. Knew they wouldn't find enough people. Approved it anyway.

Prison report. Daniel Okonkwo, Year 2 into a 15-year sentence for manslaughter. Still writing weekly letters to Raj Patel's widow. Still receiving no response. Mental health deteriorating but stable enough for continued imprisonment.

Elena filed this away without comment. Marcus Rivera watched her carefully.

This was governance. Not grand strategy. Not visionary leadership. Just: responding to today's emergencies. Maintaining today's systems. Showing up today. Tomorrow would bring more crises, more failures, more overwhelming need. She'd show up tomorrow too.

At 6 PM, Marcus stopped by her office. "Go home."

"I have more work."

"You always have more work. The work is infinite. Your capacity isn't. Go home."

"In a moment." Elena looked at him. "You read the prison report."

"I did."

"You think I was wrong. To deny the pardon."

Marcus chose his words carefully. "I think you chose justice over mercy. Both have value. But yes—I think Reyes was right. I think Okonkwo should be with his children."

"He killed someone."

"Yes. And he's dying from guilt in that cell. His children are growing up without him. Raj Patel is still dead. What does keeping Daniel imprisoned accomplish except more suffering?"

"It upholds the principle that actions have consequences. Even at the end of the world."

"Does it? Or does it just add cruelty to tragedy?" Marcus stood. "You asked why I stay. Part of it is this: I disagree with you about Daniel Okonkwo. I think you're wrong to keep him imprisoned. But you're still governing honestly, still trying to maintain justice in impossible circumstances. I respect that even when I think you're mistaken. That's why I stay—to witness your witness, to challenge when challenge is needed, to help you carry this burden even when we disagree about how to carry it."

Elena felt the words settle. "You think I should pardon him."

"I think mercy matters more than justice when time is short. But: it's your decision. You're the mayor. You're the one who has to live with either choice."

"I am." Elena turned back to her work. "Thank you for saying it anyway."

"That's my job. Go home when you can."

He left. Elena sat with her decision—Daniel Okonkwo in prison, two years down, thirteen years left until they all died anyway. Justice maintained. Consequence upheld. A man separated from his children forever because he killed his friend over food during a riot caused by systems she governed.

Was Marcus right? Was Reyes right? Should mercy matter more?

She didn't change her mind. But she wondered. And the wondering would stay with her.

At 6 PM, she finally went home.

"I have more work."

"You always have more work. The work is infinite. Your capacity isn't. Go home."

Elena looked at her deputy mayor. Thirty-five years old, carrying weight he didn't have to carry, staying when he could leave. "Why are you doing this, Marcus? Really?"

"I told you. I want to help bear the burden."

"But why? You could be anywhere. Doing anything. Why stand beside a sixty-six-year-old woman governing collapse?"

Marcus sat down across from her. Considered his answer carefully. "Year 2, I ran against you because I thought you were wrong. Thought governance was theater. Thought we should focus on comfort, not dignity. Thought your witness was empty symbolism."

"You said all this in the debates."

"I meant it then. I was wrong. Not about pragmatism—we need that. But about symbolism being empty. I've watched you for two years now. Watched you show up every morning. Watched you hold briefings for five people. Watched you govern when governing accomplishes nothing. And I realized: you're doing the hardest thing. Maintaining presence when presence seems meaningless. That's not empty. That's everything."

"It doesn't save anyone."

"Saving isn't the only form of value. You witness us. You document us. You maintain structure when everything fractures. You say: this matters, you matter, we're doing this together. That's valuable. That's why I stay. Someone should witness you witnessing. Someone should help you carry this. I want that someone to be me."

Elena felt the tears again. Didn't hide them this time. "Thank you."

"Thank you for letting me help. Now go home. That's an order from your deputy."

She went home.

---

Home was an apartment she barely recognized. Kenji's room was empty—had been empty for two years. His possessions remained: books, dissertation notes, clothes. Frozen in time. Waiting for a return that might not come.

Elena made tea. Sat in her living room. The megacity glowed outside her window—two point two billion lights, each one a person, each person facing extinction, all of them somehow continuing.

She pulled up Professor Wei's latest letter. The philosopher was 118 now, dying naturally before the asteroid. Her teaching had spread everywhere—letters, students, conversations. Elena had never met her. Probably never would. But Wei's words had shaped the last four years more than any policy decision.

*Mayor Torres—*

*I understand you question the value of your governance. This is natural. You cannot save anyone. You cannot stop the ending. Your power has revealed itself as impermanent, like all power always was. The asteroid makes visible what was always true: control is illusion.*

*But witness is not illusion. Presence is not illusion. You govern not to control outcomes—you never could. You govern to be present to your people as they face the end. To maintain dignity when nothing else can be maintained. To say: I am here. I see you. This matters.*

*Your work is not measured in lives saved or problems solved. Your work is measured in presence sustained. Four years of showing up. Four years of bearing witness. Four years of maintaining structure when structure seemed meaningless. This is everything.*

*Do not mistake lack of outcome for lack of value. The flower blooms knowing it will fade. Blooming is not futile because fading is certain. Blooming is purpose itself. You bloom. Your governance blooms. The city you tend blooms. All temporary. All beautiful. All necessary.*

*Eleven years remain. Continue blooming. Continue governing. Continue showing up. Not because it changes the ending. Because it honors the middle. Because presence is purpose. Because you are exactly where you should be, doing exactly what should be done.*

*With deep respect,  
Professor Mei-Lin Wei*

Elena read the letter three times. Felt something loosen in her chest—not relief exactly, more like recognition. Wei understood. Saw what she was doing. Saw that it mattered even when it accomplished nothing.

She opened her journal—official record, personal practice, document for archives that wouldn't survive but existed now. Wrote:

*Year 4, Month 7. Day 1,577. Population 2.2 billion. Infrastructure failing. Systems collapsing. Governance continuing.*

*I govern because someone should. I bear witness because witness is purpose. I show up because showing up is everything when showing up is all we have.*

*Marcus stays. Chen stays. Kowalski and Dr. Ade stay. Fifty thousand public servants across Antarctica stay. Not because we can save anyone. Because presence matters. Because witness matters. Because continuing matters even when continuation changes nothing.*

*Kenji writes from Mumbai. Still seeking. Still lost. Still alive. I'm proud of him. Both of us trying to face the end with clarity. Both of us failing mostly. Both of us continuing anyway.*

*Eleven years left. I'll spend them governing. Not because I'm clinging to power. Because this is my practice. Because bearing witness is purpose. Because someone should say: we were here, we mattered, we faced the end together with dignity.*

*That's enough. Has to be. Is.*

She closed the journal. Made more tea. Sat at her window watching the city lights. Thought about Year 6. About the election. About running unopposed, maybe. About legitimate consent versus passionate choice. About democracy in the ending.

Would people vote? Would they care? Would electoral legitimacy matter when everything ended in eleven years?

She didn't know. But she'd hold the election anyway. Because ritual mattered. Because process mattered. Because maintaining the forms—even when the substance seemed gone—was itself a form of witness.

Morning would bring another briefing. Five people. Same reports. Infrastructure failing. Deaths rising. Population declining. She'd document it. They'd respond to crises. They'd maintain what they could. They'd continue.

Because what else? Because this was governance. Because someone should do it. Because Elena was mayor and being mayor meant showing up.

Four years down. Eleven to go. She'd spend them bearing witness. Maintaining dignity. Continuing.

Purpose or habit, it didn't matter. She'd show up.

That was enough.

---

**Year 4, Month 7.** The morning briefing would happen again tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. For eleven more years.

Elena Torres would be there. Marcus Rivera would be there. Chen, Kowalski, Dr. Ade would be there.

Five people governing 2.2 billion. Maintaining order in collapse. Bearing witness to the ending.

Not because it changed anything.

Because someone should.

Because presence was purpose.

Because governance, in the end, was just: showing up.

And Elena kept showing up.

The work continued.
