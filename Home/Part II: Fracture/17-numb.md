# Chapter 17: Numb

**Dr. Amara Okafor | Year 4, Month 1 | Antarctic Monitoring Station**

---

3:47 AM.

Four years. Exactly four years since she'd detected it. Amara sat at the same workstation where she'd first seen the data that ended the world. Different building now—they'd moved the monitoring equipment to a smaller facility after the old station became too expensive to maintain with so few staff. But same shift. Same time. Same asteroid approaching with perfect mathematical precision.

**Countdown: 10 years, 2 months, 14 days remaining.**

She updated the trajectory. Observation 43,829. The asteroid was precisely where physics said it would be—deviation from prediction: 0.00003%. Perfect. Predictable. Inevitable.

The station hummed around her. Empty. Dr. Kim had quit last month—went to Tokyo to spend time with his grandchildren. Dr. Patel transferred to Lagos two weeks ago, citing "personal reasons." Amara was alone now. Completely. The only human in a facility designed for sixty.

She didn't mind. Preferred it, actually. No awkward small talk. No colleagues trying to be supportive. No one asking how she was doing. Just her and the data and the infinite silence of space.

The monitoring systems were fully automated. Had been for three years. The global telescope network fed data directly to the AI processors. Trajectory calculations updated in real-time. Amara's presence was unnecessary. The machines could do everything she did, faster and more accurately.

But she showed up anyway. Graveyard shift. Every night. Checking calculations that didn't need checking. Updating models that didn't need updating. Maintaining a vigil that served no purpose beyond giving her something to do.

The tea beside her had gone cold. When had she made it? An hour ago? Two? Time was becoming elastic at 3:47 AM, stretching and compressing in ways physics couldn't explain. She took a sip anyway. Bitter. Metallic. Familiar.

Her secondary screen displayed the global death statistics. New data set she'd started tracking Year 2. Aggregate mortality across all causes, updated daily from the UN Health Coordination Network. The numbers climbed with their own mathematical precision:

**Total deaths Years 1-4: 1,247,392,847**

1.2 billion people. Dead in four years. Not from the asteroid—that came later. From despair, from violence, from abandonment of will. Suicides still climbing—up 380% from baseline. Homicides up 295%. "Natural causes" down 67%—people weren't living long enough to die of old age.

Amara processed this scientifically. Created graphs showing mortality trends by region, by cause, by demographic. Projected future deaths based on current acceleration. Her model predicted total pre-impact deaths would reach 3.4 billion. Forty-three percent of current population, gone before the asteroid arrived.

She filed the report. Sent it to the UN Mortality Database. No one responded. No one cared. The reports went into the archive, read by no one, useful to no one. But someone should document. Someone should count. Someone should say: these deaths happened, these lives ended. Even if the record itself would end.

The numbers didn't hurt. That was the important thing. Statistics were clean. Data was manageable. She could look at 1.2 billion deaths and feel nothing. The numbness was protective. Necessary. If she let herself feel what the numbers represented, she'd shatter.

Better to calculate.

Her message queue showed 847 unread. She'd stopped checking six months ago. Stopped responding two years ago. The queue was mostly automated alerts now—system updates, data confirmations, trajectory verifications. But buried in there: messages from Zara. From David. From colleagues who'd tried to stay in touch before giving up.

Amara's hand hovered over the delete button. Delete all unread? One click and the messages would vanish. No guilt. No obligation. Clean data streams only.

Her finger didn't press.

Instead, she opened her sister's folder. 287 messages from Zara spanning four years. Amara hadn't read them in months, but she hadn't deleted them either. They existed in quantum superposition—both present and ignored, mattering and not mattering simultaneously.

She scrolled through the timestamps. Year 1: daily messages. Year 2: weekly. Year 3: monthly. Year 4: every few months. The frequency declining as Zara's hope faded.

The most recent was from three weeks ago. Amara opened it.

A video. Zara in her garden in Lagos, sunlight streaming through whatever plants she was growing. Two children visible—Maya (6 years old, serious expression, reading a book) and Kofi (3 years old, laughing at something off-camera, chasing a butterfly).

Zara looked directly into the camera. Tired but present. "Amara. It's been two years since I heard from you. I don't know if you're getting these messages. I don't know if you're okay. I don't even know if you're alive—no one at your station will tell me anything."

She paused. Took a breath. "But in case you are getting them: your niece and nephew exist. Maya reads at second-grade level now. Kofi learned to count to twenty yesterday. They're real. They're here. They won't be here in ten years, but right now they're alive."

Another pause. Longer. "I'm not angry anymore. I understand why you disappeared. I think. You calculated everyone's death and it broke something in you. That makes sense. But Amara—" Her voice cracked slightly. "—you're my sister. I miss you. Maya asks about her aunt. Kofi doesn't remember you at all. That hurts."

Zara wiped her eyes. "I'm not asking you to fix yourself. I'm not asking you to be okay. I know you're not. But please. Just respond. Just tell me you're alive. That's all. Please."

The video ended. Kofi's laughter echoing in the background before cutting to silence.

Amara stared at the frozen final frame. Her sister's face, mid-wipe, tears and sunlight and exhaustion all visible. Behind her: Maya reading, Kofi playing, life continuing despite extinction.

She should respond. She knew this intellectually. Should send message: "I'm alive. I'm sorry. I love you." Simple. Human. Required.

Her fingers hovered over the reply button. Had hovered there for four years. Still hovering. Still unable.

What would she say? *Sorry I calculated your children's deaths and then vanished into data*? *Sorry I can't access emotions anymore*? *Sorry I chose numbness over connection*?

The truth was simpler and worse: she didn't want to respond. Didn't want to see her niece and nephew. Didn't want to watch them grow and laugh and live knowing exactly when they'd die. Maya would be seventeen when the asteroid hit. Kofi would be fourteen. Neither would reach adulthood. Neither would have children. Neither would matter beyond their brief existence.

No. That was wrong thinking. They mattered now. Brief didn't mean meaningless. She'd heard that argument, read it in papers, seen philosophers discuss it. Intellectually, she understood.

But she couldn't feel it. Couldn't access that truth emotionally. In her numbness, everything was equally meaningless—Maya and Kofi, David and Zara, herself and humanity. All temporary. All doomed. All reducible to statistics in the great dying.

Better not to engage. Better to stay in the data.

She closed the message without responding. Returned to her calculations.

The asteroid's albedo had shifted slightly—0.002% change in reflectivity. Probably rotational variation. She updated the model, incorporated the new data. Impact probability remained stable: 99.97%. The asteroid approached with perfect indifference.

Her door chimed. 4:15 AM. Who would visit at 4:15 AM? No one worked here anymore. No one lived nearby. The building should be empty.

She checked the security camera. David. Standing in the hallway outside her office. Looking uncomfortable. Holding two cups of what was probably tea.

Amara's first impulse: don't answer. Pretend she wasn't here. Wait for him to leave.

But he'd seen her car outside. Knew she was here. Would wait.

She opened the door.

"Hi," David said. Fifty-two years old now. Grey in his beard. Tired eyes. Her husband of thirteen years, looking like a stranger.

"Hi."

Silence. The familiar, uncomfortable silence of two people who'd forgotten how to talk to each other. David held out one of the cups.

"Brought tea. Figured you'd be here. You're always here."

Amara took the cup. Still warm. "Thanks."

More silence. David didn't leave. Just stood there, holding his own tea, looking at her with something like concern. When had he last looked at her? Actually looked? She couldn't remember.

"Can I come in?" he finally asked.

Amara wanted to say no. Wanted him to leave so she could return to the comfortable numbness of calculation. But some vestigial part of her—the part that remembered being married, being human—nodded.

David entered. Looked around the office. Single desk. Three monitors. No personal items. No photos. No plants. Nothing human. Just: data and screens and the hum of processors.

"You've been here every night for four years," he said quietly.

"Someone needs to monitor the trajectory."

"The AI monitors it. You know that. This is all automated."

"Manual verification is important."

"For what?" Not aggressive. Just: asking. "What are you verifying? The asteroid is where it should be. Always is. Always will be. You checking it doesn't change anything."

Amara felt defensive. "Documentation matters. Someone should witness. Someone should record."

"Why?"

The question hung in the air. Why? Why document what would be destroyed? Why record what would vanish? Why witness what no one would remember?

"Because," Amara said finally. Not an answer. Just: a placeholder for the truth she couldn't articulate.

David nodded like he understood. Maybe he did. He maintained solar arrays that would vaporize in ten years. Same futility. Same need to do something.

He sat down in the spare chair—unused, dusty, probably hadn't been occupied in months. Sipped his tea. Looked at her monitors. The countdown displayed prominently: **10 years, 2 months, 14 days**.

"I'm worried about you," he said.

"Don't be. I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You haven't been fine since detection. Four years, Amara. Four years of this. You barely eat. You never sleep. You don't talk to anyone. Your sister—"

"Don't." Amara's voice sharper than intended. "Don't bring up Zara."

"She's been trying to reach you for four years. She has a son now. Kofi. Your nephew. You've never even—"

"I know." Amara cut him off. "I get her messages. I know about Kofi. I know about Maya. I know everything. I don't need you to tell me."

"Then why don't you respond?"

Because I can't. Because feeling anything breaks the numbness and the numbness is the only thing keeping me functional. Because seeing my niece and nephew means acknowledging their deaths and I can't do that and still calculate.

"I'm busy," she said instead.

David laughed. Not a happy sound. Bitter. Exhausted. "Busy. Right. Calculating the same trajectory for the ten thousandth time. That's more important than your family."

"It's not about importance. It's about—" She stopped. What was it about? She didn't know anymore.

David set down his tea. Leaned forward. "Amara. Look at me."

She didn't want to. Looking at him meant seeing his concern, his love, his pain. Meant acknowledging she'd hurt him through four years of absence. Easier to look at screens.

"Please," he said quietly.

She looked. His face was open. Vulnerable. Hurt. This man she'd married sixteen years ago. This man who'd loved her through twenty years of work obsession and emotional distance. This man who deserved better than a wife who'd chosen numbness over connection.

"I'm leaving," he said.

The words took a moment to process. Leaving. Leaving what? The station? Antarctica? Her?

"Leaving?"

"You. Us. This." He gestured vaguely. "I can't do this anymore. Can't watch you disappear into data. Can't live with a ghost."

Amara felt something shift. Not quite emotion. More like: the recognition that emotion should be present. This was her husband telling her their marriage was ending. She should feel something. Sadness. Anger. Loss. Relief.

She felt nothing.

"Okay," she heard herself say.

David blinked. "Okay? That's it? Thirteen years and you say 'okay'?"

"What do you want me to say?"

"I want you to say something! Anything! Tell me you're sad. Tell me you're angry. Tell me you care that I'm leaving. Just—feel something."

But she couldn't. The numbness was complete. Total. Protective and destructive in equal measure. David leaving should matter. She knew this intellectually. But knowing and feeling were different things, and she'd lost the connection between them.

"I'm sorry," she said. True but hollow. "You deserve better."

"I don't want better. I want you. The you I married. The brilliant, passionate, impossible woman who cared too much about everything. That Amara. Not this—" He gestured at her, at the office, at the data surrounding them. "—this empty shell calculating the apocalypse."

Amara looked at him. Tried to find words. Failed. What could she say? The woman he'd married was gone. Had died the moment she detected the asteroid. This was what remained: calculations and numbness and hollow witness.

David stood. Left his tea on the desk. Walked to the door. Paused.

"Your sister keeps trying," he said quietly. "Maya asks about you. Kofi doesn't know you exist. They have ten years left and you're wasting them hiding in data. But that's your choice. I can't make you care. No one can."

He left. The door closed with a soft click. Amara alone again.

She sat in the silence. Her husband had just left her. Thirteen years of marriage, ended. She should feel something. Should cry or rage or collapse. Should do something human.

Instead, she turned back to her monitors. Updated the trajectory. The asteroid was exactly where it should be. Observation 43,830. Deviation: 0.00003%. Perfect.

The data was clean. Reliable. Safe.

At 6:30 AM, her shift ended. Amara didn't leave. Stayed at her desk, reviewing calculations that didn't need reviewing. Updating models that didn't need updating. Maintaining vigil that served no purpose.

The morning sun rose over Antarctica's ice, streaming through reinforced windows, illuminating the empty station. Somewhere in Lagos, her sister was waking her children. Somewhere in the maintenance complex, her ex-husband was—what? Packing? Crying? Relieved?

She didn't know. Couldn't let herself wonder. That way lay feeling, and feeling was the enemy.

The countdown continued: **10 years, 2 months, 14 days remaining.**

Amara calculated.

## Later — Year 4, Month 3

The separation paperwork arrived digitally. Automated, clean, impersonal. David wanted dissolution of marriage on grounds of irreparable separation. No dispute of assets. No request for support. Just: end this.

Amara signed without reading the details. Authorized her half of the apartment to transfer to him. Sent the documentation back. The marriage ended with the same mathematical precision as everything else in her life.

She moved into the monitoring station permanently. It had a small dormitory—unused, dusty, designed for overnight shifts. She claimed a room. Brought her clothes. Set up a sleeping mat. The station became her home. Why leave? Work was here. Data was here. Purpose, such as it was, was here.

Her colleague Chen (infrastructure coordinator, no relation to David) sent a report: Antarctica population down to 2.8 billion. Power grid at 68% capacity. Water systems at 73%. Transport network at 45%. The megacity was dying slowly. Services collapsing as staff abandoned posts. Buildings going dark. Districts evacuating.

Amara processed this as data. Created visualizations. Projected full collapse timeline: Year 8 at current rate. The city would be mostly empty before the asteroid arrived. People fleeing to—where? Everywhere. Nowhere. Dying elsewhere instead of here.

She filed the report. Updated her mortality models. Added infrastructure collapse as contributing factor. The mathematics remained clean even describing civilizational death.

At night—or what passed for night in the endless work—she sometimes opened Zara's folder. Didn't watch the videos. Just looked at the thumbnails. Her sister's face. Her niece and nephew. Proof that life continued. Proof that some people chose presence over numbness.

She never replied. Couldn't bridge the gap between knowing she should and being able to. The distance was too great. The numbness too complete.

Better to calculate.

The asteroid approached. Perfect trajectory. Perfect mathematics. Perfect certainty.

**10 years, 15 days remaining.**

Amara updated the model. Observation 47,392. Deviation: 0.00002%.

The data was clean.

That was enough.

That had to be enough.

Alone in the empty station, surrounded by screens full of death, Amara calculated the apocalypse one observation at a time.

The universe didn't care that she'd stopped feeling.

The asteroid approached anyway.

Perfect.

Predictable.

Inevitable.
