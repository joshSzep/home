# Chapter 18: Teaching

**Professor Mei-Lin Wei | Year 5, Month 4 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia had dropped its petals overnight.

Wei noticed this first thing, wheeling herself onto the balcony at dawn. Yesterday the bloom had been perfect—white petals curled tight, fragrance hanging in the air like memory. This morning: browning edges, petals scattered on soil below. Three days of blooming. Now: composting.

That was truth. Beautiful, simple truth.

She maneuvered her wheelchair carefully among the raised beds. Movement required concentration now. Her body was 118 years old and reminded her constantly—hands shaking, vision blurring at the edges, breath shorter than it used to be. The wheelchair had been necessary for six months. Before that, a walker. Before that, a cane. The progression was predictable, mathematical, honest.

Her mind remained sharp. That's what mattered. Let the body dissolve. Let the machine fail. Consciousness persisted until it didn't, and she would use it while she had it.

The lemon tree needed water. Wei filled the can from the rain barrel—a system Zara had helped install two years ago, part of Lagos District's greywater reclamation project. Engineering persisting despite futility. Wei appreciated that. Work continuing because work mattered, not because work would last.

She watered the tree carefully, watching the soil absorb. Fifty years old, this tree. Grown from seed in Beijing. Transported through three moves, four climate zones, one lifetime. In ten years it would burn. But today it needed water. So she watered it.

Voices at her door. Wei turned, saw Zara entering with Maya and Kofi. Maya was seven now—tall for her age, serious-faced, carrying a picture book. Kofi was four—all energy and curiosity, already running toward the garden.

"Professor Wei!" Kofi's voice was pure delight. "Garden! Flowers!"

"Careful," Zara called. "Gentle with the plants."

"Let him run," Wei said. "Gardens are for living in."

Kofi explored with the focus only four-year-olds possessed—touching leaves, examining bugs, talking to butterflies. Maya approached Wei more deliberately, the book clutched carefully.

"I brought the butterfly book," Maya announced. "Can I read to Kofi?"

"Please."

Maya settled on the bench, Kofi climbing up beside her. Wei positioned her wheelchair nearby, listening. The morning was warm and bright. Lagos District waking below. Five years into the apocalypse. Ten years remaining. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful.

Maya opened the book. "The Butterfly Life Cycle," she read carefully. "First, the caterpillar—"

"Not 'becomes butterfly,'" Wei interrupted gently. Maya looked up, used to these corrections. "What does the book say?"

Maya read again: "'The caterpillar becomes a butterfly.' That's what it says."

"Imprecise language. Not becomes. Transforms. Becoming suggests something added. Transformation is change from within. The caterpillar doesn't become a different creature. It transforms into what it always was going to be."

Maya considered this seriously. "So the caterpillar is already the butterfly?"

"The caterpillar contains the potential for butterfly. The transformation reveals what was hidden. Everything changes. Nothing is added."

"Like people?" Maya asked. "Are we transforming?"

Wei felt Zara's attention sharpen. The question was dangerous, profound. Are we transforming? Yes—toward death. Toward ending. Toward revelation.

"Yes," Wei said simply. "Like people. We're all transforming. All the time. Birth to childhood to adulthood to old age to death. Continuous transformation. The asteroid doesn't change this. Just makes the timeline visible."

"Will it hurt?" Maya's voice was small. "The transformation?"

Zara moved instinctively toward her daughter, but Wei caught her eye, shook her head slightly. Let the child ask. Let truth be spoken.

"I don't know," Wei said honestly. "The asteroid impact will be fast. Probably no pain. But Maya—the transformation itself, the dying, that's not the problem. The problem is fearing it so much we forget to live."

Maya absorbed this. "I don't want to be afraid."

"Then practice not being afraid. Practice being here. Right now. Reading to your brother. Sitting in this garden. Watching the butterflies. That's all practice is—being where you are."

Kofi pointed at a butterfly—black and orange, landing on the gardenias. "Pretty!"

"Very pretty," Wei agreed. "It emerged from chrysalis two days ago. In three more days, dead. One week of flying. But right now—beautiful."

Maya returned to reading. Wei watched the children, watched Zara tending to the vegetables, watched the morning light shift through leaves. This was teaching. Not lectures. Not theory. Just: presence. Example. Seeds planted through daily practice.

---

After the family left—promising to return tomorrow, as always—Wei wheeled herself inside. Her apartment was small, carefully organized for wheelchair access. Zara had helped with that too, understanding before Wei asked that mobility was failing.

The desk was covered with letters. Wei had been writing more in the past year, understanding her time was short. Natural death would claim her before the asteroid. Probably within two years, the doctors said. Her body was finishing its transformation.

She picked up the latest letter to Elena Torres. Had never met the mayor in person, but they'd been corresponding for five years now. Knew her through their letters, through the news reports, through the understanding that came from years of honest exchange. Wei understood Elena's work. Understood the burden of showing up when showing up accomplished nothing.

The letter continued:

*Mayor Torres—*

*Five years of letters between us. I understand your work better now than when I first wrote. You maintain order when order is impossible. Show up to briefings when no one shows up. Sign documents that won't matter. Lead when leadership can't save anyone.*

*This is wisdom. This is everything.*

*You think your work is futile. I understand. What is the point of governing when everyone dies? What is the point of maintaining structure when structure will end? These are good questions. The mind seeks purpose in outcomes. The mind wants work to accomplish something.*

*But witness doesn't require outcome. Presence doesn't require permanence. You govern not to save anyone—you can't save anyone. You govern to be present to them. To say: I see you. I'm here. We face this together.*

*That matters. That is meaning itself.*

*Consider the flower. It blooms for three days. Does the brevity make blooming futile? No. The flower blooms because blooming is its nature. You govern because governing is your nature. Outcome is irrelevant. Practice is everything.*

*A young man wrote to me months ago—Elena's son, seeking teacher. He'd mentioned studying in Tokyo, learning about the ox-herding pictures but unable to embody them. I responded: The pictures aren't ladder to climb. They're mirror to see where you are. Being present to Picture One is also practice. He hasn't written back. Sometimes seekers need silence more than words.*

*Your son seeks what you've already found. He wanders the world looking for how to live ten years. You live those ten years by showing up. Every morning. Every briefing. Every decision that won't matter and matters completely.*

*I teach this in my garden. You teach this in your office. We're doing the same work from different positions. Bearing witness to life's impermanence. Staying present despite futility. That's all wisdom is.*

*Continue. Your work matters precisely because it can't save anyone.*

*— Wei*

She sealed the letter, addressed it carefully. Would send it through the postal network—old-fashioned, but reliable. Elena would receive it in a few days. Would read it, perhaps, between briefings. Would continue her practice of governance. The teaching spreading like seeds—wind-carried, finding soil in unexpected places.

Three more letters waited. One to a seeker in Tokyo who'd written asking about meaning. One to a community organizer in Mumbai. One to Father Tomás—Brazilian priest she'd been corresponding with, faith shattered, seeking replacement.

Wei wrote to them all. Same message, different words. Impermanence is truth. Presence is practice. Meaning exists in the moment, not the outcome. Simple philosophy. Ancient philosophy. Philosophy humanity kept forgetting and relearning.

---

Afternoon brought visitors. Three young people—early twenties, seekers from Mumbai. Wei heard them at her door, wheeled herself to answer.

"Professor Wei?" The young woman in front looked nervous. Indian, maybe twenty-three, wearing the simple clothes of ashram life. "We heard about your teaching. Hoped you might speak with us."

"Come in."

They entered hesitantly—the young woman (who introduced herself as Priya), a pale young man (Liam from Australia), and a South African woman (Thandiwe). All seeking. All desperate. All carrying the same question: *How do we live ten years knowing we'll die?*

Wei made tea. The ritual was automatic, despite her shaking hands. Water heated. Leaves steeped. Cups filled. The simplest ceremony. The most necessary.

They sat on her balcony among the plants. The garden had become her classroom. Better than any lecture hall. Life demonstrating impermanence in real time. Better teaching than words could provide.

"We heard you understand," Priya began. "How to live the ending. We're at the ashram trying to learn. Meditating. Studying. But—" Her voice cracked. "Nothing helps. The fear doesn't go away."

"Why should it?" Wei asked.

Priya looked confused. "What?"

"Why should fear go away? You're dying. Fear is appropriate response. The question isn't how to eliminate fear. The question is how to live alongside it."

Liam leaned forward. "But the meditation teachers say—"

"What do they say?"

"That enlightenment dissolves fear. That if we practice enough, death won't matter."

"Ah." Wei sipped her tea. "Yes. This is common confusion. Enlightenment isn't numbness. Isn't obliteration of feeling. Is recognition of impermanence. Fear can coexist with wisdom."

"So we'll always be afraid?" Thandiwe's voice was small.

"Maybe. Or maybe fear transforms. Like caterpillar becoming butterfly—excuse me, caterpillar *transforming* into butterfly." Wei smiled. "We change too. Fear becomes something else. Not disappeared. Just: different."

She set down her cup, gestured to the garden. "Look at these plants. I've tended them for years. Every season, some die. Every season, I grieve a little. After 118 years, does grief disappear? No. Does it become easier? Yes. The practice isn't eliminating grief. Is being present to it. Feeling it. Letting it transform."

"How do you practice that?" Priya asked.

"You're doing it right now. Sitting here. Drinking tea. Being present to your fear instead of running from it. That's practice."

"That's all?" Liam sounded skeptical. "Just... sitting?"

"Just sitting. Just breathing. Just tending gardens. Just drinking tea. Yes. That's all. People want dramatic answers. Want special techniques. Want secret wisdom. But the wisdom is simple: be here now. That's everything."

They sat quietly, drinking tea, watching the garden. Kofi's earlier energy still hung in the air somehow—laughter echoing. Maya's serious questions. Zara's steady presence. The garden held all of it. Brief moments layering over each other, composting into meaning.

"I don't understand," Liam admitted finally. "Intellectually, yes. I understand impermanence. I understand presence. But emotionally—" He touched his chest. "Here. I can't feel it. Can't live it."

"Yes," Wei said. "Intellectual understanding is easy. Emotional integration is practice of lifetime. You're twenty-two?"

"Twenty-three."

"I'm 118. I've practiced this 
for forty years. Still practicing. The gap between knowing and living is what we work with. Don't expect to close it quickly. Just: practice. Every day. Sitting. Breathing. Being present to what is."

"Do you fear death?" Thandiwe asked softly.

Wei considered. "Sometimes. My body is failing. That's uncomfortable. I don't fear the dying—that's just transformation. But I grieve this life ending. Grieve the garden. Grieve the students. Grieve the sunrise. Not because I want permanence. Because beauty is beautiful. Letting go is hard even when you've practiced your whole life."

"But you're okay with it?" Priya pressed.

"I accept it. Acceptance and okay are different. I accept that I'll die probably within two years. Natural death, before the asteroid. I accept that my body is failing. That my time teaching is limited. That this garden will continue briefly without me, then burn with everything else. I accept all this. Do I feel okay? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Feeling changes. Acceptance remains."

She looked at the three young seekers. "You want wisdom that will make this easy. There is no such wisdom. This is hard. Dying is hard. Living knowing you'll die is hard. The practice doesn't make it easy. Makes it bearable. Makes it meaningful. Makes it rich. Ten years of presence is worth more than eighty years of distraction."

"How do we start?" Liam asked.

"You've already started. You're here. Asking questions. Sitting in this garden. Drinking tea. This is practice. Tomorrow, do it again. Next day, again. Every day until you die. That's all. Simple and impossibly difficult."

---

They stayed for two hours. Asked more questions. Received more non-answers. Finally left, bowing respectfully, promising to practice. Wei watched them go, knowing: maybe one would integrate the teaching. Maybe none. Seeds scattered. Some take root. Most don't. That was okay.

Evening brought Zara back alone. Children with Kwame. Zara helped Wei prepare dinner—simple meal, companionable silence. They'd developed rhythm over five years. Zara anticipating what Wei needed before she asked. Wei teaching without words.

"Maya asked about death today," Zara said while chopping vegetables. "Really asked. Not abstract. Direct."

"I heard."

"Did I handle it wrong? Should I have—"

"You handled it perfectly. You let her ask. Let me answer. Didn't shield her. That's right parenting for this time."

Zara was quiet, cutting precisely. Then: "Professor Wei, do you fear death?"

Wei smiled. "Second time today. Same answer: sometimes. I grieve this life ending. But I've practiced letting go for 118 years. This is final practice."

"I can't imagine that peace."

"It's not peace. It's acceptance. Peace sounds gentle. Acceptance is work. Daily work of releasing attachment while still loving completely. Loving the impermanent without trying to make it permanent. That's the practice."

"How do you love something you know you'll lose?"

"How do you not? Everything is temporary. You know Maya will die. Does that stop you loving her?"

"No. Makes me love her more. Desperately. Fiercely."

"Yes. That's right. Impermanence intensifies love. Makes it real. Permanent love would be abstract. Temporary love is everything."

They cooked together. Simple meal. Rice, vegetables, tea. The apartment filled with domestic warmth. Wei felt: grateful. For this meal. For Zara's companionship. For five years of teaching through gardens and tea and honest conversation.

After dinner, Zara helped Wei to bed. The evening routine. Wei's body needed help now with basic tasks. Humbling. Necessary. Zara was gentle, efficient, not pitying. Perfect balance.

"Thank you," Wei said when settled.

"For what?"

"For letting me teach your children. For tending my garden. For being present. You're a good student."

"I'm a terrible student. I panic regularly. I grieve constantly. I can't accept—"

"That's why you're good student. You're honest about the difficulty. Students who claim enlightenment worry me. Students who admit they're struggling—those are real practitioners."

Zara smiled. "See you tomorrow, Professor."

"Tomorrow. Bring the children."

"Always."

---

Alone in darkness, Wei lay in bed not sleeping. Her body was tired. Her mind was active. Ten years until the asteroid. Two years, maybe less, until her natural death. The math was simple.

She thought about the teaching spreading. Letters finding readers. Word passing between seekers. Elena governing with dignity in Antarctica. Zara raising children with defiance here in Lagos. People she'd never meet maintaining purpose—builders, teachers, parents, workers. All connected through simple philosophy, though most didn't know the source.

Seeds scattered. Some taking root. The gardenia that had bloomed and died—its seeds would sprout next season. Briefly. Before everything ended. But the blooming mattered. Not because it lasted. Because it happened.

Her teaching was the same. Brief blooming. It would end with the asteroid. No permanent impact. No lasting legacy. Just: ten years of letters and conversations and garden lessons. Ten years of saying the same simple truth: *be here now, be present to impermanence, love what you'll lose.*

That was enough.

Wei felt her body settling toward sleep. 118 years old. Consciousness flickering. Tomorrow she would wake (probably). Tend the garden (if her hands permitted). Write more letters (if her eyes focused). Teach Maya and Kofi (who would arrive like clockwork). Continue the practice until practice ended.

Simple. Perfect. Complete.

The gardenia had dropped its petals, but the plant was already forming new buds. Bloom, die, bloom again. That was the cycle. Brief and endless. Temporary and eternal. Nothing lasted. Everything mattered.

She slept.

---

Morning came. Wei woke (she had woken, consciousness persisting one more day). Wheeled herself to the balcony. The garden waited. New gardenia buds, just as she'd seen last night. The lemon tree standing patient. Everything continuing despite her, because of her, independent of her.

She watered the plants. The morning ritual. Same as 118 years of mornings. Same as every morning would be until mornings ended.

Voices at the door. Zara arriving with Maya and Kofi. Punctual. Present. Practicing.

"Garden!" Kofi announced, running to the flowers.

"Professor Wei," Maya said seriously, "I have questions about the butterflies."

"Good. Questions are practice too."

They settled into the garden. The teaching continued. Simple lessons about blooming and dying. About caterpillars transforming. About being present to what is. The same teaching Wei had offered for forty years, now compressed into final years, final months, final lessons.

She was 118 years old. Her body was failing. Her death approached naturally. And she was teaching children who would die at seventeen and fourteen, teaching a mother who would die at forty-seven, teaching seekers who would die young, teaching a mayor who would die governing.

All of them temporary. All of them practicing. All of them perfect exactly as they were.

The gardenia bud would bloom tomorrow. In three days it would fall. That was truth. That was beauty. That was everything.

Wei taught until the children needed lunch. Then she wrote letters until her hands shook too much. Then she rested until Zara returned. Then she ate dinner. Then she slept.

Tomorrow, the same. Day after, the same. Until different. Until transformation. Until natural death or collective ending or some other change she couldn't predict.

That was fine. That was the practice. That was the teaching.

*Be here now. Love what you'll lose. Bloom and die. Transform.*

Simple wisdom. Ancient wisdom. The only wisdom there was.

Wei taught it until she couldn't. That was enough. That was everything. That was all anyone could ever do.

The garden bloomed around her. Temporary. Beautiful. Real.

Perfect.
