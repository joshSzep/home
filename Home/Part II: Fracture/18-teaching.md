# Chapter 18: Teaching

**Professor Mei-Lin Wei | Year 5, Month 4 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia had dropped its petals overnight.

Wei noticed this first thing, wheeling herself onto the balcony at dawn. Yesterday the bloom had been perfect—white petals curled tight, fragrance hanging in the air like memory. This morning: browning edges, petals scattered on soil below. Three days of blooming. Now: composting.

That was truth. Beautiful, simple truth.

She maneuvered her wheelchair carefully among the raised beds. Movement required concentration now. Her hands shook enough that steering demanded attention. Her vision blurred at the edges—the glaucoma had worsened despite treatment. The wheelchair had become necessary six months ago, when her right hip finally refused weight-bearing. Before that, a walker. Before that, a cane. The progression was predictable.

"My body is negotiating its terms of surrender," she'd told Zara last week. "Each month it demands new concessions."

Her mind remained sharp. That was the compensation. Let the machine fail. She would use consciousness while she had it.

The lemon tree needed water. Wei filled the can from the rain barrel—Zara's greywater system, installed two years ago. Li Chen's tree, fifty years old, still bearing fruit. In ten years it would burn. But today it needed water.

Voices at her door. Wei turned, saw Zara entering with Maya and Kofi. Maya was seven now—tall for her age, serious-faced, carrying a picture book. Kofi was four—all energy and curiosity, already running toward the garden.

"Professor Wei!" Kofi's voice was pure delight. "Garden! Flowers!"

"Careful," Zara called. "Gentle with the plants."

"Let him run," Wei said. "Gardens are for living in."

Kofi explored with the focus only four-year-olds possessed—touching every leaf, interrogating every beetle, narrating his discoveries to the sky. Four was a good age for practice, Wei thought. They were already masters of presence. Adults spent years trying to recapture what children did naturally.

"I brought the butterfly book," Maya announced. "Can I read to Kofi?"

"Please."

Maya settled on the bench, Kofi climbing up beside her. Wei positioned her wheelchair nearby. The morning was warm. Lagos District waking below.

Maya opened the book. "The Butterfly Life Cycle," she read carefully. "First, the caterpillar—"

"Not 'becomes butterfly,'" Wei interrupted gently. Maya looked up, used to these corrections. "What does the book say?"

Maya read again: "'The caterpillar becomes a butterfly.' That's what it says."

"Imprecise language. Not becomes. Transforms. 'Becoming' suggests something added from outside." Wei tapped her temple. "The butterfly is already in there, waiting. Transformation reveals what was hidden."

"So the caterpillar is already the butterfly?"

"In potential, yes. Like a seed is already the tree. Just requires the right conditions and a lot of patience." Wei smiled. "Though I suppose patience is easier for seeds than for seven-year-olds."

"Like people?" Maya asked. "Are we transforming?"

Zara's attention sharpened. Wei felt it.

"Yes. Birth to childhood to old age to death. The asteroid just lets us see the deadline clearly."

"Will it hurt?" Maya's voice was small. "The transformation?"

Zara moved instinctively toward her daughter, but Wei caught her eye, shook her head slightly. Let the child ask. Let truth be spoken.

"I don't know," Wei said honestly. "The asteroid impact will be fast. Probably no pain. But Maya—the transformation itself, the dying, that's not the problem. The problem is fearing it so much we forget to live."

Maya absorbed this. "I don't want to be afraid."

"Then practice not being afraid. Practice being here. Right now. Reading to your brother. Sitting in this garden. Watching the butterflies. That's all practice is—being where you are."

Kofi pointed at a butterfly—a swallowtail, black and orange, landing on the gardenias. "Pretty!"

"Very pretty," Wei agreed. "That one emerged from chrysalis two days ago. Dead in three more. One week of flying."

"That's sad," Maya said.

"Is it? One week of doing exactly what you were meant to do." Wei watched the butterfly probe a bloom. "I've been doing what I was meant to do for forty years. The butterfly is more efficient."

Maya returned to reading. Wei watched the children, watched Zara tending vegetables. This was teaching. Not lectures. Just presence.

Later, while Kofi napped on a blanket in the shade and Zara pruned the mint, Maya came back to the bench. She'd finished the butterfly book. Her face was thoughtful—that particular expression Wei had learned to recognize as meaning she was working something out.

"Professor Wei?" Maya's voice was careful. "Can I ask you something?"

"Always."

"Why do you teach us about dying? Mama says most children don't learn this."

Wei considered the question. Seven years old and already asking the real questions. This one had depth. "Do you want me to stop?"

"No." Maya shook her head firmly. "I want to understand. But I want to know why you think it matters."

Wei smiled. Children were honest. Adults wrapped their questions in politeness. Maya just asked.

"Let me tell you a story," Wei said. "About a prince named Siddhartha, a very long time ago. His father kept him in a beautiful palace, protected from everything difficult. Beautiful gardens. Perfect life. Never saw sickness, or old age, or death. Completely sheltered."

"Why?" Maya's eyes were intent.

"His father wanted him happy. Thought if Siddhartha never saw suffering, he'd never suffer." Wei shook her head. "But you can't be awake while sheltered from truth."

"What happened?"

"He left the palace. Saw four sights. First: a sick person. Second: an old person. Third: a dead body. Fourth: a wandering seeker—someone who'd given up everything to find truth." Wei paused. "Those four sights changed everything."

"Why?" Maya repeated.

"Because he saw what his father had been hiding. Everyone gets sick. Everyone gets old. Everyone dies. The truth everyone pretends isn't real." Wei touched Maya's shoulder lightly. "Seeing it—really seeing it, not just knowing about it—that awakened him. He couldn't go back to pretending once he'd seen."

Maya was quiet for a long moment. Processing. Wei waited.

"But I already know everyone dies," Maya said finally. "The asteroid. Mama told me."

"Yes. You know it." Wei nodded. "But knowing and seeing aren't the same. Knowing is here." She tapped her head. "Seeing is here." She touched her heart. "Someday, you'll understand the difference. When you see something that makes the knowing become real. That's when practice starts mattering."

Maya's face was serious. "When will that happen?"

"I don't know. Different for everyone. Maybe not until you're much older." Wei smiled. "But when it happens, remember this story. Remember that the prince became the Buddha because he saw truth and didn't look away."

Maya nodded slowly. Filed it away. Wei could see her storing it—the way children stored important things, not always understanding but keeping them safe for later.

"Can I water the lemon tree?" Maya asked.

"Please."

Maya took the watering can—too heavy, but she managed—and carefully watered the tree. Complete focus. Present to the task. Wei watched her and thought: this one will remember. When the time comes, she'll remember.

---

After the family left—promising to return tomorrow, as always—Wei wheeled herself inside. Her apartment was small, carefully organized for wheelchair access. Zara had helped with that too, understanding before Wei asked that mobility was failing.

The desk was covered with letters. Wei had been writing more in the past year, understanding her time was short. Natural death would claim her before the asteroid. Probably within two years, the doctors said. Her body was finishing its transformation.

She picked up the latest letter to Elena Torres. Had never met the mayor in person, but they'd been corresponding for five years now. Knew her through their letters, through the news reports, through the understanding that came from years of honest exchange. Wei understood Elena's work. Understood the burden of showing up when showing up accomplished nothing.

The letter continued:

*Mayor Torres—*

*Five years of letters. I understand your work now. You maintain order when order is impossible. Show up to briefings when no one comes. Sign documents that won't matter. Lead when leadership can't save anyone.*

*You think your work is futile. I understand. But witness doesn't require outcome. Presence doesn't require permanence.*

*Consider the flower. It blooms for three days. Does brevity make blooming futile? No. The flower blooms because blooming is its nature. You govern because governing is yours. (I write letters because writing is mine. Academics never change.)*

*Your son wrote to me months ago—mentioned studying the ox-herding pictures in Tokyo but unable to embody them. I responded: The pictures aren't a ladder. They're a mirror. He hasn't written back. Sometimes seekers need silence more than words. He'll find his way, or he won't. Either way, he's seeking. That's practice.*

*You've already found what he's seeking. You just don't recognize it. Every morning you show up. That's the ox. You're already riding it.*

*Continue.*

*— Wei*

She sealed the letter, addressed it carefully. Would send it through the postal network—old-fashioned, but reliable.

Three more letters waited. A seeker in Tokyo asking about meaning. A community organizer in Mumbai. Father Tomás—Brazilian priest, faith shattered, seeking something to replace it. Priests in crisis were becoming regular correspondents. Apparently when professional believers stopped believing, they wrote to Buddhist teachers. Wei found this both flattering and slightly unfair—she had eighty years of practice to develop her acceptance. They wanted it delivered by post.

---

Afternoon brought visitors. Three young people—early twenties, seekers from Mumbai. Wei heard them at her door, wheeled herself to answer.

"Professor Wei?" The young woman in front looked nervous. Indian, maybe twenty-three, wearing the simple clothes of ashram life. "We heard about your teaching. Hoped you might speak with us."

"Come in."

They entered hesitantly—the young woman (who introduced herself as Priya), a pale young man (Liam from Australia), and a South African woman (Thandiwe). All seeking. All desperate. All carrying the same question: *How do we live ten years knowing we'll die?*

Wei made tea. Her hands shook enough that she spilled water on the counter—twice—but the ritual was automatic. She'd performed it ten thousand times. Her body knew what to do even when it couldn't do it precisely.

"The water goes in the kettle," she said aloud as she wiped up the second spill, "not on the counter. This is advanced technique."

The seekers watched uncertainly. Liam almost offered to help, then stopped himself. Good instinct. She didn't want help. She wanted to make the tea.

They sat on her balcony among the plants. The garden had become her classroom. Better than any lecture hall. Life demonstrating impermanence in real time. Better teaching than words could provide.

"We heard you understand," Priya began. "How to live the ending. We're at the ashram trying to learn. Meditating. Studying. But—" Her voice cracked. "Nothing helps. The fear doesn't go away."

"Why should it?" Wei poured tea, the cups filling unevenly because her hands wouldn't stay still. "You're dying. Fear is reasonable."

Priya looked confused. "But—"

"The question isn't how to eliminate fear. The question is how to live with it sitting beside you." Wei handed Priya a cup. "Like an annoying relative at dinner. Can't make them leave. Can learn not to let them ruin the meal."

Liam leaned forward. "But the meditation teachers say—"

"What do they say?"

"That enlightenment dissolves fear. That if we practice enough, death won't matter."

"Ah." Wei sipped her tea. "Yes. This is common confusion. Enlightenment isn't numbness. Isn't obliteration of feeling. Is recognition of impermanence. Fear can coexist with wisdom."

"So we'll always be afraid?" Thandiwe's voice was small.

"Maybe. Or maybe fear transforms. We change too. I was terrified of my mother dying when I was twenty. She died when I was thirty-two. Still hurt. Hurt differently than I'd feared. Fear doesn't disappear. It ripens into something else."

She set down her cup, gestured to the garden. "I've tended these plants for years. Every season, some die. Do I stop grieving? No. Does it become easier? Some days. The practice isn't eliminating grief. It's being present to it instead of running."

"How do you practice that?" Priya asked.

"You're doing it right now. Sitting here. Drinking tea. Being present to your fear instead of running from it. That's practice."

"That's all?" Liam sounded skeptical. "Just... sitting?"

"Just sitting. Breathing. Tending gardens. Drinking tea without spilling it—which I'm no longer capable of, as you've noticed." Wei smiled. "People want dramatic answers. Secret techniques. Mystical revelations. Disappointing, isn't it? Be here now. That's it. Ancient teaching. No copyright."

They sat quietly, drinking tea, watching the garden. A second butterfly joined the first on the gardenias.

"I don't understand," Liam admitted finally. "Intellectually, yes. But emotionally—" He touched his chest. "Here. I can't feel it."

"Yes. Intellectual understanding is Tuesday. Emotional integration is the rest of your life." Wei looked at him. "You're twenty-three?"

"Twenty-three."

"I'm 119. I've practiced for forty years. Still practicing. The gap between knowing and living is what we work with. You want to close it in one conversation?"

"Do you fear death?" Thandiwe asked softly.

Wei considered. "My body is failing. That's uncomfortable. Painful sometimes. My hip hurts most mornings. My eyes are going." She paused. "I don't fear the dying—that's just transformation. But I grieve this life ending. Grieve the garden. Grieve the students. Grieve the sunrise. This particular light through these particular leaves." She touched a gardenia bloom. "I've practiced letting go my whole life. Still hurts."

"But you're okay with it?" Priya pressed.

"I accept it. Different thing. I accept that I'll die within two years, before the asteroid. I accept that my body is failing. That this garden will continue briefly without me, then burn with everything else." She spread her shaking hands. "Acceptance. Do I feel *okay*? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Feelings change. Acceptance just means I've stopped arguing with reality."

She looked at the three young seekers. "You want wisdom that will make this easy. There is no such wisdom. Dying is hard. The practice doesn't make it easy. Makes it bearable. Sometimes even meaningful." She smiled. "Ten years of presence is worth more than eighty years of distraction. But you don't get to skip the difficult parts."

"How do we start?" Liam asked.

"You've already started. You came here. Asked questions. Sat in this garden. Drank tea." She gestured at the empty cups. "Tomorrow, do it again. Every day until you die. Simple and impossibly difficult. Teachers have been saying this for three thousand years. Humans keep needing to hear it."

---

They stayed for two hours. Asked more questions. Received more non-answers. Finally left, bowing respectfully, promising to practice. Wei watched them go.

Three seekers. Maybe one would integrate the teaching. Maybe none. That wasn't her concern. Her job was to teach clearly. Their job was to practice or not. Ninety years of teaching had cured her of the delusion that she controlled outcomes.

Evening brought Zara back alone. Children with Kwame. Zara helped Wei prepare dinner—simple meal, companionable silence. They'd developed rhythm over five years. Zara anticipating what Wei needed before she asked. Wei teaching without words.

"Maya asked about death today," Zara said while chopping vegetables. "Really asked. Not abstract. Direct."

"I heard."

"Did I handle it wrong? Should I have—"

"You handled it perfectly. You let her ask. Let me answer. Didn't shield her. That's right parenting for this time."

Zara was quiet, cutting precisely. Then: "Professor Wei, do you fear death?"

Wei smiled. "Second time today. Same answer: sometimes. I grieve this life ending. But I've practiced letting go for 118 years. This is final practice."

"I can't imagine that peace."

"It's not peace. It's acceptance. Peace sounds gentle. Acceptance is work. Daily work of releasing attachment while still loving. You practice for sixty years, you get better at it. You never master it."

"How do you love something you know you'll lose?"

"How do you not? You know Maya will die. Does that stop you loving her?"

"No. Makes me love her more. Desperately."

"There you go. Impermanence intensifies love. Makes it real. Permanent love would be abstract—like loving a statue."

They cooked together. Simple meal. Rice, vegetables, tea. The apartment filled with domestic warmth. Wei felt: grateful. For this meal. For Zara's companionship. For five years of teaching through gardens and tea and honest conversation.

After dinner, Zara helped Wei to bed. The evening routine—transferring from wheelchair, changing clothes, the small indignities of a failing body tended by younger hands. Zara was efficient, not pitying. Wei appreciated that.

"Thank you," Wei said when settled.

"For what?"

"For letting me teach your children. For tending my garden when I can't. For this." She gestured at herself, at the bed, at the help she needed now for basic tasks.

"I'm a terrible student. I panic regularly."

"That's why you're a good student. You're honest about the difficulty. Students who claim enlightenment worry me."

Zara smiled. "See you tomorrow, Professor."

"Tomorrow. Bring the children."

"Always."

---

Alone in darkness, Wei lay in bed. Her body was tired. Her mind was active—a familiar imbalance.

Ten years until the asteroid. Two years until her natural death. Simple math. She'd thought about death so long it had become almost boring. Just another fact to incorporate.

Elena in Antarctica, governing. Zara here, raising children. Kenji somewhere, wandering. The Mumbai seekers, practicing or not. All connected through simple philosophy—though most didn't know the source, and the source didn't matter.

The gardenia had bloomed and died. Its seeds would sprout next season. Briefly, before everything ended. But the blooming mattered. Not because it lasted.

Because it happened.

Wei felt her body settling toward sleep. 119 years old. Consciousness flickering. Tomorrow she would wake (probably). Tend the garden (if her hands permitted). Write more letters (if her eyes focused). Teach Maya and Kofi (who would arrive like clockwork). Continue the practice until practice ended.

Simple. Perfect. Complete.

The gardenia had dropped its petals, but the plant was already forming new buds. Bloom, die, bloom again. That was the cycle. Brief and endless. Temporary and eternal. Nothing lasted. Everything mattered.

She slept.

---

Morning came. Wei woke (she had woken, consciousness persisting one more day). Wheeled herself to the balcony. The garden waited. New gardenia buds, just as she'd seen last night. The lemon tree standing patient. Everything continuing despite her, because of her, independent of her.

She watered the plants. The morning ritual. Same as 118 years of mornings. Same as every morning would be until mornings ended.

Voices at the door. Zara arriving with Maya and Kofi. Punctual. Present. Practicing.

"Garden!" Kofi announced, running to the flowers.

"Professor Wei," Maya said seriously, "I have questions about the butterflies."

"Good. Questions are practice too."

They settled into the garden. The teaching continued. Butterflies and blooming. Caterpillars and transformation. Being present.

119 years old. Body failing. Teaching children who would die at seventeen and fourteen, teaching a mother who would die at forty-seven.

All of them temporary. All of them practicing. All of them here.

The gardenia bud would bloom tomorrow. In three days it would fall.

Wei taught until lunch, wrote letters until her hands shook too much, rested until dinner, slept.

Tomorrow, the same.

That was the practice.

The garden bloomed around her. Temporary. Beautiful.

Enough.
