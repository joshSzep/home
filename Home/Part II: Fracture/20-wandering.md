# Chapter 20: Wandering

**Kenji Torres | Year 5, Month 9 | Mumbai**

---

The meditation hall smelled of incense and sweat.

Forty people sitting zazen. Dawn light filtering through latticed windows. Silence broken only by breathing. Kenji sat in the third row, legs crossed, back straight, mind anywhere but present.

Fifth month at the ashram. Fifth month seeking. Still seeking.

His mind wandered—always wandered. Supposed to focus on breath. In, out. Simple. Impossible. Instead: thinking about the technique of focusing. Analyzing the practice. Evaluating whether it was working. Meta-awareness that prevented actual awareness. Gap between intellectual understanding and embodied experience. He knew the gap existed. Couldn't cross it.

The bell rang. Meditation ended. Forty people stood, bowed, dispersed. Kenji unfolded his legs—they'd gone numb again. Poor circulation from sitting incorrectly. Poor form from thinking too much about form. Everything in his practice was like this: understanding the mechanics, missing the essence.

Yoga came next. Morning asana practice in the courtyard. Kenji had started attending three months ago—Year 5, Month 6—thinking maybe the problem was too much stillness. Maybe he needed movement. Physical practice to anchor awareness in body instead of head.

Didn't work.

He moved through sun salutations analyzing each pose. *Downward dog: are my heels down? That woman's form is better. I should engage my shoulders more. The teacher said root through hands. Am I rooting? What does rooting feel like? This is thinking again. Just feel the pose. But how do I feel without thinking about feeling?*

Warrior Two. His legs burned—good burn, effort made visible. But instead of being present to the burn, he analyzed it: *This is physical sensation. Muscle fatigue. The Buddha taught that sensation arises and passes. I'm experiencing arising. Soon it will pass. I should be present to the arising. But analyzing arising isn't being present to it. I need to just feel. Not think about feeling. Just feel.*

The recursive trap consumed him even in physical practice. Especially in physical practice. His body was doing yoga. His mind was doing philosophy about yoga. The gap between them absolute.

The session ended. Forty people bowed to the teacher—elderly Indian woman who moved with grace Kenji couldn't imagine achieving. She caught his eye as people dispersed: "You're thinking too much."

"I know."

"Then stop."

"I don't know how."

She smiled sadly. "Neither do I. But keep practicing anyway. Maybe one day the body teaches the mind what the mind can't teach itself."

Kenji bowed and left. The same advice in different words. Tokyo: just sit. Cairo: just think clearly. Mumbai: just move with awareness. All saying the same thing. All equally inaccessible. His body had sat, thought, and moved for nearly four years across three continents. His mind remained locked in analysis. Physical practice hadn't helped any more than stillness. The problem wasn't the practice. It was him.

Outside, Mumbai morning was beginning. Year 5 of the apocalypse. The city looked normal—or as normal as anywhere looked now. People walked to work. Vendors set up stalls. Traffic moved through reconfigured streets. The mundane persistence of life in the face of guaranteed death. Kenji watched it every morning, still unable to integrate the contradiction.

"You're thinking again."

Yuki sat beside him on the ashram steps. Twenty-nine years old, Japanese, intensely committed to enlightenment before the end. She'd arrived at the ashram Year 4, dedicated herself completely. Meditated six hours daily. Studied sutras. Practiced with single-minded focus.

"I'm always thinking," Kenji admitted.

"That's your problem."

"I know. Knowing is also my problem."

Yuki smiled—rare expression for her. "Meta-cognition as obstacle. Classic."

They sat watching the city wake. The ashram was Hindu-Buddhist hybrid, accommodating both traditions and neither fully. Mix of monastics and temporary seekers. Some like Yuki—pursuing enlightenment desperately. Others like Kenji—pursuing understanding without knowing what understanding meant.

"Do you think you'll get there?" Kenji asked. "Enlightenment before the end?"

"I have to believe I will. Otherwise why practice?"

"To practice. To have something to do. To fill time meaningfully."

"That's not enough for me." Yuki's voice was quiet but fierce. "I want liberation. Real freedom from suffering. If I die without achieving that, everything was wasted."

Kenji heard the desperation. Understood it. Felt it differently. Yuki sought enlightenment as escape. Kenji sought understanding as purpose. Different goals, same futility. Probably.

"How long will you stay?" she asked.

"Don't know. Until I'm ready to leave. Or until leaving finds me."

"That's very Zen."

"That's very indecisive."

Yuki laughed. "Same thing, sometimes."

---

Breakfast was communal. Sixty people in dining hall. Vegetarian food prepared by rotating crews. Kenji ate mechanically—tasted nothing, appreciated nothing, just: fueled the body. Another item on his list of failures: couldn't be present even with eating.

Father Tomás sat across from him. Fifty-five years old, Brazilian, former Catholic priest. His faith had shattered Year 1—"How can I worship a God who lets everyone die?"—and he'd spent four years searching for replacement belief. Tried Buddhism, Stoicism, Taoism, secular philosophy. Found pieces in each, whole in none.

"Sleep well?" Tomás asked. His English carried Portuguese rhythm.

"Same as always. You?"

"Dreamed about my old church. The congregation. I told them mass was cancelled permanently due to apocalypse." He smiled sadly. "Even in dreams, the comedy persists."

Kenji liked Tomás—gentle, confused, honest about confusion. No pretense of having answers. No performance of wisdom. Just: searching with full awareness that searching might be futile.

"Have you heard from home?" Tomás asked.

"Letter from my mother yesterday. Things in Antarctica are stable. Population declining but systems holding. She's still governing."

"And that helps you? Knowing she's doing her work while you do yours?"

"I don't know if I'm doing work. I'm traveling. Looking. Not finding."

"Looking is work. Being willing to not-find takes courage."

Kenji considered this. Nearly four years ago—Year 1, Month 6—he'd left Antarctica thinking: I'll find answers out here. Truth about how to live the ending. Some wisdom tradition that handles mortality perfectly. Five months in Mumbai had taught him: no perfect answers exist. Or they exist but remain inaccessible. Or they're accessible but not helpful. Or they're helpful but he's broken in ways that prevent help from landing.

"I'm going to Lagos," he said suddenly. Hadn't known he'd decided until words emerged.

He remembered the ox-herding pictures from Tokyo—three years ago now, Year 2, Month 11. Roshi had taught them. Ten stages from lost to enlightened. Kenji had understood them perfectly, explained them to his mother in careful detail, studied the scroll until he could recite each image. Roshi had said: "You're still on Picture One. Still seeking." Three years later, Kenji could see he'd progressed—maybe Picture Three now. Glimpsing the ox. Seeing it briefly through intellectual understanding. But Picture Three was still fundamentally lost. The ox glimpsed wasn't the ox caught. Understanding wasn't realization. He could see the teaching clearly across Tokyo, Cairo, Mumbai. But seeing wasn't being.

Tomás looked surprised. "When?"

"Soon. Maybe next month."

"Why Lagos?"

"My cousin's there. Zara. She has two kids—Maya and Kofi. And there's this philosopher. Professor Wei. Very old. My mother writes about her sometimes. Correspondence they share. Wei teaches presence, impermanence, acceptance. I want to meet her."

"You could learn that here."

"I've been here five months. Haven't learned it yet."

Tomás nodded slowly. "So: more seeking. Different location."

"Maybe the seeking itself is the point."

"Or maybe the seeking is avoidance."

The words landed hard. Kenji stared at his breakfast. Tomás continued gently: "I do the same thing. Travel, study, practice. Always moving. If I stopped moving, I'd have to feel everything I'm avoiding. So: seeking as defense mechanism."

"Is that wrong?"

"I don't know. Wrong implies moral judgment. This just: is. We're doing what we can. Maybe that's enough."

Maybe. Kenji finished eating. Tomás left for morning sutras. Kenji stayed, staring at empty plate, thinking about avoidance versus seeking versus both being true simultaneously.

---

This was how it felt in Tokyo. In Cairo. Always the same pattern.

Nearly four years of wandering now. Year 1, Month 6 to Year 5, Month 9. Four cities if you counted Antarctica. Three continents. The ox-herding pictures called it "seeking the ox"—Picture One. But Kenji had learned them in Tokyo, Year 2, Month 11. Roshi explaining the ten stages while snow fell outside. Picture One: seeking. Picture Two: finding traces. Picture Three: glimpsing but not holding.

Kenji was on Picture Three. Had been for years. Every city offered glimpses—Tokyo's zazen, Cairo's philosophy, Mumbai's meditation. Moments where he saw clearly, touched something real. Then it vanished. The ox seen but not caught. Picture Four required catching and holding. The gap between glimpsing and catching felt infinite.

Seventeen months in Tokyo—Buddhist monasteries on the city outskirts, zazen practice six hours daily, studying koans with teachers who spoke through translators. He'd understood everything intellectually. The ox-herding pictures. The nature of mind. The practice of just sitting. But understanding remained locked in his head, never dropping into his body. After seventeen months of bowing and breathing and analyzing his inability to stop analyzing, he'd left.

Year 3, Month 2: Cairo. Different approach. Western philosophy this time. If Eastern traditions couldn't help him embody acceptance, maybe Stoicism could teach him through reason. He'd found a community in the desert—secular philosophers living in a half-abandoned research station, practicing memento mori, studying Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus, holding daily sessions on mortality and meaning. More his speed, he'd thought. More aligned with his academic training.

It wasn't.

They'd sit in the desert heat discussing death abstractly while the asteroid approached concretely. "Death is nothing to us," they'd recite, "since when we exist, death is not yet present, and when death is present, then we do not exist." Beautiful logic. Perfect rationalization. Completely useless for actually facing the end.

He'd met other seekers there—ex-academics mostly, people who thought mortality could be solved through right thinking. A German mathematician who'd created elaborate philosophical systems proving death was ontologically neutral. A French existentialist who'd written a six-hundred-page treatise on authentic being-toward-death. An Egyptian woman—Amina, he'd just remembered—who'd analyzed Stoic texts with the same desperate precision he'd analyzed Buddhist sutras.

All of them brilliant. All of them frozen. Philosophy as avoidance dressed up as inquiry.

He'd stayed fourteen months in Cairo. Longer than he should have. The desert silence was seductive—easier to think about mortality in abstract than to feel it in particular. But by Year 4, Month 4, he'd admitted defeat. The Stoics had no special answer. Just different vocabulary for the same unbridgeable gap between knowing about acceptance and actually accepting.

So: Mumbai. Year 5, Month 4. Back to embodied practice. The ashram's Hindu-Buddhist hybrid approach—maybe mixing traditions would help where each alone had failed. Five months now of meditation and manual labor and watching himself fail at presence. Same pattern. Different location.

And now: Lagos. One more city. One more teacher. Professor Wei—118 years old, correspondent with his mother, teaching presence and impermanence to anyone who asked. Maybe she'd be different. Maybe age brought wisdom that younger teachers lacked. Maybe meeting someone who'd actually lived with death for over a century would teach him something the books and practices couldn't.

Or maybe he'd arrive, learn nothing new, leave again. Another stop on the wandering that defined him. Tokyo, Cairo, Mumbai, Lagos. Always moving. Never arriving. Seeking as identity. Avoidance as practice.

Tomás was right. He was running.

But running toward or running away? Both. Neither. The question itself was analytical trap—another way of thinking about seeking instead of actually being present with it.

Kenji stood. The breakfast hall was mostly empty now. Morning work period starting soon. He should go to the garden. Should water vegetables he'd never eat. Should perform purpose whether or not purpose was real.

But first: this decision. Lagos. Professor Wei. One more attempt to learn what he couldn't seem to learn. One more city in the wandering. Maybe the last city. Maybe the place where seeking finally exhausted itself into something else.

Or maybe just: another destination in the long drift toward the end.

---

Afternoons were work period. Ashram required four hours daily labor—cooking, cleaning, gardening, maintenance. Kenji usually chose garden. Something about being outside, hands in soil, growing things that wouldn't outlast the asteroid. Futile cultivation. Perfect metaphor.

Today he worked beside Amina. Twenty-four years old, Egyptian, philosopher studying Stoicism with academic rigor. She'd arrived at the ashram two weeks ago, approaching Eastern practice like dissertation research. Took notes during meditation. Analyzed sutras structurally. Understood everything intellectually, felt nothing emotionally.

Kenji recognized himself in her immediately. Recognized her especially—he'd met someone with her exact name and approach in Cairo. Maybe the same person? He almost asked, then didn't. If she didn't remember him, that said everything about how forgettable his seeking was. If she did remember and hadn't mentioned it, she had her reasons.

They weeded in silence. Eventually Amina said: "This is absurd."

"Gardening?"

"Growing vegetables for people who'll die before these plants reach maturity. The tomatoes will outlive us."

"So?"

"So it's objectively meaningless. We're performing purpose."

Kenji pulled another weed. "Is performed purpose less real than authentic purpose?"

"Yes. Obviously."

"I'm not sure. If the performance helps us survive—psychologically, I mean—then it's functional. Function is meaning."

"That's pragmatism, not truth."

"Maybe they're the same thing."

Amina stopped weeding. Looked at him. "You don't believe that."

She was right. He didn't. But he wanted to. Wanted to believe that seeking was meaningful even when finding was impossible. That traveling taught something even when destination proved illusory. That performing purpose created real purpose through the act of performance.

"I'm leaving next month," he said.

"Where?"

"Lagos."

"Why?"

"There's a philosopher there. Very old. Teaches presence and impermanence. I want to meet her before she dies."

"So: more seeking."

"Yes."

"You know she won't have answers either."

"Probably not. But maybe she's different. The Cairo philosophers were brilliant—we probably crossed paths there Year 3 or 4—but they were all thinking about death, not living with it. Maybe someone who's 118 years old knows something we don't."

"Or maybe you just need to keep moving."

"But you're going anyway."

"Yes."

Amina returned to weeding. "I understand that. I'm doing the same thing. Came here thinking: ashram will have wisdom. Two weeks in: nothing I didn't already know intellectually. But I'll stay another month. Then somewhere else. Always seeking. Never finding. It's exhausting."

"What's the alternative?"

"Stopping. Accepting. Being present with not-knowing."

"Can you do that?"

"No. Can you?"

"No."

They worked in silence. Two seekers, intellectually brilliant, emotionally frozen, gardening vegetables they'd never eat. The absurdity was complete. The absurdity was everything.

---

Evening study was optional. Kenji attended anyway—structure helped. Tonight: discussion on the Dhammapada, led by the ashram's senior teacher. Forty people in meditation hall, now configured with cushions in circle.

The teacher was seventy years old, Indian, with teaching manner that oscillated between profound and inscrutable. He read verse 277: "All conditioned things are impermanent. When one sees this with wisdom, one turns away from suffering."

Discussion opened. Yuki spoke first: "How do we develop that wisdom? How do we really see impermanence, not just understand it intellectually?"

The teacher smiled. "You practice. Every day. Every moment. Eventually understanding deepens into embodiment."

"How long does that take?"

"As long as it takes. There is no schedule."

"But we have ten years!" Yuki's frustration broke through. "Ten years until everyone dies. That's not enough time for gradual enlightenment."

"Then perhaps gradual enlightenment is not the path. Perhaps sudden realization. Perhaps no realization at all. Perhaps accepting non-attainment is the attainment."

The words were classic non-dual teaching. Kenji had heard variations a hundred times across five months. They never helped. Just: confused him more. Either truth existed and could be accessed, or it didn't exist and seeking was futile, or truth was paradox and human cognition couldn't grasp it. All three options felt true and impossible simultaneously.

Father Tomás raised his hand. "Teacher, what if we can't accept impermanence? What if we rage against it? Is that wrong?"

"Nothing is wrong. Rage is also practice. Grief is practice. Confusion is practice. You feel what you feel. Don't add second arrow of judgment."

"But I want peace. I want to stop suffering. That's why I'm here."

"Peace is not absence of suffering. Peace is acceptance of suffering. Different thing entirely."

Kenji listened to the exchange. Tomás seeking peace. Teacher offering acceptance. The gap between them unbridgeable. Like all gaps here. Between intellectual understanding and emotional integration. Between knowing about presence and being present. Between studying Buddhism and becoming Buddhist.

After class, walking back to dormitories, Tomás caught up with him. "Does any of this help you?"

"The teaching?"

"Any of it. The ashram. The practice. The seeking."

Kenji considered honestly. "It gives me structure. Something to do. People to be around who are asking same questions. That helps. But actual answers? Actual transformation? No. Not yet."

"Maybe that comes later."

"Maybe. Or maybe I'm constitutionally unable to access it. Maybe my brain is too analytical. Too Western. Too damaged by academic training."

"Or maybe you're exactly where you need to be."

"That's Buddhist optimism."

"No, that's just: true. You're here. Now. This is exactly where you are. That's definitional."

Kenji laughed. "Tautology as wisdom."

"Sometimes wisdom is tautological."

They reached the dormitories. Separated to respective rooms. Kenji lay on his mat—simple bedding, shared room with five others. Listened to night sounds. Mumbai traffic distant. Other seekers breathing. His own thoughts spiraling.

He pulled up his wrist display. Message from Elena, sent yesterday:

*Mijo—*

*Year 5, Month 8 from Antarctica. Population at 1.9 billion now. Down from 4.2 billion at detection. Infrastructure holding at minimal levels. I govern meetings attended by five people in rooms designed for thirty. Democratic legitimacy becomes question mark—Year 6 election approaching, unclear if anyone will oppose me. Marcus Rivera says people trust my witness more than my power. Strange shift: authority through presence rather than votes.*

*Professor Wei writes to me regularly now. Her letters are brief, clear, profound. She says governance without outcomes is still governance. That showing up when powerless is the whole work. I'm beginning to understand that. Not accept—understanding and acceptance are different. But: understand.*

*Zara sent photos of Maya and Kofi. Your cousin's children are beautiful. Maya is nearly eight now—serious, brilliant. Kofi is almost five—joyful, innocent. Zara is defiant mother, raising children she knows will die young. That defiance is everything. That choice to love what will end—maybe that's the teaching.*

*Come home when you're ready. Or stay abroad. Or keep wandering. Whatever you need. Ten years left—spend them searching if searching helps. Just: stay alive. Stay connected. Let me know you're okay sometimes.*

*I love you. I'm proud of you. Even when you feel lost, you're finding something. I don't know what yet. But something.*

*— Mom*

Kenji read it twice. His mother, most powerful human on Earth, learning philosophy from letters. Governing with presence instead of power. Bearing witness to civilization's collapse. While he wandered ashrams, unable to meditate properly, seeking answers he couldn't define.

Were they doing the same work? Elena staying, Kenji traveling. Both trying to find meaning in the ending. Both failing and continuing. Both present with their respective practices even when those practices felt futile.

He started a reply:

*Mom—*

*Year 5, Month 9 from Mumbai. I'm at an ashram. Hindu-Buddhist hybrid. Lot of seekers here, all trying to figure out how to live the ending. We meditate. Study. Talk in circles mostly.*

*Remember the ox-herding pictures from Tokyo? Year 2, Month 11? I've been thinking about them. I'm on Picture Three—glimpsing the ox. I can see the teaching clearly. Understand impermanence, acceptance, presence intellectually. But I can't stay there. Can't embody it. Picture Four is catching—holding onto understanding through struggle and practice. I don't know how to get there.*

*Met some interesting people. Yuki—Japanese woman desperately seeking enlightenment. Father Tomás—Brazilian priest whose faith shattered. Amina—Egyptian philosopher as emotionally frozen as me. We're all performing seeking. Don't know if it's authentic or avoidance. Maybe both.*

*Nearly four years wandering now. Tokyo taught me I can't stop thinking long enough to meditate properly. Cairo taught me Western philosophy handles death no better than Eastern practice—just different vocabulary for the same failure. Mumbai teaching me the same lessons again. The pattern is exhausting.*

*But Professor Wei writes to you? I'd like to meet her. Zara mentions her sometimes—neighbor, teacher, 118 years old. Maybe she can teach me how to move from glimpsing to catching. How to hold onto the ox when it struggles. Planning to go to Lagos soon. Want to learn from her directly before she dies. Or before I'm too closed off to learn. Whichever comes first.*

*Maybe Lagos will be different. Maybe I'll just keep glimpsing until I die. Both seem possible. Picture Three continuing—seeing but not holding, understanding but not embodying. Four years of wandering. Four years of glimpses. Maybe that's all I'll ever get.*

*I think about you a lot. You governing a dying city. Me wandering dying cities. Both of us trying to find meaning in collapse. Maybe we're doing the same work from different angles. Or maybe I'm just procrastinating while you're actually helping people. Hard to tell.*

*Love you. Miss you. Will come home eventually. Just: not ready yet. Need to exhaust the seeking before I can stop seeking. Does that make sense?*

*— Kenji*

He sent it. Immediately felt the familiar inadequacy—words never captured what he meant. Never bridged the distance. But they were something. Connection attempt. That mattered, probably.

---

Week three of Month 9. Kenji sat with Yuki after morning meditation. She'd been crying—rare for her. Allowed herself emotional expression even more rarely than Kenji.

"What happened?" he asked.

"I've been here eighteen months. Practicing intensely. Six hours of meditation daily. Sutras memorized. Teachers consulted. And I'm exactly where I started. No enlightenment. No liberation. No breakthrough."

"Maybe breakthrough isn't goal."

"It has to be! Otherwise what am I doing? Ten years until everyone dies. If I don't achieve liberation before then, I've wasted everything."

"Or you've practiced something valuable even without achieving end goal."

"That's consolation prize. That's participation trophy. I want real attainment."

Kenji understood. He wanted that too—real transformation, not just: understanding that transformation would be nice. Wanted to be present, not just know about presence. Wanted to accept impermanence, not just study acceptance.

"What if attainment is impossible?" he asked gently.

"Then seeking is futile."

"Does futile seeking have value?"

Yuki looked at him. Eyes red. Face exhausted. "I don't know. You tell me. You've been seeking nearly four years. Tokyo, Cairo, here, wherever you go next. Has it helped?"

Kenji sat with the question. Had it helped? He'd learned things—practices, philosophies, perspectives. Met people. Gained intellectual framework for the ending. But: transformation? Actual change? Peace?

"It's given me something to do," he said finally. "Structure. Purpose. Company with others asking same questions. That's not nothing."

"But it's not enlightenment."

"No. It's not enlightenment."

They sat in silence. Two seekers, practicing futility, continuing anyway. Maybe that was the teaching. Maybe the seeking itself was the practice, regardless of attainment. Maybe showing up to meditation even when meditation didn't work was the whole point.

Or maybe that was just: rationalization for failure.

---

Year 5, Month 10 arrived. Kenji decided: time to leave. Five months was long enough. He'd learned what the ashram could teach him—which was mostly: he couldn't learn what the ashram was teaching. Gap too wide. Mind too analytical. Something broken in him that prevented embodiment.

He told the senior teacher his plans.

"Where will you go?" the teacher asked.

"Lagos. There's a philosopher there. Very old. I want to meet her."

"And you think she will have answers we don't?"

"No. But maybe different questions."

The teacher smiled. "That's wise. Different questions often more valuable than different answers."

"Or maybe I'm just running."

"Running toward and running away can be same movement. Direction matters less than quality of presence during the running."

Kenji bowed. Thanked the teacher. Packed his few belongings—clothing, tablet, journal. Nothing else. He'd learned to travel light. Material simplicity even when mental complexity remained overwhelming.

Goodbyes were brief. Yuki: "Find what you're looking for." Tomás: "Or don't find it. Either is okay." Amina: "Let me know if Lagos helps. I might go there after here."

Before leaving Mumbai entirely, Kenji had one errand—medical supplies for the ashram from the district clinic. The walk took him through the refugee quarter, a place he usually avoided. Too many desperate faces. Too much suffering he couldn't help.

He almost didn't recognize her.

Blonde hair matted, unwashed. Face hollow, cheekbones sharp under stretched skin. Sitting against a wall with three others, all in various states of consciousness. The needle marks on her arms were visible even from distance.

Linnea. From the Lagos party. Year 0, Day 72. Five years ago.

Kenji stopped. Stared. She looked up—pupils pinpoint, eyes unfocused. No recognition. She was too far gone to remember anything beyond the next dose.

"You have anything?" she asked. Swedish accent thicker now, words slurred. "Anything at all?"

He should keep walking. Should let her be someone else's tragedy. Should maintain the detachment he'd cultivated through four years of seeing suffering everywhere.

But he couldn't move.

"Linnea?"

Slight pause. Some flicker behind the eyes. "Do I... know you?"

"Lagos. Year 0. We—" He stopped. What were they? Two lost people who'd spent one drugged night together? "We met at a party."

"Lagos." She laughed—bitter, hollow sound nothing like her loud laugh from five years ago. "Lagos. Yeah. That was... before." She gestured vaguely at herself. "This is after."

"Are you..." He didn't know how to finish the question. Okay? Clearly not. Getting help? Obviously not. Surviving? Barely.

"Am I what? Dying?" Another laugh. "We're all dying, remember? Asteroid. End of everything. So why not this way? At least I won't feel it when it comes."

One of the other people—man, maybe forty, equally wasted—stirred. "She's no good for hours. Already used everything. Come back tomorrow if you want her."

Kenji felt sick. "I don't—I'm not here for—"

"Then why are you here?" Linnea's voice carried unexpected sharpness. "You wanna save me? Tell me to stop? Offer me your ashram wisdom?" She gestured at the building behind them—small temple, meditation center, free clinic. "They try every day. The helpers. The fixers. The enlightened ones. Telling me there's better way. But this?" She held up her scarred arms. "This is the only better way I've found."

"There are programs. Treatment centers—"

"For what? Fifteen more years of sobriety before we all burn? No thanks." She closed her eyes, leaning back against the wall. "I studied trees, you know. Did I tell you that? Year 0? Biologist. Trees. The big ones, centuries old. Sequoias. Bristlecone pines. Three thousand years old, some of them. And the asteroid kills them too. All that time, all that life. Gone." 

She opened her eyes, looked at him with sudden terrible clarity. "You were the deflection guy. The PhD. Could've stopped it but couldn't. We're the same, you and me. Both failed at our work. Just chose different ways to cope. You travel. Seek. Meditate. I do this. Neither works. Neither matters. At least mine doesn't pretend."

The words landed like physical blows. She was right. They'd both been at that party Year 0, both seeking oblivion, both running. He'd gotten out. She hadn't. Luck? Choice? Something else?

"I got clean," he said quietly. "After that night. Went home. Stopped."

"Good for you." No sarcasm. Just: tired statement. "I tried. Year 1. Rehab in Stockholm. Made it four months. Then I thought: why? What am I staying sober for? To watch everything end clearheaded? Fuck that."

Kenji crouched down, eye level with her. Saw the person underneath the addiction—biologist who'd studied ancient trees, Swedish girl who'd come to Lagos seeking something, twenty-two-year-old who'd offered him pills with glassy-eyed generosity.

"Where do you stay?" he asked.

"Anywhere. Here. There. Does it matter?"

"Do you eat?"

"When someone brings food. The clinic people. They're persistent." She smiled slightly. "Don't worry about me, deflection boy. I'm fine. I'm exactly where I chose to be."

"I don't think—"

"Don't think. That's your problem. Too much thinking. I stopped thinking Year 1. Much better."

One of her companions groaned, stirring from stupor. Linnea's attention shifted immediately—checking if he had anything, needed anything, wanted something. The network of addiction. The constant focus on the next dose, the next escape, the next forgetting.

Kenji stood. Felt helpless. Felt guilty. Felt the enormous weight of their different paths—both started at the same party, both took the same pills, both fell apart. But he'd had his mother. Had resources. Had the privilege to seek instead of sink.

Linnea hadn't.

"I'm leaving Mumbai," he said. "Going to Lagos. To—" Why was he telling her this? "To learn from a teacher there."

"Lagos." Linnea's voice was distant now. "Tell Lagos I said hi. Tell the parties and the music and the lights. Tell them Linnea's still dancing. Just differently now."

He left her there. Walked away through the refugee quarter with medical supplies he'd forgotten to pick up and guilt he couldn't metabolize. The walk back to the ashram took forty minutes. Every step carrying Linnea's hollowed face. Her sharp clarity. Her choice to die this way instead of that way.

Both of us running, she'd said. Just different directions.

That night, before sleeping, he added a postscript to his letter to Elena:

*P.S. — Saw someone today from Year 0. The parties. She's deep in addiction now. Barely alive. Said we're the same—both running, just different methods. She might be right. I got out. She didn't. Don't know why. Luck. Privilege. Timing. But I can't help her. Can't save her. Can only witness and move on. Is that enough? Is witnessing without helping just voyeurism? Don't know. But it haunts me. Will keep haunting me.*

The next morning, one last encounter before his transport. Kenji found Marcus Reyes at the children's center—small building on ashram grounds where refugees taught local kids. Reyes had been there three years, teaching English and basic science.

They'd met twice before in Antarctica—brief conversations, mutual recognition. Kenji respected Reyes' choice to leave power for presence. Wanted to hear his perspective on seeking.

"Did you find it?" Kenji asked. "What you came here for?"

Reyes looked up from helping a seven-year-old with spelling. "Define 'it.'"

"Purpose. Peace. Whatever you were looking for when you left Antarctica."

Reyes considered. Forty years old now, calm in ways Kenji envied. "I found something. Not what I expected. I came to escape responsibility, to stop being defined by eight years of service. Found I couldn't escape. Service is part of me. So I teach children instead of governing mayors. Different service. Same nature."

"Does that feel like finding or failing?"

"Both. Neither." Reyes smiled slightly. "Your mother asks me the same questions in her letters. 'Are you happy? Did leaving work? Was it worth it?' I tell her: I'm present. That's different from happy but better than numb. Leaving was right. Being here is right. Eventually leaving here will be right too. Everything in its time."

"She writes to you?"

"Quarterly. I write back. We maintain connection without proximity. That's enough." Reyes studied Kenji. "You're leaving too. Going to Lagos?"

"To meet a Professor. Philosopher. Wei. Before she dies."

"Good. Wei's teaching might land better than ashram philosophy."

It seemed Reyes knew everyone. Kenji didn't ask how. Just accepted it.

Reyes continued. "Wei is more grounded. More practical. Less about achieving states, more about accepting what is." Reyes touched the boy's shoulder gently. "Spelling is good, Arjun. Keep going."

He turned back to Kenji. "Your mother loves you deeply. Worries about you constantly. When you're ready, go home. Not for her—for you. The seeking is valuable. But so is returning. I left Antarctica three years ago. Haven't gone back. Maybe won't. But I think about it. Think about showing up one last time before the end. Being there with people I served. Maybe you'll feel the same. Maybe not. Just: don't let pride keep you away if returning is what you need."

Kenji felt unexpected emotion. "Thank you."

"Travel well. Learn what you can. Send regards to Wei from me—I've read her letters to your mother. She's remarkable."

On his last evening, Kenji sat in the meditation hall alone. Forty cushions empty. Incense burned down to ash. Mumbai sounds filtering through latticed windows—traffic, voices, life continuing despite the countdown.

He closed his eyes. Tried to meditate. Tried to be present. Mind wandered immediately—thinking about Lagos, about Wei, about his mother, about the ten years remaining, about whether seeking was meaningful or just: addiction to motion.

After twenty minutes he opened his eyes. Still not present. Still analytical. Still broken in familiar ways.

But: he'd shown up. He'd tried. He'd spent five months practicing something he couldn't do well. That was worth something. Maybe not enlightenment. Maybe just: effort. Honest effort in the face of inadequacy.

Maybe that was enough.

The transport to Lagos departed early morning. Kenji watched Mumbai recede—sprawling city, climate-adapted, thriving despite apocalypse. Year 5 of the ending. People still lived. Still worked. Still sought meaning.

He was part of that seeking. One seeker among millions. Nothing special. Nothing profound. Just: another human trying to figure out how to live ten years.

The transport climbed. Sky opened. Earth curved below—beautiful, doomed, indifferent.

Kenji thought about Professor Wei. 118 years old. Spent lifetime practicing impermanence. Teaching presence. Offering wisdom to anyone who sought it. She was dying naturally—body failing while mind remained clear. Lucky death. Old death. The kind most humans wouldn't get.

What would she teach him? Same things the ashram taught, probably. Presence. Acceptance. Letting go. The gap between intellectual understanding and embodied experience. But: maybe hearing it from someone who'd actually embodied it would help.

Or maybe not. Maybe he'd arrive in Lagos, meet Wei, learn nothing new, move on to the next place. Another destination in endless seeking. Another stop on the wandering that defined his twenties.

Running toward or running away?

Both. Neither. The question itself was analytical trap. He was moving. That was the fact. Judging the movement as progress or avoidance—that was secondary interpretation. Maybe unnecessary interpretation.

He pulled up his tablet. Started another letter to Elena:

*Mom—*

*Leaving Mumbai. Going to Lagos. Want to meet Professor Wei before she dies. Before I'm too lost to learn. Before the seeking becomes pure avoidance.*

*Five months at ashram taught me: I understand impermanence intellectually but can't embody it. I know about presence but can't be present. I study acceptance but can't accept. Gap between knowing and being remains unbridgeable.*

*Is seeking futile? Probably. Am I continuing anyway? Yes. Because what else would I do? Seeking gives structure. Purpose. Something better than parties, better than destruction, better than nothing.*

*You wrote about governing with presence instead of power. I think I'm seeking with motion instead of arrival. Maybe parallel practices. You staying, me traveling. Both trying to make meaning in collapse.*

*Ten years left. I'll probably spend them wandering. Different cities. Different teachings. Same questions. Same failure to answer them. But: maybe the wandering is the point. Maybe seeking without finding is the practice. Maybe I'm exactly where I need to be, which is: lost.*

*Love you. See you eventually. Still alive. Still trying.*

*— Kenji*

He sent it. The transport continued west. Mumbai disappeared behind clouds. Ahead: Lagos. Professor Wei. His cousin Zara. Her children. Another destination. Another seeking.

Always seeking. Never arriving.

Maybe that was the teaching.

Kenji closed his eyes. Let the transport carry him. Felt the movement—artificial, mechanical, directional. Not meditation. Not presence. Just: motion through space. Body traveling while mind analyzed the traveling.

Ten years left. How many more cities? How many more teachers? How many more conversations about impermanence with people equally unable to accept it?

He didn't know. Couldn't know. The future was foreclosed—asteroid guaranteed. But the present remained open. Mysterious. Unknowable despite all his analysis.

Lagos next. Then: whatever came after Lagos. Then: whatever came after that.

Wandering until wandering exhausted itself. Seeking until seeking revealed its own futility. Running until running transformed into something else—arrival, acceptance, presence. Whatever those words meant.

The transport hummed. Kenji breathed. Year 5 continued. The seeking continued.

Picture Three continuing. Glimpsing continuing. Four years of seeing the ox without catching it. Maybe Lagos would teach him how to finally hold on. Or maybe—and this felt more honest—maybe Lagos would teach him that glimpsing was enough. That being present to Picture Three was also valid practice. That he didn't need to reach Picture Ten before the asteroid arrived.

The ox had been glimpsed. That was something. Three years ago in Tokyo, Roshi said he was still on Picture One. Now: Picture Three. Progress, even if it felt like failure. Two pictures in three years. Maybe that was the actual pace of transformation—glacial, invisible, real.

Everything continued because what else would it do?
