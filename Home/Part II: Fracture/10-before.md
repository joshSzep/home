# Chapter 10: Before

**David Chen | Year -1, Month 6 | Antarctica, Residential District 7**

---

The morning Amara first told him about the anomaly, David was making eggs.

Not synthetic eggs. Real eggs—a splurge from the premium market in District 3, where you could still find animal products if you didn't mind paying three days' wages for a carton of twelve. Amara had a conference presentation that afternoon, something about orbital mechanics, and David wanted to celebrate.

"The albedo measurements don't match the spectral analysis." Amara's voice drifted from the bedroom, distracted, half-awake. She always thought out loud in the mornings—processing overnight data before her brain fully engaged.

"Mmm." David cracked an egg. Perfect yellow yolk, sliding into the heated pan.

"It's probably instrumentation drift. Malek's team recalibrated last month but the secondary array always runs hot."

"You want cheese?"

"What?" She appeared in the doorway, still wearing her sleep shirt, hair wrapped in the silk scarf she used to protect her curls. Beautiful even half-conscious. Beautiful always. "Did you say cheese?"

"Real cheese. The goat kind from that place near the port."

Her face softened from distracted scientist to present wife. "David. That costs—"

"I know what it costs." He smiled at her. "Your presentation's a big deal. The orbital perturbation thing. I wanted to celebrate."

She crossed the kitchen—twelve steps in their small apartment—and wrapped her arms around him from behind. He felt her cheek against his shoulder blade, warm through his thin shirt. Presence. This was what mornings were supposed to be.

"It's not even a real discovery," she said. "Just methodology. A better way to track objects in the outer system. Nobody cares about methodology."

"You care about methodology."

"Because I'm obsessive."

"You're thorough." He flipped the egg, maintaining the yolk intact. "And brilliant. And about to revolutionize outer system observation. And my wife. In that order."

She laughed. The sound of her laughing—he catalogued it without thinking. Lower register, slightly surprised, genuine. The sound she made when he caught her off guard with affection. He loved catching her off guard.

"Your wife should be higher on that list."

"Okay. Wife, brilliant, thorough, revolutionary. Better?"

"Much."

She released him and reached for the coffee maker—her ancient French press, the one piece of equipment she'd brought from her mother's Lagos kitchen. David had learned to love that press. Learned to love watching her make coffee with the same precision she applied to calculations. Three scoops. Water at exactly ninety-six degrees. Four minutes steep time.

Methodology. She applied it to everything.

They ate together at the small table by the window. District 7 spread below—residential blocks stepping down toward the port, the morning crowd of commuters visible as moving specks. Antarctica's permanent daylight poured through the glass. Six months into summer, no night for weeks.

"What's your day?" Amara asked, scraping up the last of her eggs. She'd devoured them—always ate fast, brain already racing ahead to the next thing.

"Platform inspections. Sector 4 solar coverage. 47B and I are running efficiency audits."

"You and your robot." Affectionate, not dismissive.

"My very capable colleague."

"Does 47B know it's your colleague?"

"47B knows many things." David sipped his tea—green, properly steeped, because he had methodology too. "It's learning my patterns. Anticipating what I'll need before I know I need it."

"Sounds like a good marriage."

"Jealous?"

She considered. That was Amara—she considered jokes as seriously as she considered data. "Maybe. Sometimes I wish I could anticipate what you need."

"You anticipate plenty."

"I anticipate the wrong things. I anticipate that you need space when you actually need company. I anticipate you need solutions when you need listening."

David set down his tea. This was new territory—the vulnerable morning Amara who sometimes appeared when the data wasn't distracting her. He'd learned to move carefully in these moments.

"You're getting better at it."

"Am I?"

"You're here. Eating eggs. Having coffee. That's what I need most mornings."

"That's nothing."

"It's everything." He reached across the small table, touched her hand. Her fingers were cooler than his—always were. "The showing up. The being present. That's the whole thing."

She looked at him. Something shifted in her expression—the scientist receding, the wife arriving. "I love you. You know that, right? Even when I'm distracted. Even when I'm in my head. I love you."

"I know."

"Good." She squeezed his hand, then released it. "Because I'm going to be very distracted for the next few months. This new methodology—if it works, if the calibration holds, we could detect objects we've never seen before. The outer system is full of things we've missed."

"Things?"

"Comets. Asteroids. Bodies we've never tracked because we didn't have the resolution." Her eyes were shining now—science-Amara fully awake, passionate and brilliant. "Imagine knowing everything that's out there. Every object on every trajectory. Complete situational awareness of our solar neighborhood."

David smiled. He loved this version of her—the one who got excited about invisible rocks in distant space. The one whose passion made mundane astronomy feel like adventure.

"Sounds important."

"It could be. If the methodology proves out. If—" She stopped. Checked the time. "I need to shower. The presentation's at two and I want to run the simulations one more time."

"Go. I'll clean up."

She stood, paused, came around the table to kiss him. Brief but present. Her lips tasted like coffee and the eggs he'd made her. Home.

"Thank you for breakfast."

"Anytime."

She disappeared toward the bathroom. David heard water running, her voice humming something—she always hummed in the shower, something her mother taught her.

He cleaned the dishes. Washed the pan, dried the plates, wiped down the counter. Domestic rituals that structured his mornings. Amara had her methodology. David had his maintenance.

---

That evening, she came home late. Ten PM, apologetic, carrying data tablets and the distracted expression that meant she was still processing.

"The presentation went well?"

"Better than well. Dr. Vasquez wants to expand the methodology. Apply it systematically. Do a full survey of known objects, then look for anomalies." She set down her tablets, but didn't sit. Pacing. She paced when excited. "If we can identify everything that's out there—every asteroid, every comet, every body on every trajectory—we'll know exactly what's coming. No surprises. Complete awareness."

"Sounds like a lot of work."

"Years of work. Maybe decades." She finally sat, but on the edge of the chair, energy still humming. "But important work. Work that matters."

"All work matters."

"You don't believe that."

He considered. "I believe all work done well matters. Whether it's mapping asteroids or maintaining solar arrays. The doing well part is what counts."

Amara studied him. That look she got sometimes—seeing him as data, analyzing patterns. "You really believe that."

"I really do."

"Even though my work might discover something that changes everything? And your work just keeps the lights on?"

"Especially because of that." David rose, went to the kitchen, started making her tea—chamomile, for evening. "Someone has to keep the lights on. Someone has to show up every day and do the small work that holds everything together. That's not less important than discovery. It's just different."

"What if I discover something terrible?"

He paused, kettle in hand. "What do you mean?"

"What if my methodology finds something we don't want to know? An object on a collision course. A comet aimed at Earth. Something that changes everything."

David poured water over the tea. Let it steep. Brought it to her.

"Then we'll know. And knowing is better than not knowing. And you'll be the one who gave us the warning. That's a gift, even if the knowledge is hard."

She took the tea. Held it without drinking. Her eyes were distant—calculating probabilities, maybe. The odds of finding something terrible. The weight of being the one who looked.

"I hope I don't find anything," she said quietly.

"I know."

"But I have to look."

"I know that too."

She sipped her tea. He sat beside her. Outside, the Antarctic summer stretched toward midnight without darkness—just the long, pale twilight of a world that never fully slept.

---

They went to bed together. Made love slowly, present to each other in a way that didn't always happen. Afterward, she curled against him, her cold feet seeking his warmth.

"David?"

"Mm."

"If I find something. Something bad. Will you still be here?"

"I'll always be here."

"Even if the world changes?"

He kissed her forehead. Pulled her closer. "Especially then. The maintaining never stops. The showing up never ends. Whatever comes, I'll still be making eggs and fixing arrays and loving you."

She relaxed against him. Sleep coming, finally. Her brilliant mind quieting for a few hours.

"I love you," she murmured.

"I love you too."

---

Eight months later, she found the asteroid.

And nothing David had promised held true.

He didn't stay. She didn't stay. The world changed and they changed with it—apart instead of together, isolated instead of connected. The maintaining failed. The showing up ended. They divorced four years after detection, two people who'd promised to hold each other through anything, broken by the weight of knowing what was coming.

But that morning—the eggs, the coffee, her hand in his—that morning was real. Before the asteroid. Before the knowing. Before everything fell apart.

They were happy once.

David carries that knowledge like a tool in his belt: not heavy, but always present. Proof that connection was possible. Proof that they'd managed it, briefly. Proof that what broke could, maybe, be rebuilt.

Eight years after the divorce, he knocked on her door with breakfast and hope. Started again. Learned to stay, learned to show up, learned that the maintaining never really ends.

But some mornings, still, he makes eggs. Real eggs if he can find them. And he remembers the morning before everything changed.

The morning they were still whole.
