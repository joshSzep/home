## Premise

**Earth, 3025.** After a thousand years of trying, humanity has accepted the truth: we are forever earthbound. No faster-than-light travel. No wormholes. No exodus to the stars. This is it. This is home.

Then, on an ordinary day, an astrophysicist in Antarctica detects an asteroid. 

Calculations are verified. Trajectories confirmed. Impact in fifteen years.

It cannot be stopped.

This is the story of humanity's final countdown—not a tale of heroic solutions or miraculous escapes, but an intimate exploration of how people face the end when there is no way out. Seven interconnected lives across a transformed Earth: a scientist who detected it, a mayor who cannot save anyone, a parent who chooses life anyway, a builder who maintains what will end, a seeker who travels for answers, a fighter who loses faith, and an elder who has practiced for this her entire life.

Fifteen years. That's all that's left.

How do you spend it?

## The World

**Earth 3025** is humanity's prison and paradise. Confined by physics itself—the Five Prisons that bound us to this world and mortality—we've built a civilization that works within constraints:

- **Antarctica** is the megacity, home to over 4 billion people after climate catastrophe
- **Temperate zones** (former deserts, Siberia) are habitable, vibrant
- **Old cities** are underwater or abandoned
- **Technology** is advanced but bounded—no AI singularity, no fusion, no FTL
- **Forever Earth** is accepted doctrine: this is home, forever

Until it isn't.

## The Characters

Seven points of view across fifteen years:

- **Dr. Amara Okafor** — The Detector: First to see the data, first to know we're doomed
- **Mayor Elena Torres** — The Leader: Most powerful human on Earth, utterly powerless
- **Zara Okafor-Mensah** — The Parent: Has a second child after detection—defiant, loving
- **David Chen** — The Builder: Maintains solar arrays that will end anyway
- **Kenji Torres** — The Seeker: Travels the world searching for how to live fifteen years
- **Ibrahim al-Rashid** — The Fighter: Muslim warrior whose holy war loses all meaning
- **Professor Mei-Lin Wei** — The Elder: Has practiced for death her entire life
Connected by blood, work, chance, and choice—they converge in Antarctica for the end.

## Themes

**Impermanence** — Everything arises, everything passes  
**Meaning without permanence** — What matters when nothing lasts?  
**Community in crisis** — Connection when everything fractures  
**Acceptance without resignation** — Facing the end with clarity  
**The human response to cosmic indifference** — Physics doesn't care, but we do

This is Buddhist philosophy meets hard science fiction. Humanist values confronting absolute limits. A meditation on mortality made collective and certain.

## About the Genre

This is **hard** science fiction—constrained by known physics, plausible technology, realistic human responses. But it's also philosophical fiction, more interested in how people make meaning than in the mechanics of asteroid deflection (spoiler: they can't).

Influences: Kim Stanley Robinson, Ted Chiang, Ursula K. Le Guin, Kazuo Ishiguro's *Never Let Me Go*, the quiet apocalypse tradition.

## Why "Home"?

Because after a thousand years of dreaming about the stars, we finally accepted: Earth is home.

Then we learned: home is temporary too.

Everything is.
