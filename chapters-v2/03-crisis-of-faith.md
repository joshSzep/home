# Chapter 3 - Crisis of Faith

Kenji Torres was running simulations when Dr. Okafor went pale.

It was past midnight—he'd been working late on his dissertation analysis, theoretical calculations for asteroid deflection scenarios. Academic exercises. The kind of work that assumed humanity had time to implement them.

Dr. Okafor sat at her workstation across the lab, reviewing data from the monitoring network. She'd been quiet for the past hour, which wasn't unusual. She was an intense mentor, demanding but fair, and she respected his need to work in focused silence.

Then she made a sound—small, sharp, like someone had punched her.

"Dr. Okafor?" Kenji looked up from his screen. "Are you okay?"

She didn't answer. Just stared at her display, her face draining of color.

Kenji crossed the lab. "What is it?"

She pulled up the data without speaking. Kenji looked at the numbers and understood immediately. He'd been studying asteroid threats for four years. He knew how to read trajectory plots, impact probabilities, deflection windows.

This was an extinction-level event.

Impact probability: 99.97%. Time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days.

"Can we stop it?" he asked, already knowing the answer but needing to hear it said.

"No."

The word hung in the air between them. Final. Absolute.

Kenji looked at the data again. Fifteen years. He'd be thirty-nine. His mother would be seventy-eight. They'd both die before reaching the age his father had died at—sixty-two, in a transit tunnel accident when Kenji was five.

His mother had told him over and over after his father's death: it wasn't fair, he was too young, they should have had more time. She'd grieved for years.

Now she'd lose her son too. And herself. And everyone.

"Your mother needs to know," Dr. Okafor said, her voice distant and clinical. The professional mask sliding into place. "I should call her."

"I'll go to her," Kenji said. He was already moving toward the door. "I need to see her anyway."

Dr. Okafor didn't argue. She turned back to her screens, making calls, following protocols. Being the competent scientist everyone needed her to be.

Kenji left her there and walked out into the night.

Halfway across the world, in the Jerusalem hills, the alert came during evening prayers.

Ibrahim al-Rashid knelt with his brothers in the militia camp, forehead pressed to the prayer mat, reciting the words he'd spoken five times daily since childhood. *Allahu Akbar.* God is greatest. The words were automatic now, worn smooth by repetition, but they still meant everything. Foundation, purpose, certainty.

The commander's voice interrupted them mid-prayer. "Brothers. Emergency broadcast. Everyone to the command tent. Now."

Ibrahim finished his prostration—you didn't interrupt prayers for anything less than immediate danger—then rose with the others. Around him, fighters exchanged confused glances. The oldest was twenty-five. The youngest, Ahmed, was seventeen.

They gathered in the command tent, thirty fighters, all watching the battered screen the commander had activated.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact probability 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years. Deflection not possible.

Ibrahim stared at the screen. Read the words again in Arabic, overlaid on images of trajectories and impact projections. The asteroid would hit the Pacific Ocean. The explosion would be catastrophic. Global extinction within months of impact.

Fifteen years.

"Is this real?" someone asked.

"The UN Monitoring Network confirmed it," the commander said. His voice was steady, but Ibrahim could see the tension in his jaw. "Multiple independent verifications. It's real."

Silence in the tent. Thirty fighters processing the same impossible information.

Ahmed, the seventeen-year-old, spoke up. His voice cracked. "Is this... is this Allah's will?"

The commander looked at him, then at all of them. "Everything is Allah's will."

The answer should have been comforting. Ibrahim had heard it his entire life. Everything happened according to God's plan. Human understanding was limited. Allah saw what they could not see.

But if this was Allah's will, what did it mean?

"Why?" Ibrahim heard himself ask. "Why would Allah—"

"We don't question Allah's wisdom," the commander said sharply. Then, softer: "This may be a test. Or judgment. Or part of a plan beyond our understanding. The imam will guide us."

###

Antarctica was waking to the news.

As Kenji walked through the streets of McMurdo District, he watched the city fracture in real-time. Emergency alerts flashing on every screen. People stumbling out of buildings, comms pressed to their ears, faces stunned. Someone was shouting. Someone else was crying. In an alley, he saw a man bent over, vomiting.

The end of the world sounded like chaos.

Kenji walked through it in a strange bubble of calm. His mind was working too fast, processing too many things at once. Fifteen years. That was 5,475 days. He'd already spent 8,760 of them on a PhD that now meant nothing. He'd been planning a career studying asteroids, learning to detect and deflect them.

They'd detected one. Couldn't deflect it.

His entire field of study rendered pointless in one night.

But that wasn't what bothered him most. What bothered him was the sudden, terrible clarity: he didn't know how to live fifteen years. He'd been living like he had eighty years, maybe a hundred with modern medicine. Planning far ahead. Building toward a future that had just evaporated.

How did you live when there was no future to build toward?

He found himself outside the mayoral complex. Security was chaos—people demanding access, demanding answers, demanding his mother fix this. She couldn't fix this. She was the most powerful person on the continent and she couldn't do anything.

Kenji used his old access code and slipped in through the private entrance. Went up to her office. She wasn't there—in an emergency meeting somewhere.

He pulled out his comm and called her directly.

She answered after three rings. Her face on the screen looked exhausted, older than he'd ever seen her. "Kenji."

"Mom. Dr. Okafor just detected it. I saw the data. I'm at your office. Can you—"

"Come home. To my residence. I'll meet you there as soon as I can. Are you okay?"

"I don't know."

"I'm in an emergency council meeting. Give me twenty minutes. Go to the residence and wait for me."

"Okay."

He went to her residence—the small apartment she'd lived in since his father died. Let himself in with his access code and waited in the living room, surrounded by photos of their family. His father, young and smiling. Himself as a child. His mother in her mayoral robes at various ceremonies.

All of them ghosts now. His father already dead. The rest of them waiting.

###

Ibrahim found the imam in his tent, already deep in prayer.

The elderly spiritual leader who'd blessed Ibrahim when he joined the militia three years ago looked grave but calm when he finally rose.

"Brothers," he said to the gathered fighters. "What we have learned today is difficult. But remember: death was always certain. We have always known that we would die. The asteroid changes only the timing. Our faith remains."

"But everyone will die," someone said. "Muslims, Christians, Jews. Everyone. Even the innocent. Even children."

"Allah's justice is perfect," the imam said. "We may not understand it in this life. But in paradise, all will be clear. Those who have faith will be rewarded. Those who died in jihad will have the highest stations. The asteroid does not change this."

Ibrahim wanted to believe him. Needed to believe him. His entire life had been built on the certainty that God was watching, that the struggle mattered, that righteousness would be rewarded.

But a small voice whispered: *If everyone dies, who wins? If the holy land is vaporized, what were we fighting for?*

He pushed the voice away and went back to his tent to pray.

Ibrahim prayed for three hours straight. The evening prayer he'd interrupted. Additional voluntary prayers. Prostrated himself before Allah and asked for understanding, for faith, for the strength to accept what he couldn't comprehend.

The prayers felt hollow.

Not the words themselves—they were the same words he'd always prayed. But the feeling behind them was different. Usually when he prayed, he felt connected to something vast and certain. Felt the presence of Allah, the rightness of his path, the meaning of his struggle.

Tonight, he felt nothing.

Just his forehead against the mat, his own voice in his ears, and a terrible silence where God's presence should have been.

###

Elena arrived at her residence eighteen minutes after Kenji's call.

She came through the door and Kenji stood to meet her. She looked devastated—professional mask cracking at the edges. When she saw him, something broke completely and she pulled him into an embrace.

He was taller than her, had been since he was fifteen, but in that moment he felt small and terrifyingly mortal.

"I don't know what to do," she whispered into his shoulder.

Kenji pulled back to look at her. "You don't have to know. You just have to—"

"Be the mayor? Project certainty? Give people hope?" Elena laughed bitterly. "There is no hope, Kenji. In fifteen years we're all going to be dead. You're going to be dead at thirty-nine. I'm going to be—" She stopped. "Seventy-eight. If I make it that long."

"Then what?" Kenji asked. "We just give up?"

"I don't know." Elena stepped back, straightening her jacket. Professional distance trying to reassert itself. "I have to address the city at dawn. Six AM. Less than two hours. I need to figure out what to say."

"Tell them the truth."

"The truth is we're all going to die."

"Then tell them that." Kenji's voice was strained but steady. "You can't fix this, Mom. Nobody can. So just... be honest. Tell them what's happening. Don't pretend you have answers you don't have."

Elena looked at him—her brilliant, searching son who'd been asking questions about meaning for months, as if he'd sensed something was coming.

"I don't know how to lead through this," she admitted.

"You'll figure it out. You always do."

"Stay," she said. "Stay while I prepare this. I don't want to be alone right now."

"Okay."

They sat together at her kitchen table while she drafted her speech. Kenji made tea, brought her food she didn't eat, just sat with her while she tried to find words for the impossible.

At 5:45 AM, she stood and smoothed her jacket. "It's time."

"I'll be there," Kenji said. "In the council chamber. I'll be there."

She squeezed his hand and they walked together through the pre-dawn darkness.

###

The raid went ahead the next day.

Ibrahim strapped on his gear, checked his weapon, moved through the pre-combat rituals with automatic precision. Some of the fighters had deserted in the night. Just left. The camp was quieter, emptier.

Those who remained loaded into the transport. The ride to the Christian militia position was tense and silent. Usually before a raid there was nervous energy, jokes, prayer. Today there was nothing.

They hit the position at dawn.

The fighting was brief and brutal. The Christians were as disorganized as Ibrahim's own unit—the asteroid had broken everyone. Some fought with desperate fury. Some didn't fight at all, just surrendered or ran.

Ibrahim killed two men. Shot them at close range, watched them fall. He'd killed before. It had always felt justified, necessary, righteous. He was defending the holy land. Fighting for Allah.

Today it felt different.

Today it felt meaningless.

After the raid, Ibrahim searched one of the bodies—standard procedure, looking for intelligence. The man had been young, maybe twenty. Palestinian Christian, based on the medallion around his neck.

And prayer beads.

The Christian had been praying too.

Ibrahim stared at the beads in his hand. This man had believed he was righteous. Had believed God was on his side. Had fought and died for his faith just like Ibrahim was fighting for his.

Now he was dead, and Ibrahim was alive, and in fifteen years they'd both be dead anyway along with everyone else.

Who had been right? Who had God favored?

Or had God been watching at all?

Ibrahim dropped the beads and walked away. Found a place behind the transport and vomited until there was nothing left.

###

Three days after the detection, Kenji went to see his mother again.

She was in her office—where else?—surrounded by screens showing city systems, crisis reports, resource allocation models. She looked exhausted. Hollowed out.

"Mom."

She looked up, surprised. "Kenji. I thought you'd gone home."

"I've been staying at my apartment. But I can't—" He stopped. "I can't keep doing this. Going to classes, pretending research matters. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters."

Elena stood and came around her desk. "What are you saying?"

"I'm dropping out. My PhD is pointless. I've been studying how to save the world from asteroids and now one's coming and we can't stop it. What's the point of finishing?"

"Kenji—"

"I don't know how to live fifteen years, Mom. I don't know how to be present for this. I've been planning for a future that doesn't exist and now I don't know what to do."

Elena pulled him into another embrace. "None of us do. We're all trying to figure this out."

"I might leave," he said quietly. "Not forever. Just... travel. Try to find something that makes sense. Try to learn how to live when there's no future."

She pulled back, fear crossing her face. "Leave Antarctica?"

"Maybe. I don't know yet. I just know I can't stay in that lab calculating deflection scenarios that don't work."

Elena was silent for a long moment. Then: "If you need to go, go. But come back sometimes. Please. I don't want to lose you before—" Her voice broke.

"I will. I promise."

###

Six months later, Ibrahim sat in his tent holding two sets of prayer beads.

His own. And the Christian ones from the man he'd killed.

He'd tried to pray. The words wouldn't come.

Instead, he thought: *We both believed. We both prayed. We both thought God was watching, keeping score, judging righteousness. We killed each other over land that will be destroyed, following faiths that gave us different certainties about the same God.*

*And in fifteen years, none of it will matter.*

The thought was terrifying. It threatened everything Ibrahim had built his life on. Without faith, without certainty, without the holy struggle, what was left?

But he couldn't push it away anymore.

The doubt had won.

###

Six months later, Kenji stood in his apartment, packing a bag.

He'd spent the time since dropping out trying hedonism—parties, drugs, desperate attempts to feel something. It hadn't worked. He was still hollow. Still lost. Still counting down to extinction without knowing how to live the countdown.

He looked at the transport ticket on his screen. Lagos. Professor Wei's address, given to him by a former classmate who'd studied there.

An old philosopher, he'd heard. Someone who'd spent a century learning how to be present. How to live with impermanence.

Maybe she'd have answers. Maybe she wouldn't. But Kenji had to look.

He sent a message to his mother: *I'm leaving. Going to Lagos. Looking for a teacher. I love you. I'll come back.*

Then he picked up his bag and left Antarctica behind, searching for some way to make fifteen years mean something.
