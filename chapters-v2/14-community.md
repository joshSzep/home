# Chapter 14 - Community

Kenji Torres stands in the abandoned classroom, looking at empty desks arranged in rows for students who won't return.

McMurdo District Educational Complex, designed for ten thousand students, now serves maybe three hundred. Most classrooms sit dark. Most buildings evacuated. The teaching staff fled years ago—to family elsewhere, to smaller communities, to anywhere except here.

But the children remain. And children need teaching. Need community. Need someone to witness their brief existence.

Kenji volunteered.

Year 10. Five years until impact. He's thirty-two years old. Not trained as teacher. No credentials. Just: someone who learned from Professor Wei about presence, about impermanence, about making moments matter.

He rearranges the desks. Circle instead of rows. Twenty chairs. The students arrive tomorrow—ages six to fourteen, final generation, children who will never be adults. He needs to teach them: something. Not for future careers. Not for lasting knowledge.

Just: to make their now richer.

The classroom has windows overlooking the ice shelf. Solar panels stretching endlessly. Sky bright with polar summer sun. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful.

Kenji writes on the board: "Welcome. We're learning to be present."

Tomorrow, he'll start.

###

The first day, seventeen children show up.

They're wary—suspicious of this new teacher, this man who claims no expertise, who arranged desks in a circle like they're equals. Most teachers left years ago. The ones who stayed teach mechanically, maintaining curriculum no one needs.

Kenji sits in the circle with them. "Hi. I'm Kenji. I'm not really a teacher. But I learned things from someone wise, and I thought maybe you'd want to learn them too."

"What kind of things?" A girl, maybe ten, defiant.

"How to be present. How to observe without clinging. How to make moments matter."

"That's not real school," a boy says. "That's just... philosophy."

"You're right. It is philosophy. Buddhism specifically, but not as religion—as observation. As practice." Kenji leans forward. "You know math. You know reading. You know the curriculum. What you might not know is how to be alive right now. How to be here. How to make the time you have matter."

Silence. The children exchange looks—uncertain, curious, defensive.

"Why do you care?" the defiant girl asks. "Why teach us anything? We're dying. What's the point?"

"Professor Wei—my teacher—asked me that once. I asked her why flowers bloom. She said: because they're alive now. That's the point. You're alive now. This moment matters."

"For how long?" A small boy, six or seven, voice trembling.

"Five years. Then we all die together."

The honesty lands hard. Most adults avoid directness. Pretend. Soften. But Kenji learned from Wei: children know. Pretending insults them.

"So what do we do?" the defiant girl asks. "For five years?"

"We practice being alive. We learn presence. We make our now as rich as possible. We witness each other. We matter to each other." Kenji smiles. "And we do it together. Community. That's the whole point."

The children are quiet. Considering. One by one, they settle. Stay.

By the end of the hour, all seventeen are listening.

Tomorrow, more will come.

###

Lagos, Year 10, three million people remaining.

Maya Okafor-Mensah stands in the ruins of old Lagos, twelve years old and serious, staring at flooded streets where buildings used to rise. Her mother crouches beside her. Her brother Kofi, eight years old, climbs on rubble, fearless.

"Why are we here?" Maya asks.

"Because this is history," Zara says. "Because this is where people lived. Where they loved and worked and raised children. It's underwater now, but it mattered. They mattered."

"But why show us?" Maya's voice is sharp with intelligence and grief. "We'll never be historians. We'll never teach anyone else."

Zara touches her daughter's face gently. "Because it matters anyway. Because knowing where you come from matters. Because witnessing matters. Because you matter. And everything you know, everything you learn, everything you carry—that matters too. Even if it's brief."

"Everything is brief," Maya says.

"Yes. But that doesn't make it meaningless."

Kofi jumps from rubble to rubble, laughing. Still young enough to live in the present. Maya feels the weight crushing—the knowledge, the grief, the impossible question: why exist at all?

"Come on," Zara says. "Let's go see Professor Wei. She'll have better answers than me."

###

Professor Wei sits in her garden, under the lemon tree, eyes closed. Not meditating—just resting. She's 124 years old. Her body is failing. Zara helps her with daily tasks—bathing, dressing, moving from bed to chair. Wei's mind stays sharp, but her body prepares for the end.

Individual death. Before the collective death. The old way of dying.

"Grandmother Wei!" Kofi runs ahead, stops himself before crashing into her. "We went to the old city! It's all water!"

Wei opens her eyes slowly. Smiles. "Did you swim?"

"No! Mama said it's dangerous. But I wanted to."

"Of course you did. You're eight. Eight-year-olds should want to swim in dangerous water."

Maya sits beside Wei more carefully. "Why do we learn history if there's no future?"

Wei looks at Zara—a glance that says: *this is your daughter, brilliant and struggling.* Then to Maya: "Why do flowers bloom if they're going to die?"

"Because they're alive now," Maya says automatically.

"Yes. Because they're alive now." Wei touches Maya's hand. "You're alive now. Learning history makes you more alive. Understanding your ancestors, where you came from, what they built—that enriches your now. Even if your now is brief."

"But it feels pointless."

"Pointless and meaningful aren't opposites. Many meaningful things are pointless. Love is pointless. Beauty is pointless. Learning is pointless. They don't achieve anything permanent. They just: matter while they happen."

Maya is quiet. Processing. Always thinking. Already carrying weight no child should carry.

Through the kitchen window, Zara watches her daughter lean against Wei's frail shoulder. Sees Wei's ancient hand on Maya's young head. Sees comfort passing between them.

This is what Zara wanted. Community. Love. Presence. People who make her children's brief lives meaningful.

Professor Wei has been grandmother, teacher, guide. Showing Maya and Kofi how to be present, how to accept impermanence, how to bloom even while dying.

Wei is dying. Not from the asteroid—from age, from time, from natural death that still exists for a few more years.

Zara is grateful for it. Grateful the children will experience individual loss before collective loss. Grateful Wei will die peacefully, ready, showing them how it's done.

Grateful and devastated.

###

Week two of teaching, Kenji's class has twenty-three students.

Word spread. This new teacher who's honest. Who sits with them. Who admits he doesn't have answers but offers presence instead.

Today's lesson: observation.

"Close your eyes," Kenji says. "Listen. Don't analyze or judge. Just: listen."

The children close their eyes. The classroom is quiet except for: wind against windows, distant hum of machinery, someone's breathing, the building settling.

"What do you hear?" Kenji asks.

They share observations. Wind. Breathing. Silence. Not trying to mean anything. Just: noticing.

"That's it," Kenji says. "That's presence. You're here. You're noticing. You're alive in this moment. It's simple. But most people never do it. They're always somewhere else—in the past, in the future, in their thoughts. But right now: you're here."

A boy raises his hand. "Is that all? Just listening?"

"That's the foundation. From here, you can practice presence with anything. Walking. Eating. Talking. Loving. Being present makes everything richer. Makes your now matter more."

"Even if our now is short?" the defiant girl—her name is Sarah—asks.

"Especially then. Wei taught me: impermanence doesn't negate meaning. It intensifies it. You have five years. Make every moment count by being fully present for it."

Sarah nods slowly. "Okay. I can try that."

"We all can. Together. That's why we're here."

###

That evening in Lagos, Zara sits with Kwame on their small porch.

"Maya asked why we teach them," Zara says.

"What did you say?"

"That it matters anyway. That brief doesn't mean meaningless." She leans against her husband. "Do you think that's true?"

"Yes. I think it's the only truth." Kwame kisses her head. "We chose to have them. We chose to love them. We chose to make their brief lives as rich as possible. That was right."

"Was it?"

"Zara." He turns her to face him. "I've never regretted Maya or Kofi. Not once. Not even knowing. They're the best thing we ever did."

"But they're dying."

"We're all dying. We were always dying. They're just dying sooner than we pretended they would." Kwame takes her hands. "Would you trade it? Would you undo having them?"

"Never."

"Then we did right."

Zara closes her eyes. Breathes. Her husband's steady presence. Her children sleeping inside. Professor Wei dying next door. Lagos breathing around them.

"Amara confirmed Year 15," Zara says. "She wants us to come to Antarctica. All of us. Meet her and David. Be together at the end."

"Good. The children should see the megacity. Should meet their aunt properly. Should know where their mother came from."

"You think we can make it? The transport systems are barely functioning."

"We'll make it. We have to. Five years to plan. We'll make it work."

Inside, Maya and Kofi breathe in sleep. Next door, Wei breathes shallow and slow. Around them, Lagos lives—music from somewhere, voices calling, the constant hum of humanity existing until it can't.

"I'm scared," Zara whispers.

"I know."

"Not of dying. Of them dying. Of watching them die. Of that moment when—"

"I know. Me too."

"How do we bear it?"

"Together. Like everything else. Together."

###

Month three of teaching, Kenji leads the class outside.

Antarctica's polar summer—sun circling endlessly, ice shelf stretching forever, solar arrays functioning beautifully toward no future. Twenty-six students now. They walk together, silent, practicing presence.

"What do you notice?" Kenji asks.

"Cold," someone says.

"Light."

"The wind sounds different here."

"My breath makes clouds."

"I notice we're walking together. Community."

Kenji smiles. "Yes. Community. We're not alone. We're together. That matters."

They reach the nature preserve—transplanted ecosystem, trees and grass and flowing water, maintained for beauty's sake even though beauty's ending. The class sits in a circle on the grass.

"Professor Wei had a garden," Kenji says. "In Lagos. She grew gardenias. They bloomed and died. She said: the asteroid doesn't change this. Everything was always temporary."

"But flowers come back," Sarah says. "We don't."

"True. But the blooming still matters. Your blooming still matters." Kenji looks at each student. "You're alive now. You're learning now. You're present now. That's not nothing. That's everything."

A small boy—the six-year-old from the first day, name is Marcus—says quietly, "My parents left. They said there's no point staying. But I wanted to stay. I wanted... I don't know. Community. People who aren't giving up."

"You're brave," Kenji says.

"I'm scared."

"You can be both. Brave and scared. Present and frightened. Loving and grieving. You hold everything at once. That's what being human is."

The class sits together in the preserve. Twenty-six children, one teacher, all dying, all choosing presence anyway.

Community.

###

One morning, Professor Wei asks Zara to help her to the garden. The walk is slow—Wei's legs barely support her, breathing labored. But she insists on sitting under the lemon tree, in the morning light, flowers blooming around her.

"I'm dying," Wei says simply.

Zara's chest tightens. "I know."

"Soon. Maybe months. Maybe weeks. Not years."

"You don't know that—"

"Zara. I'm 124 years old. I know." Wei smiles gently. "I'm telling you because you need to prepare. Maya and Kofi need to prepare. This will be their first death. Their first individual loss before the collective loss."

"They love you."

"I love them too. That's why I'm telling you. They'll grieve. That's good. Grief means love happened. But then: they keep living. Keep being present. Keep blooming until they can't."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. "I don't know how to do this."

"Yes you do. You've been doing it since detection. Loving fiercely despite knowing it's brief. Being present despite knowing it's temporary. That's all grief is—love persisting after loss."

Wei touches Zara's face—frail hand, gentle pressure. "Thank you for caring for me. Thank you for letting your children love me. Thank you for making my last years beautiful."

"You made ours beautiful too."

"Good. Then we're even."

They sit in the garden—old woman and younger woman, philosopher and engineer, grandmother and mother by choice. The flowers bloom. The lemon tree drops fruit. Lagos lives.

Everything temporary.

Everything precious.

Everything enough.

###

Month four, Kenji's mother visits the class.

Elena Torres stands at the back of the circle, watching her son teach. Twenty-eight students now. They practice breathing together. Observing silence together. Being present together.

Afterward, walking back to her apartment, Elena says, "You're good at this."

"I don't know what I'm doing."

"That's why you're good. You're not pretending to have answers. You're just: present. With them. That's what they need."

They walk through the mostly-empty district. Year 10, five years left. Elena still maintains symbolic governance. Kenji teaches presence. Both doing what they can.

"The other teachers think I'm wasting time," Kenji says. "They're teaching calculus, literature, engineering. Real skills. I'm teaching... breathing. Observation. Presence."

"Which is what they actually need," Elena says. "They already know the world is ending. They don't need more calculus. They need to know how to be alive until they can't be."

"You think I'm helping?"

"I know you are. I see it in the children. They're less frightened. More connected. More present. That's everything."

Kenji stops. Hugs his mother. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For supporting this. For letting me try. For not forcing me to be someone else."

"You're exactly who you need to be," Elena says. "Wei taught you well."

###

Week later in Lagos, Zara takes a family portrait.

Her, Kwame, Maya, Kofi—and Professor Wei, sitting in the center, frail but present. They gather in Wei's garden, under the lemon tree, everyone smiling despite knowing this might be the last photo.

Maya asks to take one of just Wei. Wei agrees. Maya photographs her—ancient face, kind eyes, gentle smile. The image of someone ready, someone at peace, someone who lived fully and is prepared to die completely.

Later, Maya shows Zara the photo. "Can we print it? So I remember her after—"

"Yes. We'll print it."

"Will I forget what she looks like?"

"Maybe. Eventually. But you'll remember what she taught you. How she made you feel. The wisdom she shared. That stays."

"How do you know?"

"Because I remember my grandmother. She died when I was seven. I barely remember her face. But I remember her hands—how she touched my hair, how she held me. I remember her voice—how it sounded when she said my name. That's what stays. The love. Not the details."

Maya nods, processing. Then: "I'm glad we know her now. Even if it hurts later."

"Me too, baby. Me too."

That night, Zara frames the portrait. Hangs it in their living space—five people, three generations, loving despite everything.

Proof they existed.

Proof they mattered.

Proof love happened here.

###

Month five, planning the Antarctica trip, Maya asks Zara: "Will Grandmother Wei come with us?"

Zara's chest tightens. "No, baby. She'll be gone by then."

"Dead?"

"Yes."

"Before the asteroid?"

"Yes. Individual death. The old way of dying."

Kofi looks up from his drawing. "Is that better? Or worse?"

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "She'll die alone. We'll die together. Both are hard. Both are okay."

"I don't want her to die alone," Maya says.

"She won't be alone. We'll be with her. As much as we can."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Zara pulls her children close. These brilliant, doomed, precious humans she chose to create. Who will die in five years. Who will never be adults. Who matter absolutely.

"I love you both so much," Zara whispers.

"We know, Mama," Maya says.

"We love you too," Kofi adds. "Even when you're sad."

"I'm not sad. I'm grateful."

"You can be both," Maya observes. "Like Grandmother Wei teaches. Hold everything at once."

"Yes. Exactly like that."

###

Year 10 becomes Year 11.

In Antarctica, Kenji's class has thirty-one students. They practice presence daily. Walk together. Sit in silence. Share observations. Build community.

One day, Sarah asks: "Will you stay with us? Until the end?"

"Yes," Kenji says. "I'm not going anywhere."

"Promise?"

"Promise. We're together. All of us. Until we can't be."

The class sits in their circle. Thirty-one children, one teacher, all temporary, all choosing presence, all mattering to each other.

Community built on impermanence.

Love practiced despite dying.

Moments made rich through attention.

In Lagos, Maya and Kofi grow. Wei grows frailer. Zara and Kwame plan their journey to Antarctica. Five years becoming four.

In Antarctica, Elena governs symbolically. Amara and David maintain arrays together. Ibrahim learns to walk without fighting. Kenji teaches presence.

Everyone doing what they can.

Everyone being present.

Everyone making now matter.

Four years left.

Four years to bloom.

Four years to love.

Four years to be community.

Not enough.

But everything.

The children sit in circles. The portrait hangs in Lagos. The flowers bloom in Wei's garden. The sun circles Antarctica's summer sky.

Everyone temporary.

Everyone precious.

Everyone choosing presence.

Together.

Always together.

Until they can't be.

And even then, the love remains.

Has to.

It's all there is.
