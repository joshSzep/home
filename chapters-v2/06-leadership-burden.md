# Chapter 6 - Leadership Burden

The party has been going for three days.

Kenji Torres wakes up in someone's apartment—he's not sure whose—surrounded by bodies. People passed out on couches, on the floor, tangled together. The air smells like sweat and smoke and chemicals.

He sits up slowly. His head throbs. Someone next to him stirs—a girl, maybe twenty-two. She blinks at him. "What time is it?"

"Four in the afternoon."

"What day?"

"Tuesday. I think."

She laughs—hollow, brittle—and closes her eyes again. "Doesn't matter."

No. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters.

That's the point of these parties. To stop thinking about the asteroid. To drown the existential terror in substances and noise and bodies.

Kenji steps over people, finds the bathroom, looks at himself in the mirror. Twenty-five years old. Eyes bloodshot. Face gaunt. He's lost weight in the six months since dropping out.

Stopped eating regularly. Stopped sleeping normally. Started going to parties like this one.

Started trying to feel anything other than terror.

It's not working.

He splashes water on his face and leaves without saying goodbye to anyone.

###

The morning briefing has five people in it.

Used to be thirty. Department heads, security chiefs, infrastructure coordinators, communications directors. The full apparatus of city governance.

Now it's Elena Torres, two remaining department heads, a security officer who looks dead behind the eyes, and her assistant Marcus, who's stayed for reasons Elena doesn't fully understand.

The rest quit, fled, or died.

"Infrastructure report," Elena says, trying to maintain the ritual.

Chen, the infrastructure coordinator, pulls up data. "Power grid at 67% capacity. Water systems at 81%. Transport at 42% and dropping. We're losing maintenance crews daily. Automation is holding systems together, but when something breaks, we can't always fix it."

"Food distribution?"

"Adequate for now. Global supply chains are fracturing. We have six months of reserves. Maybe eight if we ration."

"Security?"

The officer shakes his head. "Crime is up 340%. Response time increasing. Most officers abandoned posts. We're down to skeleton crews. Property crime we're basically ignoring."

Elena nods. Expected this. Has been watching the slow collapse for eight months.

"Birth rates?"

Marcus pulls up data. "Seventeen births this month. Three hundred eighteen deaths. Twelve confirmed suicides. Population declining rapidly."

Eight months ago, McMurdo District had four million residents. Now three million. By next year, two.

People leaving, dying, giving up.

Elena can't blame them.

"Thank you. Same time tomorrow."

They file out. Marcus lingers. "The council wants to know if we're still maintaining education systems."

Elena laughs bitterly. "Education? So children can learn mathematics they'll never use? We're educating them to die."

Marcus is quiet. Then: "Some parents want schools open. They want their children to have normalcy. Whatever time they have left."

Elena softens. "You're right. I'm sorry. Yes, keep schools open as long as we can. Tell the council we're maintaining all essential services."

"What defines essential?"

"I don't know anymore. Anything that helps people live with dignity until the end."

###

Kenji wanders through the Antarctica district where he grew up.

The megacity looks different now. Emptier. Some buildings abandoned. Some systems failing. Graffiti everywhere—FOURTEEN YEARS LEFT. NOTHING MATTERS. FUCK THE ASTEROID. WE'RE ALREADY DEAD.

The streets are quieter. Some people fled. Others died—suicide mostly, though some violence, accidents. The rest trying to survive.

Or trying to forget.

Kenji passes three different parties. Midday parties. Endless parties. The hedonism economy booming—anything to numb the terror.

He could join any of them. Could disappear into another three-day binge.

Instead, he keeps walking.

He finds himself at the Nature Preserve District. He and his mother used to come here when he was a child. She'd point out species, tell him their names, explain their relationships.

Before she became Mayor. Before everything fell apart.

Kenji sits on a bench watching engineered birds fly between engineered trees. Everything here maintained. Everything artificial. Everything temporary.

In fifteen years, all of this will be gone.

Him. His mother. Everyone.

He thinks: I've wasted six months trying to escape this thought. How many more months will I waste? How many of my fifteen years will I spend numb and hollow?

The question sits in his chest, heavy and urgent.

###

That night, Kenji goes to see his mother.

Elena is in her office—where else?—surrounded by screens showing crisis reports, resource allocation models. She looks exhausted. Hollowed out.

"Kenji." She stands when he enters. "I didn't know you were coming."

"Neither did I."

They hug awkwardly. They haven't been close in months. She's been buried in managing collapse. He's been buried in parties.

"How are you?" she asks.

"Terrible. You?"

"Same." She gestures at the screens. "Birth rates collapsed. Suicide rates climbing. Infrastructure failing. Wars breaking out globally. I'm supposed to govern this. Make it orderly." She laughs bitterly. "For what? So they can die in fourteen years instead of now?"

Kenji has never heard his mother sound like this. Elena Torres, the steady hand. The woman who always had a plan.

She sounds broken.

"Are you okay?" he asks.

"No. But I show up anyway. Because what else is there?" She looks at him. "What about you? I heard you've been partying."

"Trying to escape. Didn't work."

"Did you think it would?"

"I didn't think. I just—I couldn't be in that lab anymore. Couldn't calculate orbits when none of it matters. Couldn't pretend research had a future."

Elena sits heavily. "Nothing has a future. But we're alive now. That's something, isn't it?"

"Is it? Is being alive now enough when we know exactly how it ends?"

"I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out. Some days I think I'm succeeding. Most days I think I'm just stalling."

They sit in silence. Mother and son, both drowning, neither knowing how to save the other.

Finally, Kenji says, "I want to leave."

Elena looks up sharply. "Leave where?"

"Antarctica. Travel. Find people who have answers. Or at least different questions. I can't stay here. Can't party myself to death. Can't pretend university matters. I need to find some way to live these fifteen years that isn't numbing out."

"Where would you go?"

"I don't know. Lagos, maybe. Mumbai. Jerusalem. Wherever people are still trying to make sense of this."

Elena's face closes. "It's not safe. The world's fracturing. Wars, collapse, violence."

"Nowhere's safe. We're all dying anyway."

"I don't want to lose you before the asteroid."

"You're losing me here, Mom. I'm wasting away. At least if I'm traveling, I'm searching. At least I'm trying."

She's quiet for a long time. The mother wanting to protect. The leader knowing she can't control everything. The human realizing control was always illusion.

"Okay," she says finally. "Go. Find what you need to find. But Kenji—" She takes his hand. "Come back. Eventually. Don't die alone somewhere far away. We have fifteen years. I want to spend some of them together."

"I will. I promise."

They embrace—a real embrace. He feels her shaking slightly. Realizes she's crying.

"I love you," he says.

"I love you too. Be careful. And Kenji? Find something worth finding."

###

Two weeks later, a riot breaks out in the southern district.

Started over food distribution—someone claimed shipments were being hoarded. Probably not true, but truth doesn't matter when everyone's scared and angry.

Three hundred people in the streets. Looting. Breaking windows. Setting fires.

Elena calls security. "Send response teams."

The officer on duty says, "We don't have response teams. Most units are at 30% capacity. They're not going to risk their lives to stop a riot. Not when we're all dying in fourteen years anyway."

"Then send what we have."

"Mayor Torres, with respect—let them riot. What does it matter?"

Elena closes her eyes. "It matters because people are getting hurt. It matters because we don't have to descend into chaos just because the world is ending. Please. Send who you can."

"I'll try."

He doesn't sound confident.

Elena grabs her security detail—two officers who still report for duty—and goes herself.

The southern district is chaos. Smoke rising. People running. Glass shattered. Someone's overturned a transport vehicle.

Elena climbs onto an abandoned market stall. Her security detail activates crowd amplification.

"Citizens! Please! Stop!"

Some people pause. Most keep rioting.

"I know you're angry! I know you're scared! But destroying our own city won't change that! We still have fourteen years! We still have to live together! Please!"

Someone shouts: "You can't save us!"

"I know," Elena says. "I know I can't save you. I can't stop the asteroid. I can't give you a future. But I can try to maintain some dignity until the end!"

Another voice: "Why? What's the point?"

"Because we're still alive! Because we don't have to spend our last years tearing each other apart! Because—" Her voice breaks. "Because it matters. Even if it doesn't change anything. It matters."

The crowd quiets. Not from agreement. Just exhaustion. The riot burns itself out.

Elena climbs down. Her hands are shaking.

Back at her office, she sits in the dark.

Thinks: I have no power. I have no authority. I have nothing but the empty performance of governance.

Thinks: What am I doing?

###

Kenji arrives in Lagos in the middle of the night.

The megacity is different from Antarctica. Warmer, more chaotic, more alive. Streets crowded even at 2am. Markets operating. Music playing. People living loudly.

He finds a hostel and collapses into sleep.

The next morning, he starts asking questions.

Where are the philosophers? The spiritual teachers? The people who know how to live with death?

Buddhist monks tell him about impermanence. Humanists talk about creating meaning. Christians offer salvation through faith. Sufis speak of surrender and divine love.

Everyone has a different answer. No one has *the* answer.

But Kenji keeps asking. Keeps searching.

Three months into his travels, he meets a woman in a Lagos market selling water purification tablets.

"You're searching for something," she says.

"How can you tell?"

"You have the seeker look. My son had it too. Before he killed himself." She packages his tablets. "You should talk to Professor Wei. An old philosopher. Lives in Yaba District. Very wise. She doesn't give answers exactly. But she helps you find better questions."

Kenji takes the address.

###

Three months after the riot, Elena receives a letter.

Physical paper, elegant handwriting.

*Dear Mayor Torres,*

*My name is Professor Mei-Lin Wei. I am a philosopher living in Lagos. Your son Kenji has been studying with me these past months.*

*I write because I sense you are struggling with questions of purpose and power. Your son mentioned that you continue to govern despite collapse.*

*I want to tell you something I have learned in 116 years: You cannot hold chaos together. Civilizations fall. This is not a failure of leadership. It is the nature of reality.*

*But you can witness it with dignity.*

*You can perform the rituals of governance not because they will succeed, but because performing them with integrity is itself meaningful. You can show up not because it changes anything, but because showing up is who you are.*

*This is not powerlessness. This is acceptance.*

*Power was always temporary. You are learning what comes after power.*

*Presence. Witness. Dignity.*

*Keep showing up. Not because it saves anyone. But because it is who you are.*

*With respect,*  
*Professor Mei-Lin Wei*

Elena reads the letter three times. Then cries.

Not grief crying. Relief crying.

Someone understands. Someone sees what she's trying to do.

She writes back immediately.

*Professor Wei,*

*Thank you. I needed to hear this. I've been questioning why I continue, whether leadership means anything when there's nothing to lead toward.*

*You're right. I can't hold it together. But I can witness it. I can show up with dignity.*

*Thank you for teaching my son. You've given him something I couldn't.*

*Elena Torres*

They begin a correspondence that will last years. Letters about power and powerlessness. About meaning and meaninglessness. About showing up when showing up seems futile.

The letters keep her sane.

###

Professor Wei's house is small. The garden is immaculate—flowers, vegetables, a lemon tree heavy with fruit.

The old woman sits on a bench, impossibly small and frail, watching a child play near the lemon tree. The girl is maybe four—running, laughing, utterly absorbed.

Kenji approaches carefully. "Professor Wei?"

She looks up. Her eyes are sharp. "Yes?"

"My name is Kenji Torres. Someone told me you speak with people who are trying to make sense of this."

"The asteroid?"

"Yes."

"Sit."

The child runs over. "Grandmother Wei, who's that?"

"A young man seeking wisdom. Go play, Maya."

The girl runs back to the lemon tree.

Wei turns to Kenji. "What do you want to know?"

"How do you live fifteen years? How do you make them matter?"

"What have you been doing?"

"Partying. Drugs. Trying to numb everything. It didn't work. So now I'm traveling. Looking for teachers."

"And what have you learned?"

"That everyone has a different answer. That no one really knows. That I'm still just as lost."

Wei smiles. "Good. You're learning that seeking outside yourself won't give you what you need. The answers aren't out there. They're in here." She taps her chest. "You have to make your own meaning. No one can give it to you."

"But I don't know how."

"Neither does anyone else. We're all making it up. The asteroid just forced us to admit it. Before, we could pretend life had inherent meaning. Now we can't. So we have to create it. Consciously. Deliberately."

The little girl—Maya—is singing to herself. A made-up song about lemons.

"She's beautiful," Kenji says.

"Yes. She'll die at seventeen. Her mother knows this. Still loves her completely. That's meaning-making. Choosing to love what you'll lose."

Kenji feels something crack in his chest. "How do you do that?"

"How did you love before? Everything you ever loved was going to end. The asteroid just made the timeline visible. But love was always temporary. You loved anyway. You can still love anyway."

He starts crying. Real tears. Real grief. Real presence.

Wei sits with him. Says nothing. Just present.

After a while, Kenji asks, "Can I come back? Learn from you?"

"I don't teach. I'm too old. But you can visit. We can talk. This path is harder than numbing out. You'll have to sit with the grief. With the terror. You'll have to feel all of it."

"I'm tired of being numb."

"Then come back tomorrow."

###

Six months after Kenji leaves, Elena sits in her office late at night.

The building is empty. Just her, reading reports that barely matter.

Kenji calls.

His face appears on screen, from Lagos. He looks good—healthier. Centered.

"Mom. How are you?"

"Tired. You?"

"Better. Learning a lot. Professor Wei is extraordinary."

"I've been corresponding with her. She's given me more wisdom than I found in twelve years of governance."

Kenji smiles. "She has that gift. Clarity. Perspective."

"How much longer will you stay there?"

"A while longer. I'm not done learning. But I'll come home eventually. I want us to have time together before—"

"Before we die," Elena finishes.

"Yeah."

They're quiet. Then Elena says, "I'm glad you left. I was scared. But I'm glad. You found something. You're alive in a way you weren't before."

"I was drowning. Now I'm swimming. Still in deep water. But swimming."

"Me too. I was trying to control the uncontrollable. Now I'm just present. Showing up. Bearing witness. It's easier."

"Professor Wei said: 'The asteroid didn't make life meaningless. It made the pre-existing meaninglessness visible. Now you can stop pretending and start choosing.'"

Elena thinks about it. "She's right. I spent twelve years pretending leadership mattered because it built toward lasting future. Now I lead because leading with integrity is intrinsically valuable. Not because it changes anything. Just because it's who I am."

"That's wisdom, Mom."

"No. That's exhaustion. But I'll take it."

They talk for another hour. When the call ends, Elena feels less alone.

She's still governing ruins. Still showing up to maintain a system that's collapsing.

But she's not drowning anymore.

She's bearing witness.

And somehow, that's enough.

###

One year after detection, they're both still learning.

Kenji in Lagos, sitting in Wei's garden daily, learning to be present. Learning that meaning is made, not found. Learning to sit with grief without drowning.

Elena in Antarctica, showing up every morning to govern a dying city. Learning that power was always temporary. Learning that bearing witness with dignity is its own meaning.

Both finding their way through the collapse.

Both choosing to live instead of waiting to die.

It doesn't solve anything. Doesn't stop the asteroid. Doesn't give them more time.

But it gives them this: presence. Purpose. Something like peace.

Fourteen years left.

Then thirteen years, eleven months.

The countdown continues.

They continue with it.

Apart but connected. Learning different lessons from the same teacher.

How to live when there's no future.

How to mean something when nothing lasts.

How to bloom in autumn.
