# Chapter 20: Maintenance

Year 15. Eighty-seven days until impact. The countdown is exact now, visible on every working screen in McMurdo District.

David Chen climbs platform 73 as he has for thirty years—two hundred meters above Antarctica, solar arrays stretching in all directions, robot 47B working faithfully beside him. The systems still function at ninety-four percent capacity. The robots still maintain their protocols. The power still flows.

Why continue? He's asked himself this for fifteen years.

The answer: because someone should. Because persistence matters even when outcomes don't. Because the work is holy even when nothing lasts.

He checks connections Maya helped him inspect yesterday. Amara's niece—seventeen, brilliant, about to die—climbs the platform daily now. Learning everything. Absorbing knowledge she'll never use. But curiosity matters even when there's no future.

Robot 47B completes another repair cycle. Chirps affirmation. Moves to the next task. It doesn't know the asteroid's coming. Doesn't know anything except: maintain function. Continue protocol.

Simple. Pure. Honest.

David envies this sometimes—the not knowing, the pure function without meaning-making. But knowing is burden and gift both. Burden: you see the ending. Gift: you choose how to face it.

He chose work. And Amara. And family. And presence.

Not bad choices. Real enough.

Below, Antarctica spreads white and eternal. Above, the sky holds no visible threat. But the screens know. The calculations know. Eighty-seven days.

Less than three months. Enough time to matter. Not enough time for regret.

David returns to the checklist. Not because the systems need him—they're automated, resilient, designed to outlast their creators. But because showing up matters. Because bearing witness matters. Because maintenance is meditation when done with presence.

Wei taught that, though David never met her. The teaching spread like seeds. Kenji learned it. Zara learned it. Everyone learned it. Now: David lives it.

Twenty-two years married. Ten years broken. Five years healed. Eighty-seven days left.

The equation is brutal. But the five years were real. That has to count.

Eighty-four days. Kofi arrives with Kwame, Zara's husband.

The boy is thirteen—bright-eyed, energetic, entirely present in a way David envies. "Uncle David! Can I help again? Can I touch the robots? Can I learn the protocols?"

Kwame looks apologetic. "He's been asking since dawn. I told him we needed to check first."

"He can help," David says. "Carefully. But yes. Come, Kofi. I'll show you."

They climb together, three generations of presence: the engineer who learned it late, the father who learned it for his children's sake, the boy who never knew any other way.

David shows Kofi the simple tasks—checking connections, reading displays, monitoring robot behavior. The boy absorbs everything with unfiltered joy. No existential dread. No paralysis. Just: curiosity. Interest. Being here.

"Why do the robots keep working if everyone's dying?" Kofi asks.

"They don't know we're dying. They just know: maintain function. That's their purpose."

"Do they have feelings?"

"No. Just protocols. They execute without emotion."

"Is that better?"

David considers. "Different. Not better or worse. Just different. They work without suffering. We work with meaning. Both are valid."

Kofi touches robot 47B carefully. It continues its task, unaware. Boy and machine. One conscious, one not. Both here. Both real.

"I like them," Kofi says. "They're honest."

"Exactly. No pretense. No meaning-making. Just: function."

Kwame watches his son with fierce, impossible love. Thirteen years old. Eighty-four days left. Every father's nightmare made precise and numerical.

But he's here. Present. Teaching his son how to be curious even at the end. That's courage David barely comprehends.

"Thank you," Kwame says quietly. "For including him. For making him feel like he matters."

"He does matter. You all matter. That's why Amara invited you. Family matters. Presence matters. That's everything."

They work together—man, man, boy, robots—all maintaining systems that will die in weeks. All present anyway. All mattering now.

When Kofi asks why David wants to be on the platform at the end, David answers honestly: "Because this is where I worked. Where I showed up. Where I maintained systems alongside machines. It feels right to witness from here. With your aunt. With work that mattered even when it seemed meaningless."

"Did it matter?" Kofi asks. "If everything ends?"

"Yes. Because mattering isn't about outcomes. It's about presence. I was present. For thirty years. That's enough."

Seventy-nine days. Ibrahim climbs platform 73.

David knows him from community gatherings—the former fighter who lost his faith and found something better. Thirty-two years old. Carries himself with a dignity that comes from having survived belief's collapse.

"Kenji said you might need help," Ibrahim says. "I'm not engineer. But I can follow instructions. Thought you might want company."

David considers refusing—the work is solitary, meditative, his anchor. But: yes. Company sounds right. Presence multiplies presence.

"I could use help," David says. "Nothing technical. But the manual labor—someone to hold things, move equipment, be present. That would help."

They work side by side. Ibrahim follows David's instructions precisely, asks good questions, learns quickly. The physical work seems to ground him—carrying panels, steadying equipment, being useful.

During a break, Ibrahim asks: "Why still maintain? You know it ends. Why not just... stop?"

"Same reason you climbed fifty-three steps to get here. Same reason Kenji counts fifty-three breaths. The number's arbitrary. The attention is real."

Ibrahim nods slowly. "Maintenance as prayer."

"Something like that. I don't pray. But the work—when done with presence—it's holy. Secular holy. Real holy."

"I used to pray five times daily," Ibrahim says. "Twenty-seven years. Structure. Connection. Way of being deliberate. Made moment matter."

"Do you still?"

"No. Can't pray to something I don't believe in. But I found something else. This." He gestures at the platform, the work, the presence. "Being here. Paying attention. Making task matter. Same function. Honest this time."

They work in comfortable silence. Engineer and former fighter. Both using work as meditation. Both present to the end.

Robot 47B chirps completion. Moves to next task. Faithful. Unaware. Continuous.

"They'll outlast us," Ibrahim observes. "By seconds. But they'll keep working after we're gone."

"Yes. Until they can't. That's beautiful somehow."

"Why?"

"Because they don't make meaning. They just: function. Pure. Honest. Present. Like prayer used to be for you. Like work is for me."

Ibrahim considers this. "Wei taught presence. Kenji taught acceptance. You teach through maintenance. Same truth. Different languages."

"Were you angry?" David asks. "When you lost faith? When certainty shattered?"

"For years. Felt betrayed. By God. By imams. By myself for believing. Then: Elena showed me dignity persists without belief. Kenji showed me presence persists without certainty. Slowly, the anger became... honest. Honest is enough."

"Five more years and you would have become peaceful."

Ibrahim laughs—bitter, real. "Yes. Wei died peaceful at 126. I die uncertain at thirty-two. Not enough time. But: the learning was real. That counts."

David thinks of his own timeline. Fifty-four years old. Thirty years of work. Ten years of distance from Amara. Five years healed. Not enough time for any of it. But: the five years were real. The thirty years of maintenance were real. The presence, finally learned, was real.

That has to count.

Sixty-eight days. Maya arrives with questions.

She's been climbing the platform daily, absorbing everything about the solar arrays, the power systems, the automated maintenance protocols. Her mother's brilliant analytical mind combined with youth's fearless curiosity.

"Uncle David," she says, breathless from the climb. "The robots will keep working until impact. But what about after? Will anything function? For how long?"

David pulls up the calculations. "Impact creates electromagnetic pulse. Destroys all electronics instantly. But the mechanical systems—the ones not dependent on circuits—they'll continue. Robot 47B will complete its current task. Maybe start the next one. Two, three seconds. Then: structural failure. Heat. Blast. Everything stops."

Maya processes this. "So they'll outlast us. By seconds. Still working while we're dying."

"Yes."

"That's what you want? To be working? Until you can't?"

"Not working. Being present. There's a difference. Work is just the structure. Presence is the content."

She nods. "Like Kenji's breathing. Like Mama's teaching. Like Grandma Wei's gardening. Structure doesn't matter. Presence does."

"Exactly."

They stand together on the platform, two hundred meters up, sixty-eight days left. Uncle and niece. Engineer and student. Both learning how to be present when presence is all that remains.

"I'm glad you and Aunt Amara reconciled," Maya says. "Mama told me you were apart for ten years. That must have been hard."

"It was. We both hid. Different ways. Same fear. But: we came back. That's what matters."

"Five years together after ten years apart. Is it enough?"

The question everyone asks. The question David asks himself every morning.

"It has to be," he says. "What else is there?"

Maya smiles—sad, beautiful, brief. Seventeen years old. Sixty-eight days left. Still learning. Still curious. Still present.

She's extraordinary. Zara chose life. Chose this girl. Against all advice. Against all fear. Against the logic that said creating doomed children was cruelty.

But Maya exists. Matters. Learns. Loves. Defies through being.

Brave. So brave.

Fifty-two days. David writes his final maintenance log.

Not required. The systems are automated. But: habit. Documentation. Bearing witness.

*Year 15, Day 313. Systems functioning at 93% capacity. Minor degradation in sectors 7, 12, 23. Automated repair protocols engaging. Robot fleet operating within parameters. Power generation sufficient for remaining population. Estimated functionality: until impact plus 2.3 seconds.*

*Personal note: I have maintained these systems for thirty years. They will outlast me by seconds. This seems right. We worked together—me and machines—maintaining function when function seemed meaningless. But function was never meaningless. It was presence. It was bearing witness. It was saying: while we're here, we maintain. We persist. We care.*

*The work is complete. The presence continues. For fifty-two more days. Then: 2.3 seconds more. Then: silence.*

*It was enough.*

*—David Chen, Senior Maintenance Engineer, Solar Division, Forever Earth*

He saves the file. For whom? No one. The AI will record it. Store it. Die with everything else.

But someone should document. Someone should say: we maintained. We cared. We were here.

That someone was David.

He stands on the platform. Looks at the arrays he's maintained for three decades. Looks at robot 47B completing another faithful cycle. Looks at Antarctica spreading white below and sky spreading blue above and sees: home. Work. Presence. Love.

Fifty-two days until it ends.

Enough time to matter. Not enough time for anything except mattering.

He thinks of Amara, waiting in their small house. Five years healed. Fifty-two days left. His wife. His witness. His choice.

He climbs down slowly, carefully, paying attention to each step. The ladder is real. The cold is real. The wind is real. Presence makes it all sacred.

At the bottom, Ibrahim waits. They've been working together for weeks now—the engineer and the former fighter, both using maintenance as meditation.

"Same time tomorrow?" Ibrahim asks.

"Same time every day," David says. "Until we can't."

"That's prayer," Ibrahim says. "Different words. Same truth."

They walk back toward McMurdo District together. The sun is setting—one of fifty-two sunsets left. The sky is orange and pink and purple and completely indifferent to human meanings.

But they're not indifferent. They care. They witness. They persist.

That's what makes them human. Not the surviving. The caring.

---

Forty-one days. The whole family gathers on platform 73.

Amara and David. Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi. Six people. Two hundred meters up. Wind cold. Sky clear. Asteroid invisible but approaching with mathematical precision.

They came to see the place David and Amara chose for their final witness. To understand. To be together. To share this moment when moments are becoming precious and countable.

"Why here?" Kofi asks. "Why do you want to be up here at the end?"

David looks at the solar arrays, the robots, the systems he's maintained for thirty years. "Because this is where I worked. Where I persisted. Where I showed up when showing up seemed meaningless. It feels right to witness from here. With Amara. With work that gave me structure when I was broken."

"Did it matter?" Maya asks. "The work? If everything ends?"

"Yes. Because mattering isn't about outcomes. It's about presence. I was present. The work was real. That's enough."

Zara says quietly: "Wei taught that. Different words. Same truth. You embodied it without knowing you were embodying anything."

"I was just showing up," David says. "Working. Continuing. But yes—that's presence. That's holy. That's everything."

They stand together, watching robot 47B complete another cycle. Watching the arrays generate power for a dying city. Watching the sun track across a sky that holds their ending.

"I'm glad you'll be here," Maya says. "You and Aunt Amara. Together. With your work. That's beautiful."

"Where will you be?" David asks, though he knows.

"The preserve," Zara says. "All four of us. With nature. With beauty. With each other. That's where we belong."

"Perfect," David says. "Different locations. Same moment. All witnesses. All choosing how to face it. That's the gift of knowing."

Amara adds: "Not comfort. Choice. That's everything."

They descend together. Family time. Final weeks. Presence multiplying through connection.

At the bottom, they embrace. Uncle and niece. Aunt and nephew. Sister and sister. Family by blood and choice and defiant love.

Then: Zara's family walks toward the preserve. David and Amara watch them go—four people choosing life until the end. Choosing each other. Choosing presence.

"They're remarkable," David says.

"They're Zara," Amara says. "Brave. Defiant. Loving despite everything."

They walk back to their small house. Hand in hand. Twenty-two years married. Ten years broken. Five years healed. Forty-one days left.

The equation is still brutal. But the presence is real. The love is real. The choice to witness together is real.

That has to be enough.

Twenty-seven days. David and Ibrahim sit together on platform 73 at sunset.

The work is done for the day. The robots continue their protocols. The systems hum faithfully. Below, Antarctica glows orange in dying light.

"Tell me about prayer," David says. "Real prayer. Before you lost it. What was it like?"

Ibrahim considers. "Structure. Connection. Way of organizing thoughts. Five times daily. Facing Mecca. Saying words that connected me to millions saying same words. Felt real. Felt meaningful. Felt like God was listening."

"Was He?"

"I don't know. Probably not. Probably no one there. But the praying was real. The community was real. The structure was real. That mattered even if God didn't."

"Do you miss it?"

"Sometimes. Miss the certainty. Miss feeling connected to something larger. But: I found something else. This." He gestures at the platform, the work, the sunset, the presence. "Being here. Paying attention. Making moment matter. Same function. Honest this time."

They sit in comfortable silence. Engineer and former fighter. Both learned presence through work. Both facing the end with dignity.

"Twenty-seven days," Ibrahim says. "Not enough time to become peaceful like Wei. But enough time to be present. That's something."

"It's everything," David says. "That's what the work taught me. Presence is enough. Outcome doesn't matter. Being here matters."

"Took you thirty years to learn that?"

"Took me fifty-four years. Only learned it in the last five. When Amara woke up. When she invited me to wake too. Before that: just functioning. Like the robots. Meaningless continuation."

"What changed?"

"Love, I think. Connection. Someone saying: be present with me. That changed everything."

Ibrahim nods. "Elena said that to me. Year 8, wounded, faithless, dying. She said: be present. Bear witness. Dignity persists even when belief doesn't. That saved me."

"Elena's remarkable. Still governing when there's nothing left to govern. Still bearing witness. Still showing up."

"Like you. Still maintaining when there's nothing left to maintain."

"We're all still showing up. That's what makes us human. The caring. The persisting. The being here anyway."

The sun sets. One of twenty-seven sunsets left. The sky cycles through its indifferent beauty.

Robot 47B completes another task. Chirps. Continues protocol. Faithful to the end.

"They'll keep working," Ibrahim says. "After we're gone. For seconds. Until they can't."

"Yes. That's their prayer. Function. Pure. Honest. Present."

"And ours?"

"This. Being here. Witnessing. Maintaining. Choosing presence when nothing else remains."

They descend together as darkness falls. Tomorrow: same work. Same presence. Same witness.

Twenty-seven days left. Then: together at the end.

But present now. Always present now.

The maintenance continues. The presence continues. The love continues.

For twenty-seven more days. Then: 2.3 seconds more.

Then: silence.

But present now. Always. Now.

David holds Amara that night and thinks: this is prayer. This is holy. This is everything.

Twenty-seven days.

Not enough time for anything except being here.

Exactly enough time for that.

The work taught him. The robots taught him. Ibrahim taught him. Amara taught him. Everyone taught him.

Finally, he learned.

Presence is enough. Being here is enough. Maintenance is holy when done with love.

The asteroid approaches with mathematical precision. The systems function faithfully. The robots work without knowing they're dying.

And David Chen, fifty-four years old, engineer, husband, witness, is finally, completely, present.

That's enough.

That's everything.

To the end.
