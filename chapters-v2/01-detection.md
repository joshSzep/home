# PART I: DETECTION

# Chapter 1 - Detection

The alert sounded at 3:47 AM.

Dr. Amara Okafor had been working the graveyard shift for twenty years—preferred it, actually. The Antarctic Monitoring Station was quiet at night, just her and the automated systems humming their patient watch over the sky. No colleagues stopping by to chat, no meetings, no ceremonial bullshit. Just data, tea, and the clean satisfaction of verification protocols completed.

She was reviewing asteroid 2024-KJ9's updated trajectory—a near-Earth object they'd been tracking for months, safely predictable—when the AI system chirped. Not the routine ping of an orbital correction, but the high-priority alert she'd heard maybe three times in her entire career.

New detection. Unusual signature. High-priority classification pending.

Amara set down her tea and pulled up the data feed.

For a moment, she didn't understand what she was looking at. The numbers were wrong—had to be. Size estimate in the catastrophic range. Velocity vector pointing directly at Earth's orbital path. Impact probability climbing as the AI refined its calculations: 94.3%... 96.1%... 98.7%...

She ran the verification protocols. They confirmed.

She checked for system errors. None detected.

She pulled the raw telescope data and analyzed it manually, her hands moving across the holographic display with the automatic precision of two decades' practice. Parallax measurements from three different monitoring stations. Spectral analysis. Brightness curve. Orbital mechanics.

The asteroid was real.

Mass: approximately 1.5 × 10^15 kg. Somewhere between ten and fifteen kilometers across. Civilization-killer scale. Coming at them at 28.3 km/s relative to Earth, at an angle that made gravitational assist from any inner planet impossible.

Impact probability: 99.97%.

Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days.

The station was very quiet. The automated systems hummed. Her tea was getting cold.

Amara's hands were shaking.

*Can we deflect it?* That was the question. That was always the question. The UN Monitoring Program existed not just to detect but to coordinate response. They had contingency plans. Deflection scenarios. Nuclear options, kinetic impactors, gravity tractors—

She opened the deflection calculator and started entering parameters.

Required delta-v for minimal deflection to miss Earth: 0.3 cm/s, but needed years earlier in trajectory.

She ran the scenarios one by one, methodically, the way she'd been trained. Nuclear deflection: would require coordinated detonation of Earth's entire arsenal, and even then—she checked the numbers again—insufficient yield. Kinetic impactor: would need to launch within six months, required spacecraft ten times more massive than anything humanity had ever built. Gravity tractor: too slow, would need fifty years minimum.

She ran them again, adjusting parameters, trying to find a way.

The numbers didn't change.

She tried different approach vectors, different deflection timings, different thrust profiles. Worked through the equations with the cold precision of someone who had spent her entire adult life studying orbital mechanics.

Every scenario ended the same way.

*Not possible.*

Thirty-two minutes had passed since the alert.

Amara Okafor sat alone in the monitoring station, surrounded by screens full of data, and understood: Earth had fifteen years left. Everyone on it—all eight billion people—was going to die. Including her. Including David. Including her sister Zara and little Maya.

And there was nothing she could do about it.

She picked up her comm and called Director Mbasa.

He answered after five rings, groggy. "Okafor? It's four in the morning—"

"We have an extinction-level asteroid," she said. Her voice sounded strange in her own ears. Calm. Clinical. Like she was reporting routine data. "Impact in fifteen years. I've run the deflection scenarios. None of them work."

Silence on the other end.

"I need you to verify my calculations," she continued. "But they're right. I've checked them six times. It's too big, too fast, too close. We can't stop it."

"Send me everything." His voice had changed—professional now, alert. "I'm coming in. Don't call anyone else until I verify."

"The AI has already distributed the data to the global monitoring network. It's flagged as extinction-level. The other stations will be seeing it now."

Another silence, longer this time.

"Christ," Mbasa said quietly. "Okay. I'm on my way. Okafor—are you certain?"

"Yes."

She ended the call and sat looking at the screens. The asteroid was designated 2025-AZ1 now, the AI having catalogued it properly. Just a string of numbers and letters. It didn't look like much on the display—a point of light following a plotted trajectory, one red line intersecting another.

In fifteen years, that point of light would strike Earth's atmosphere at over 100,000 kilometers per hour. The impact would release energy equivalent to several billion nuclear weapons. The shockwave would circle the planet. The debris cloud would blot out the sun for years. Nothing larger than a rat would survive.

Her comm lit up again. Mayor Torres.

###

Elena Torres had been awake since three AM, reviewing budget allocations for the McMurdo District water reclamation system—the kind of tedious, essential work that actually kept a city of four billion people alive. When the emergency line lit up on her desk comm with that priority tone that meant crisis, she'd known immediately something was very wrong.

She accepted the call. Dr. Okafor's face appeared, and Elena saw in an instant what this was about. Amara's composure was legendary—Elena had seen her brief the council on everything from solar flare impacts to facility accidents without a flicker of emotion. But now there was something in her eyes. A terrible clarity.

"Dr. Okafor," Elena said carefully. "I've received an alert from the monitoring network. Please tell me this is a false positive."

The pause before Amara answered told Elena everything.

"It's not."

Elena looked at the data Amara transmitted. Impact probability: 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. Classification: Extinction-level event.

She'd been mayor of Antarctica for twelve years. Managed cyclone season crises, infrastructure collapses, diplomatic incidents with other regional governments, even the Great Power Failure of 3023 that had left half the city dark for three days. She'd learned to stay calm in crisis. To project certainty even when uncertain. To make decisions with incomplete information.

But she'd never had to manage the end of the world.

"Can we deflect it?" Elena asked, already knowing the answer from Amara's expression.

"No."

"You're certain?"

"I've run every scenario. The mass, velocity, and time frame make deflection impossible with current technology. Even if we launched every spacecraft on Earth, even if we detonated our entire nuclear arsenal in a coordinated strike—it's not enough. We'd need at least thirty years and technology we don't have. We have fifteen."

Elena set down her stylus with careful precision. Her hands wanted to shake. She didn't let them.

"When will this become public knowledge?"

"The monitoring network has already flagged it as extinction-level. The AI systems are following protocol—verification from multiple stations, then global alert. I'd estimate within the next hour."

One hour. To prepare for the collapse of civilization. To figure out what she could possibly say to four billion people in Antarctica alone, eight billion worldwide. To find some way to maintain order when order had just become meaningless.

"I need to convene the emergency council. I need to prepare a statement." Elena's mind was already moving through protocols, procedures, chains of command. Then she stopped. For just a moment, the professional distance she'd cultivated for decades slipped, and she felt the raw enormity of it.

Everyone she knew was going to die. Everyone she was responsible for. Her son.

Kenji would die at thirty-nine years old.

Hiroshi had died five years ago at sixty-two. She'd felt the unfairness of it—they should have had more time. Now she thought: *You were lucky. You died not knowing.*

"Mayor Torres—Elena—" Amara's voice pulled her back.

"Yes?"

"Your son is in my lab. Kenji. He was working late on his dissertation analysis. He'll have seen the alert by now."

Kenji. Her brilliant, restless son who'd been studying astrophysics under Amara's mentorship. Who'd been asking questions about meaning and purpose for months, unsettled in ways she didn't fully understand. Who was about to learn that his future had just been reduced to fifteen years.

"Is he—" Elena's voice cracked slightly.

"I'll tell him to call you."

"Thank you." Elena ended the call and sat for a moment in the silence of her study. The mayor's seal on the wall behind her. Certificates and awards. Photos with world leaders and dignitaries. All of it meaningless now.

Her comm lit up again immediately. Emergency council requesting secure conference. She accepted, and her screen filled with faces—district leaders, security chiefs, heads of food production, energy, water, medical services. All the people who kept Antarctica functioning.

All of them looking at her for answers she didn't have.

"I assume you've all seen the alert," Elena said.

Chen Wei, head of East Antarctica District, spoke first. "Is this confirmed? Extinction-level?"

"Yes. I've spoken with Dr. Okafor directly. The asteroid is real, the trajectory is certain, and deflection is not possible with current technology."

Silence. Elena watched them process it. Some had been woken by the alert, were still in sleeping clothes. Others, like her, had been working through the night. All of them looked stunned.

"How long?" asked Sarah Kimathi, West District.

"Fifteen years."

"What are our options?" Marcus DaSilva, Security.

Elena wanted to laugh. It came out as a sharp exhale. "We have no options. That's the point. An asteroid the size of a mountain is going to hit Earth in fifteen years and we can't stop it."

"There must be something—" DaSilva started.

"There isn't." Elena kept her voice level, authoritative. They needed her to be certain, even about this. "I will coordinate with the UN to verify independently, but Dr. Okafor is the leading expert in orbital mechanics. If she says we can't deflect it, we can't deflect it."

"Then what do we do?" Kimathi asked quietly.

That was the question, wasn't it? What did you do when you couldn't do anything?

"We maintain order," Elena said. "We keep the city functioning. We keep people fed, housed, safe. We have fifteen years to figure out how to face this with some measure of dignity."

Even as she said it, she knew how hollow it sounded. The global alert would go out any minute. Eight billion people learning they were going to die. How did you maintain order through that?

"The birth centers," Chen said suddenly. "The genetic design programs. We have thousands of pregnancies in progress, applications pending—"

"I know." Elena felt something twist in her chest. All those parents planning for their children's futures. Selecting genes for longevity, health, intelligence. Hoping to give their children the best chance at life in humanity's permanent home on Earth.

What was the point of designing a child to live to 150 when the world ended in fifteen years?

"We need to address the public immediately," Kimathi said. "Before panic spreads. If we don't provide clear information, clear leadership—"

"I'll prepare a statement. City-wide broadcast at dawn. Six AM."

"That's less than two hours—"

"Then I'd better start writing."

The meeting continued—logistics, contingencies, emergency protocols. Elena participated, made decisions, projected calm authority. Inside, she felt like she was standing at the edge of an abyss.

When the meeting finally ended, she had forty-five minutes to write a speech that would broadcast to four billion people in Antarctica and be rebroadcast globally.

*Good morning. Everyone's going to die. Please remain calm.*

Her comm chimed. Private line. Kenji.

She accepted immediately. Her son's face appeared—young, frightened in a way she hadn't seen since he was a child waking from nightmares.

"Mom."

"Kenji. Where are you?"

"Still at the lab. I saw the data. I thought—I thought there had to be a mistake, but Dr. Okafor says—" His voice broke.

"Come home. Right now. Come home."

"I'm on my way."

He arrived eighteen minutes later. Elena met him in the hallway and pulled him into an embrace. He was taller than her—had been for years—but in that moment he felt small and terrifyingly mortal.

"I don't know what to do," she whispered into his shoulder.

Kenji pulled back to look at her. "You don't have to know. You just have to—"

"Be the mayor? Project certainty? Give people hope?" Elena laughed bitterly. "There is no hope, Kenji. In fifteen years we're all going to be dead. You're going to be dead at thirty-nine."

"Then what?" Kenji asked. "We just give up?"

"I don't know." Elena stepped back, straightening her jacket. Professional distance reasserting itself. "I have to address the city in twelve minutes. I need to figure out what to say."

"Tell them the truth."

"The truth is we're all going to die."

"Then tell them that. You can't fix this, Mom. Nobody can. So just... be honest. Tell them what's happening. Don't pretend you have answers you don't have."

Elena looked at her son—her brilliant, searching son who'd been asking questions about meaning for months, as if he'd sensed something was coming.

"Stay," she said. "Stay while I do this."

"Okay."

###

The broadcast went live at 6:00 AM precisely.

Elena stood in the council chamber, alone except for the cameras and Kenji in the back of the room. Around Antarctica, screens activated in every home, every public space. Four billion people, most just waking to the worst news in human history.

Elena looked into the camera and spoke.

"Good morning. By now, many of you have seen the emergency alert from the UN Monitoring Network. I'm here to confirm that the alert is accurate and to tell you what we know.

"At 3:47 AM, our monitoring station detected an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The asteroid is approximately fifteen kilometers in diameter. Impact probability is 99.97%—effectively certain. Time to impact is fifteen years, two months, and fourteen days.

"Our best scientists have analyzed every possible deflection scenario. I wish I could tell you that we have a solution. I wish I could tell you that we're going to stop this. But I won't lie to you. The truth is we can't. The asteroid cannot be deflected with any technology we currently possess or could develop in the time available. When it strikes, it will cause an extinction-level event. Nothing will survive."

She paused. Across Antarctica, across the world, billions of people were processing these words. Children were being held by parents. Partners were reaching for each other. Some were crying. Some were in shock. Some were already preparing to riot.

"I don't have easy answers for you. I don't have a plan that will save us. What I can tell you is this: we have fifteen years. Fifteen years to decide how we want to spend the time we have left. Fifteen years to choose who we want to be in the face of this.

"The government will continue to function. We will maintain essential services as long as possible. Food distribution, power, water, medical care—we will keep our city running. We will keep people safe. We will maintain order.

"But I can't tell you what to do with your fifteen years. That's a choice only you can make. 

"I know many of you are afraid. I'm afraid too. I know many of you are angry. That's justified. I know some of you want answers I cannot give. I'm sorry.

"What I can promise is that we will face this together. That we will take care of each other. That we will find whatever meaning and dignity we can in the time we have.

"The asteroid is coming. We cannot stop it. But we can choose how we meet it.

"More information will be distributed throughout the day. Emergency services remain operational. If you need help, reach out. We're all in this together.

"Thank you."

The broadcast ended.

Elena stood in the empty council chamber, feeling the weight of four billion people watching, waiting, looking to her for guidance she couldn't provide.

Kenji came forward and took her hand.

"You did good, Mom."

"I told four billion people they're going to die."

"You told them the truth. That's all you could do."

Outside, through the windows, Elena could see the city waking to its new reality. Lights coming on in residential towers. People emerging onto streets and balconies. Some running. Some standing still. Some embracing.

The sun was rising over Antarctica. First light on the first day of humanity's final countdown.

Elena Torres, Mayor of the most populous district on Earth, utterly powerless to save anyone, watched dawn break on a world that had fifteen years left.

She squeezed her son's hand and wondered how they would possibly survive this.

Not the asteroid. That would kill them.

But the waiting. The knowing. The fifteen years of counting down to extinction.

How did anyone survive that?
