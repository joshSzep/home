# Chapter 15 - Wei's Passing

Mei-Lin Wei wakes to morning light filtering through curtains she no longer has strength to open.

Year 11. Four years until the asteroid. 125 years since her birth. Weeks—maybe days—until her death.

Individual death. The old kind. Before the collective ending.

She breathes slowly, carefully. Each breath deliberate. Her body is failing in the way bodies fail when they've lived too long—organs tired, bones brittle, muscles atrophied. She's been bedridden for months now. Zara helps her with everything: bathing, dressing, eating, moving from bed to chair to garden on good days.

Wei doesn't mind the dependence. She's had 125 years of independence. These final months feel right somehow. Full circle. Born helpless, dying helpless, living independent between.

The door opens quietly. Zara enters with breakfast—rice porridge, synthesized but warm. Maya and Kofi follow, thirteen and nine now, taller each time Wei sees them, growing despite knowing they won't grow old.

"Good morning, Grandmother Wei," Maya says formally. The girl has become serious. Carries weight. Knows too much too soon.

"Good morning, dear heart," Wei says. Her voice is thin, but clear. The mind remains sharp even as the body crumbles. That's biology's cruelty—awareness until the end.

Kofi climbs onto the bed carefully, trying not to jostle her. "Can we read to you today?"

"I would like that very much."

Zara helps Wei sit up—slow process, painful, necessary. Props pillows behind her. Sets the breakfast tray across her lap. Wei eats slowly. Everything is slow now. Eating, breathing, thinking. Time stretches differently when you're dying. Each moment lasting, each moment precious.

"What shall we read?" Maya asks, browsing Wei's bookshelf.

"Something with flowers," Wei says. "I miss the garden."

She can't go to the garden anymore. Can't sit under the lemon tree, can't touch the gardenias, can't feel soil under her fingers. The garden continues without her—Zara maintains it, the flowers bloom, the tree drops fruit.

Life continues when you can no longer participate.

This is good practice for what comes next. Letting go. Releasing. Allowing the world to exist without you.

Maya finds a poetry collection. Sits beside the bed. Reads in her clear young voice:

*"The cherry blossoms fall*  
*Even in spring, even in bloom*  
*Knowing their briefness."*

Wei closes her eyes, listening. Poetry is better than philosophy at the end. Truth distilled to beauty. Impermanence made lovely.

"Read another," she whispers.

Maya reads for an hour. Kofi falls asleep against Wei's side—warm small body, alive and temporary, precious beyond measure. Wei touches his hair gently.

Won't see him reach ten. Won't see Maya reach fifteen. Will die before them, individually, the old way.

This is mercy and tragedy. She won't watch them die in the asteroid's impact. But they'll lose her first, learn grief first, carry her absence into their brief remaining time.

Both mercy and tragedy. Both true at once.

###

That afternoon, Zara sits with Wei while the children play outside. Their voices float through the window—laughter, argument, the sounds of living.

"How are you?" Zara asks.

"Dying," Wei says simply. "Not today. But soon."

"Don't—"

"Zara. We've talked about this. I'm 125 years old. My body is finished. I'm ready."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. She's been caring for Wei for two years now—daily visits, constant help, endless presence. More than neighbor. More than friend. Family by choice.

"I'm not ready," Zara says.

"You don't have to be ready. Death comes whether we're ready or not. I'm ready—I've lived long enough to be ready. You're not, Maya's not, Kofi's not. That's okay. You'll grieve. Then you'll keep living. That's how it works."

"I don't know how to do this."

"Yes you do. You've been doing it since detection. Loving fiercely despite knowing it's brief. Being present despite knowing it's temporary. That's all grief is—love persisting after loss."

Wei reaches for Zara's hand. The gesture takes effort. Her arm barely lifts. But connection matters more than comfort.

"Thank you," Wei says. "For caring for me. For letting your children love me. For being my neighbor. You made my last years beautiful."

"You made mine meaningful," Zara says. "Your wisdom, your teaching, your presence. You showed us how to live with impermanence."

"I showed you what you already knew. You chose to have Kofi after detection. That was wisdom. I just gave words to what you understood."

They sit in silence. Outside, children play. Inside, old woman and younger woman hold hands, bearing witness to ending, to beginning, to the constant cycle of bloom and fade.

"Will you be here?" Wei asks. "At the end?"

"Yes. If you want me."

"I want you. And the children. I want to die with people I love nearby. That's the only blessing of individual death—choosing your witnesses."

"We'll be here."

"Thank you."

###

Weeks pass. Wei drifts more now—lucid moments fewer, sleep longer, the body preparing for final shutdown.

She dreams of her husband Chen, dead twenty-three years. Dreams of students she taught over seventy years of philosophy. Dreams of gardens, of flowers blooming and fading, of cycles continuing.

She wakes one morning knowing: soon. Days, maybe. Not weeks.

Zara helps her eat breakfast. Wei manages a few bites. Her appetite is gone. The body knows it doesn't need fuel for much longer.

"Zara," Wei says. "I'm dying soon."

"I know."

"Before the asteroid. Individual death. That still exists. Don't forget that." Wei breathes carefully. "Even with the asteroid, we each die our own death. You'll die with your children, together. I die alone. Neither is better. Both are death. Both are okay."

Zara is crying. Wei lets her. Grief needs expression. Holding it back poisons the spirit.

"You won't be alone," Zara says. "We'll be with you."

"Yes. But I go first. You stay. That's the hard part—staying. But you will. For Maya and Kofi. For Kwame. For yourself. You'll stay until you can't."

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. But I must. Like the flower. Blooming, fading. It's natural. Don't cling to me. Let me go."

"I don't know if I can."

"You can. You will. Because you're brave. Because you understand impermanence better than most. Because you chose life even knowing it's brief." Wei squeezes Zara's hand weakly. "You are my legacy. You and Maya and Kofi. My teaching continues through you."

"I'll teach them what you taught me."

"Good. Tell them: be present. Be kind. Don't cling. Accept what comes. That's all. That's everything."

"I will. I promise."

###

The next morning, Wei wakes lucid and clear. She knows: today.

The knowing is absolute. Today the body stops.

"Zara," she whispers.

Zara is beside her immediately. "I'm here."

"Today. It's today."

Zara's face crumples. Recovers. "What do you need?"

"The children. I want to say goodbye. And..." Wei pauses. "Will you help me to the garden? One last time?"

"Are you sure? The movement might—"

"I'm dying anyway. Let me die in the garden."

Zara nods. Calls Kwame. Together they lift Wei—so light now, barely anything, bones and spirit more than body. They carry her carefully to the garden, to the spot under the lemon tree where she's sat for decades.

They settle her in the old chair. Blankets around her. Morning sun warm on her face.

The gardenias are blooming. White and perfect. Temporary and beautiful.

Wei breathes deeply. Smells earth. Lemon. Flowers. Life.

"Thank you," she whispers.

Zara brings the children—Maya thirteen, Kofi nine, both growing despite knowing they won't grow old. They sit on either side of Wei's chair, close but careful.

"Grandmother," Maya says, voice breaking.

"Sweet girl. I love you. I'm so proud of you. So proud of your questions, your thinking, your being." Wei breathes slowly. "Be present. Even when afraid. Be present. That's all that matters."

"I'll try," Maya whispers.

"You will. You already do."

Kofi is crying silently. Wei touches his face with trembling fingers.

"Little one. Don't cry. Or cry—crying is good. But know: I'm okay. I'm ready. It's my time."

"Don't go," Kofi says. "Please don't go."

"I must. Like the gardenia. It blooms, then fades. That's natural. That's beautiful. You understand?"

Kofi nods, not understanding but accepting.

"Be kind," Wei says. "That's all that matters. Be kind to yourself, to others, to your mother and father and sister. Be kind. Can you do that?"

"Yes," Kofi sobs. "I'll be kind."

"Good. That's my brave boy."

Zara sits beside Wei, holding her hand. Kwame stands close, witnessing. The children press near. Love surrounds her.

Wei looks at them. Her family by choice. Her legacy. Her joy.

"Thank you," she whispers. "All of you. Thank you for letting me love you. For loving me. For being here."

"We love you, Grandmother," Maya says.

"I know. I feel it. That's everything."

Wei closes her eyes. Not sleeping. Just: resting. Preparing. Letting go.

The garden is quiet. Birds somewhere. Wind in the lemon tree. The constant hum of Lagos beyond the walls.

Her breathing slows. The body knows what to do. Lungs filling less. Heart beating slower. Systems shutting down in proper sequence.

Zara holds her hand. The children are close. Kwame stands witness.

This is good death. Natural death. Ready death.

Wei thinks of Chen. *I'm coming, my love. Wait a little longer.*

Thinks of students. *You learned well. Keep learning.*

Thinks of gardenias. *Bloom and fade. Bloom and fade. Perfect cycle.*

Thinks of Kenji. *The boy who sought and found by stopping. Tell him: he understood. Tell him the flower bloomed.*

Thinks of impermanence. *I was right. It's not terrible. It's true.*

Her breathing slows further. Gaps between breaths longer. The body releasing, the spirit releasing, everything releasing.

She feels the sun on her face. Smells the gardenias. Hears the children breathing.

One breath.

Another.

Another, smaller.

Then:

Space.

Stillness.

End.

###

Mei-Lin Wei dies at 125 years old, naturally, peacefully, surrounded by love, in her garden under the lemon tree, two years before the asteroid ends everything.

Individual death. Before collective death. Reminder that dying is personal, even when it's universal.

She lived fully. She taught constantly. She loved freely. She died ready.

The flower bloomed.

The flower faded.

It was enough.

It was everything.

###

In the garden, Zara weeps. Maya holds Kofi. Kwame stands with hand on Zara's shoulder.

They sit with Wei's body for an hour. Not rushing. Not hiding. Just: being present with death, with loss, with the natural ending.

"Mama," Maya says quietly. "What do we do now?"

"We keep living," Zara says. "We grieve. We remember. We carry her teaching forward. We keep living until we can't."

"Will we see her again? When we—"

"I don't know, baby. But if there's anything after, she'll be there. And if there's nothing, then she's at peace. Either way: she's okay."

Kofi touches Wei's hand—still warm, not quite gone. "She's so still."

"Yes. The body stops. But what she taught us—that continues. Through us. That's her legacy."

They sit together in the garden. The gardenias bloom. The lemon tree drops fruit. Lagos breathes around them.

Life continues when you're gone.

That's the lesson.

That's the truth.

That's the mercy and tragedy of it all.

###

They bury Wei in the garden she loved. Under the lemon tree. Simple ceremony. Just family—Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi. A few neighbors who knew her. No grand funeral. No crowds. Just: quiet goodbye to a woman who lived quietly, taught deeply, died naturally.

Maya reads poetry:

*"The cherry blossoms fall*  
*Even in spring, even in bloom*  
*Knowing their briefness."*

Kofi places flowers on the grave—gardenias, white and perfect, temporary and beautiful.

Zara speaks: "Professor Wei taught us impermanence. Taught us presence. Taught us that brief doesn't mean meaningless. She lived 125 years. We have four years left. Both are temporary. Both matter. Both are enough."

They stand together at the grave. Zara calls Amara in Antarctica—tells her sister that Wei passed peacefully, surrounded by love, in her garden.

"Tell Kenji," Zara says. "He loved her. He learned from her. He needs to know."

"I will," Amara promises. "I'm so sorry, Zara."

"Don't be sorry. She was ready. She lived fully. She died peacefully. That's everything we can ask for."

After, Zara sits in Wei's garden alone. The grave is fresh. The flowers bloom. Everything continues.

She feels the loss—hollow space where Wei's presence used to be. Grief sharp and necessary. Love persisting after the person is gone.

But also: gratitude. For knowing Wei. For learning from her. For having her in their lives, in their children's lives, for these final years.

"Thank you," Zara whispers to the grave. "Thank you for teaching us. Thank you for loving us. Thank you for showing us how to bloom despite dying."

The garden doesn't answer. But it doesn't need to.

The teaching continues.

The love remains.

That's enough.

###

That evening, Zara tells the children: "We'll maintain the garden. We'll keep the gardenias blooming. We'll care for what she cared for. That's how we honor her."

"For how long?" Maya asks. "Until—"

"Until we leave for Antarctica. Year 15. Then someone else takes over. Or no one. But while we're here: we care for it. We keep it alive."

"Because that's what she would do," Maya says.

"Yes. Exactly."

They stand at the window, looking at the garden. The grave. The flowers. The lemon tree.

Wei's body lies beneath. Wei's teaching lives forward.

Both true. Both okay. Both part of the cycle.

Kofi says quietly, "I'm glad she was our grandmother."

"Me too," Maya says.

"Me too," Zara echoes. "So glad."

###

In Antarctica, Amara tells Kenji.

She finds him at the classroom, after teaching. Sits with him. Takes his hands.

"Kenji. I have news. Zara called. Professor Wei passed away yesterday."

Kenji goes very still. "How?"

"Peacefully. Naturally. In her garden, surrounded by Zara and the children. She was 125. She was ready."

Kenji's eyes fill with tears. He doesn't speak for a long time. Just: sits, breathing, feeling the loss.

Finally: "She taught me everything. How to stop seeking. How to be present. How to let go."

"She taught many people. You were one of her students. Now you carry her teaching forward."

"I do. Every day. With the children here. I teach what she taught me."

"That's her legacy. That's what continues."

Kenji nods slowly. "Zara said anything else?"

"She said: the flower bloomed."

Kenji smiles through tears. "Yes. It did. Perfect and brief and true."

He sits in the empty classroom, feeling grief and gratitude intertwined. Wei is gone. Wei's teaching continues. Both true. Both necessary.

Outside, Antarctica functions. Inside, Kenji mourns.

And tomorrow, he'll teach. He'll gather his students. He'll share what Wei taught him.

He'll be present.

He'll honor impermanence.

He'll bloom until he can't.

That's legacy.

That's love.

That's enough.

###

Three days after Wei's death, Zara wakes to Maya sitting by her bed.

"Mama. I had a dream about Grandmother Wei."

"Tell me."

"She was in the garden. She said: 'Keep blooming. Even when afraid. Keep blooming.' That's all. Then I woke up."

Zara pulls Maya close. "That sounds like her. That's exactly what she would say."

"Do you think it was really her? Or just my brain?"

"Does it matter?"

Maya considers. "No. I guess not. Either way, the message is true."

"Yes. Either way, the message is true."

They sit together—mother and daughter, both grieving, both grateful, both carrying forward what Wei taught them.

Keep blooming.

Even when afraid.

Even when dying.

Keep blooming.

It's enough.

It's everything.

It's all that matters.

###

Four years until impact.

Three years until Zara's family migrates to Antarctica.

Individual death processed. Collective death approaching.

The garden blooms. The grave rests. The teaching continues.

Wei taught until she couldn't.

Now her students carry forward.

Teaching what she taught them:

Be present.

Be kind.

Don't cling.

Accept what comes.

Bloom while you can.

Fade when you must.

It's enough.

It's everything.

Always was.

Always will be.

Until it isn't.

And then—then it continues anyway, through others, through memory, through love that persists.

Wei's body lies still.

Wei's teaching lives forward.

That's legacy.

That's truth.

The flower bloomed.

Perfect.

Brief.

True.

Enough.
