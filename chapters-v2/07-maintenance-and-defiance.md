# Chapter 7 - Maintenance & Defiance

The platform is 200 meters above the ice.

David Chen stands at the edge of the maintenance platform, safety harness clipped to the rail. He looks down. Could unclip it. Could step off. Could fall.

Would take maybe seven seconds.

He stands there calculating. Terminal velocity. Wind resistance. Angle of impact. His engineer brain analyzes even this.

Then he steps back and returns to work.

Not because he wants to live. Not because he has hope.

Just because: what's the difference?

Jump now, die later. Both end the same way. Might as well finish the maintenance cycle.

The solar panel needs realignment. The connection joints need lubrication. David does the work mechanically, precisely. The way he's done it for eight years.

The way he'll keep doing it.

Because what else is there?

###

Maya is five years old. Kofi is two.

Zara watches them play in Professor Wei's garden—Maya showing her brother how to pick lemons, Kofi's small hands reaching up, tongue between his teeth in concentration.

"Gentle, Kofi! Like this."

"I doing it!"

"You're *doing* it," Maya corrects, then beams when he succeeds. "Good job!"

They're beautiful. Her children. Temporary and precious and doomed.

Maya will die at seventeen. Kofi at fourteen.

Twelve years left for Maya. Thirteen for Kofi.

The math is constant. Unavoidable. But right now, in this moment, they're alive. They're playing. They're here.

Zara has learned to hold both truths simultaneously. The grief and the joy. The ending and the present.

It's the hardest thing she's ever done.

###

One year after detection, David's maintenance division has lost half its workforce.

Some quit. Some fled. Some died—suicides mostly, though a few accidents. When you stop caring whether you live, accidents become more likely.

David keeps showing up.

His supervisor—Rodriguez—asks him during a shift: "Why are you still here?"

"Where else would I be?"

"Anywhere. This work doesn't matter anymore. The arrays will function for fifteen years and then they'll be vaporized. What's the point?"

David adjusts a connection joint. Checks voltage readings. "The point is they need maintaining."

"That's not a reason."

"It's the only reason I have."

Rodriguez is quiet. Then: "I'm quitting next week. Going to travel. You should too."

"I'm not a traveler."

"Then what are you?"

David doesn't have an answer. He's not anything anymore. Just someone who shows up, does work, goes home. Repeat.

Rodriguez quits the following week. Half the remaining crew follows.

David stays.

###

Two years after Kofi's birth, people still call Zara cruel.

Bringing a child into a dying world. Condemning him to a short life. Selfish. Irresponsible. Monstrous.

Zara heard all of it. Some to her face, more behind her back.

She didn't care.

Or rather—she did care, it hurt, but she didn't regret.

Because Kofi exists. Because Maya has a brother. Because their apartment is filled with life instead of waiting for death.

Because she chose defiance over resignation.

Watching Kofi toddle after his sister now, hearing him laugh, seeing him discover the world—she'd make the same choice again.

Even knowing it ends. Even knowing he'll die young.

She'd choose him every time.

###

At home, Amara is never there.

She leaves before dawn, comes back after midnight. Working sixteen-hour days. Trying to solve the unsolvable.

David understands. Work is her escape. Numbers don't feel. Numbers don't grieve.

But he misses her anyway.

They've been married nine years. Used to talk about having children someday. Used to make plans, dream about futures, laugh together.

Now they're ghosts living in the same apartment.

He tries, occasionally.

"Amara. Do you want dinner?"

"Not hungry. Ate at the facility."

"Should we talk?"

"About what?"

"About us. About—"

"I can't, David. Not now. I have to finish these calculations."

"They don't change anything."

"I know."

"Then why—"

"Because it's all I have. Please. Just let me work."

So he lets her work. Lets her disappear into equations. Lets the space between them grow.

He doesn't fight it. Doesn't demand connection.

Because what's the point of saving a marriage when everyone dies in thirteen years?

He just accepts it. Accepts the loneliness.

Accepts everything.

###

Professor Wei sits on her bench, watching the children with ancient eyes.

The old woman is one hundred seventeen now. Frailer than ever. She uses a wheelchair most days, though she insists on sitting in the garden when weather allows.

Zara pushes Wei's chair closer to the shade.

"Thank you, dear."

"They're getting so big," Zara says. "Maya's reading chapter books. Kofi knows his colors and numbers to twenty."

"You're teaching them well."

"I'm teaching them everything. History, math, science, philosophy. Languages—Maya's learning Mandarin. Art, music." Zara's voice catches. "I'm trying to fit a lifetime of education into twelve years for Maya. Thirteen for Kofi."

"Why?"

The question surprises Zara. "Because they should know things. Because knowledge is valuable—"

"Because you're still future-oriented," Wei says gently. "You're teaching them as if they'll use these skills. As if there's a life ahead where knowing Mandarin matters."

Zara sits heavily. "What else should I do? Let them grow up ignorant?"

"No. But perhaps teach them what matters for the time they have. Not skills for a future that doesn't exist. But presence for the present that does."

"I don't know how to teach that."

"You already are. Watch them."

Maya and Kofi are no longer picking lemons. Kofi found a caterpillar and is mesmerized. Maya crouches beside him, equally fascinated.

"Bug!" Kofi whispers.

"It's a caterpillar. It eats leaves and then turns into a butterfly."

"Magic?"

"Kind of. It's called metamorphosis."

They're completely absorbed. Not thinking about the asteroid. Not calculating time. Just: here, now, amazed by a caterpillar.

"They already know how to be present," Wei says. "They don't need you to teach that. They need you to not teach them otherwise. To let them stay in wonder instead of pulling them into grief."

"But they need to understand reality—"

"They know enough. Maya knows the world is ending. You told her truth. That's enough. Now let her be five. Let Kofi be two. Don't weight them down with adult grief they'll carry soon enough."

###

Six months later, David is alone on a platform when he has the thought again.

Jump. Just jump.

It would be so easy. Unclip the harness. Step off. Seven seconds.

He stands at the edge. The wind is sharp. Below, ice stretches endlessly. Above, sky is bright and cold and indifferent.

He thinks about Amara. Whether she'd care if he died. Whether she'd notice. She's so buried in work, so absent, so gone.

Maybe she'd feel relief. One less thing to worry about.

He thinks about his parents in Beijing. Dead ten years now. He was an only child. No siblings. No children. No close friends.

If he jumped, who would mourn?

The automated systems would flag the missing worker. A replacement assigned. The solar arrays would continue functioning.

That's all.

He stands there for twenty minutes. Calculating. Considering.

Then he steps back.

Not from courage. Not from hope. Not from revelation about the value of life.

Just from: why bother?

Dying now or dying later—same endpoint. The asteroid is coming. Jumping just moves the date up.

And thirteen years of maintaining solar panels is no worse than seven seconds of falling.

Both meaningless. Both empty. Both just time passing.

He might as well keep going.

He finishes the maintenance and goes home.

Amara isn't there.

###

That night, after both children are asleep, Zara sits with Kwame on their small balcony.

Lagos stretches below them—lights flickering, some districts dark. Less crowded than three years ago. Many fled. Many died. But enough remain. Life continuing stubbornly.

"They're scaling down the water treatment systems," Kwame says. "Not enough staff. They want me to choose which districts get priority."

"That's impossible."

"I know. But that's the reality. We can't maintain everything. So someone has to decide: which neighborhoods get clean water?"

"How do you choose?"

"I don't know. Population density? Areas with children? Random? It's all terrible."

"Are you going to quit?"

"And do what? Travel? Wait for death?" He shakes his head. "No. I'd rather keep working. Keep helping who I can. It's not enough. But it's something."

"That's our motto now. 'It's not enough but it's something.'"

They sit in silence. Below, someone is having a party. Music drifts up. Life happening.

"Amara called today," Zara says. "First time in six months."

"How is she?"

"Same. Still hiding in work. Still distant. I asked her to visit, meet the kids. She said she can't yet."

"She's wasting the time we have."

"I know. But I can't force her to live differently."

Kwame takes her hand. "You're not wasting time. You're choosing life. That matters."

"Does it? When it all ends anyway?"

"Yes. Because they're alive now. Because you love them now. Because temporary doesn't mean meaningless." He squeezes her hand. "That's what you've taught me. That's what Professor Wei teaches. That's what the kids know naturally. Presence matters even when nothing lasts."

Zara nods. Squeezes back. "I love you."

"I love you too. And I love what you're doing. With the kids. Teaching them. Not giving up."

"I'm terrified I'm doing it wrong."

"There is no right way to raise children when the world is ending. You're doing it with love. That's enough."

###

Three years after detection, David realizes something.

He's been working mostly alone. The maintenance division is down to twenty people for arrays that used to require two hundred.

But the work still gets done.

Because the automated systems are taking over.

Robots handle routine maintenance. AI diagnostics flag issues. Self-repairing mechanisms fix minor faults. The solar arrays were designed to be largely autonomous—human oversight was mostly redundant even before.

Now the redundancy is obvious.

David works alongside the machines. They don't talk. Don't complain. Don't despair.

They just function.

He finds strange comfort in this.

The robots don't know the world is ending. Or if they do, they don't care. They just execute their programming. Maintain the arrays. Keep systems running. Do the work because the work exists.

No existential crisis. No meaning-making. No grief.

Just function.

David starts to envy them.

One day, he's working with a six-armed maintenance robot. The robot works with perfect efficiency. No hesitation. No questioning. Just: identify problem, execute solution, move to next task.

"You don't care why, do you?" David says aloud. Not expecting an answer.

The robot continues working.

"You don't need a reason. You just maintain the arrays because that's your function. It doesn't matter that they'll be destroyed. You just do the work."

The robot completes its task and moves to the next panel.

David watches it. Thinks: That's the answer. Function without meaning. Work without purpose. Just: do what's in front of you.

Not enlightenment. Not wisdom.

Just: acceptance of meaningless function.

He finds strange peace in this.

###

Six months later, Maya asks the question Zara has been dreading.

They're at the ocean. Maya is splashing in waves. Kofi is building sandcastles. Kwame is helping him find shells.

Maya comes out dripping, smiling. Sits beside Zara on the blanket.

"Mama, when I'm grown up, I want to be a scientist like Auntie Amara."

Zara's heart stops.

"A scientist?"

"Yeah! I want to study the ocean. There are fish that live so deep they make their own light! I want to discover new ones—"

"Maya." Zara's voice is too tight.

Her daughter looks at her. "What?"

This is the moment. To tell her. To explain that she won't be a scientist. Won't be an adult. Won't grow up.

But Maya is five. She's happy. She's dreaming. She's being a child.

Zara thinks of Wei's words: *Let her be five.*

"That sounds wonderful," Zara says, forcing her voice steady. "The ocean is amazing. You'd be a great scientist."

Maya beams. "Will you help me learn about fish?"

"Of course."

Maya runs back to the water. Calls for Kofi. They splash together, laughing, alive.

Kwame looks at Zara. Sees the tears. Comes over.

"You told her she could be a scientist."

"I couldn't take that from her. Not today. She's five. She should get to dream."

"Even though—"

"Even though." Zara wipes her face. "Wei says they know enough. That they'll understand more as they get older. That I don't have to crush every hope before it's time. So I'm letting her dream."

They watch their children play in the ocean. Temporary. Precious. Here.

Twelve years left for Maya. Thirteen for Kofi.

But today—today they're just children at the beach. Discovering shells and fish and wonder.

That has to be enough.

###

Five years after detection, David and Amara are roommates.

Not married. Not partners. Not even really friends.

Just two people who share an apartment and occasionally see each other.

"Morning," she says when paths cross.

"Morning."

"Coffee?"

"Yes, please."

They drink coffee in silence. She checks her wrist display. He stares out the window.

"I'm going to the facility," she says.

"I'm going to the arrays."

"See you tonight."

"Maybe."

She leaves. He finishes his coffee alone.

This is their marriage now. Polite. Distant. Empty.

David doesn't even feel sad about it anymore. Doesn't feel anything really.

Just numb acceptance.

They're both surviving. Both functioning. Both going through motions.

Ten years left.

Time passing. Both of them waiting.

For what? For death. For the end. For the asteroid to make all of this irrelevant.

David goes to work. Maintains the arrays. Works alongside robots who don't question why.

Comes home. Eats. Sleeps. Repeats.

This is life now.

Not living. Just: not dying yet.

###

One evening, Zara finds Maya crying in her room.

"Baby, what's wrong?"

Maya looks up, face wet. "Sasha's family is leaving."

Sasha is her best friend. They've known each other since they were three.

"Leaving Lagos?"

"Going to India. Her parents want to see the temples before everything ends. They're leaving next week." Maya sobs. "I'll never see her again."

Zara sits on the bed, pulls her daughter close. "I'm sorry, sweetheart."

"Why do people leave? Why can't we all stay together?"

"Everyone is handling this differently. Some want to stay home. Some want to travel. There's no right way."

"It's not fair. We already don't have much time. Now I lose Sasha too?"

"I know. It's not fair. None of this is fair."

Maya cries against her. Zara holds her, lets her grieve. This is the reality—not just the asteroid death, but all the small deaths along the way. Friends leaving. People dying. Everything falling apart slowly before the final end.

"Mama, are we going to stay in Lagos?"

"Yes. This is our home. We'll stay here. Work here. Live here."

"Until?"

"Until it's time to go."

"Where will we go?"

Zara strokes her daughter's hair. "Maybe Antarctica. To be with Auntie Amara. With family. For the end."

Maya is quiet. Then: "Can Kofi and I bring our toys?"

"Yes, baby. You can bring your toys."

"Okay." Maya wipes her face. "Can I write Sasha a letter? Before she goes?"

"Of course."

Maya gets paper. Starts writing. Her seven-year-old handwriting careful and determined.

Zara watches her daughter write to a friend she'll never see again. Watches her choose connection despite loss. Watches her be brave.

And thinks: I'm doing something right. Despite everything. Despite the grief. Despite the ending.

I'm teaching them to love anyway.

To connect anyway.

To live anyway.

That has to be enough.
