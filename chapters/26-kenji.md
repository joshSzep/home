# Chapter 26: Kenji

The transport descends toward McMurdo District, and Kenji Torres sees home for the first time in seven years.

Antarctica spreads below—geometric megacity carved from ice, solar arrays stretching endlessly, architecture rising in precise patterns. It's smaller than he remembers. Emptier. Whole sectors dark. But still: home. Still: where his mother lives. Still: the place he ran from, seeking meaning everywhere except here.

He's thirty-two years old. He's been to Tokyo and Mumbai and Jerusalem and Lagos. He's sought pleasure and faith and enlightenment and peace. He found Professor Wei, who taught him the only thing worth learning: stop seeking. Be present.

Now he's coming home to practice it.

The transport lands. Kenji shoulders his pack—lighter than when he left, carrying less, needing less. He walks through the arrival terminal. It's mostly automated now. A few travelers. Skeleton staff. Year 10, five years until impact, everything running on momentum and habit.

He takes the transit to residential sector. His mother's address is memorized—the mayor's quarters, official residence, probably empty most of the time because Elena Torres works constantly, governing a dying city because someone has to.

At the building entrance, Kenji pauses. His hand hovers over the comm button.

What if she's angry? What if she can't forgive seven years of absence? What if—

He presses the button.

"Yes?" Elena's voice, tired and cautious.

"Mom. It's Kenji. I'm... I'm home."

Silence. Long enough that Kenji thinks maybe she disconnected, maybe she doesn't want—

The door flies open. Elena stands there—sixty-three years old, grayer than he remembers, thinner, exhausted, but her eyes: wide with shock and joy and relief.

"Kenji," she whispers.

"Hi, Mom."

She pulls him into her arms. Holds him so tight he can barely breathe. She's shaking. Crying. He wraps his arms around her and realizes: he's crying too.

"You came back," Elena says. "You came home."

"I'm sorry it took so long."

"You're here now. You're here."

They stand in the doorway, mother and son, seven years of distance collapsing into presence. Other residents pass by, politely ignoring the reunion. Inside the apartment, life continues waiting.

Finally, Elena releases him. Pulls him inside. The apartment is small—official quarters but modest. Functional furniture. Stacks of reports. Maps on the walls. A woman who lives for her work.

"Sit, please," Elena says, wiping her eyes. "I'll make tea. Are you hungry? I have—"

"Mom. Just sit with me. We don't need anything else."

Elena stops. Nods. Sits beside him on the couch. Takes his hands in hers.

"You look different," she says. "Quieter. Like you stopped running."

"I did. Finally."

"What changed?"

Kenji tells her. About Tokyo's empty pleasure. About temples where he couldn't force faith. About Ibrahim in Jerusalem—the fighter losing certainty. About returning to Lagos, to Professor Wei.

"She taught Buddhism as philosophy," Kenji says. "Not religion. Just: observation. Impermanence. Non-clinging. She had this gardenia in her garden. It bloomed and died, and she said, 'The asteroid doesn't change this. Everything was always temporary.'"

"She sounds wise."

"She was. She died Year 12. I heard a few months ago. Natural death, age 119." Kenji's voice catches. "She was ready. I wasn't. But she taught me... being present matters more than finding answers."

Elena squeezes his hands. "Did you find what you were looking for?"

"No. I learned to stop looking."

"That sounds lonely."

"It's not. It's the opposite. When I was seeking, I was alone—moving constantly, never settling, never connecting. Now I'm here. With you. With people I love. That's enough."

Elena's eyes fill with tears again. "I wasted so much time on power. On governance. On trying to maintain order in a dying world. I should have—"

"Mom. You did what you could. You held the city together. That mattered."

"Did it?"

"To the people who stayed. To the ones who needed structure. Yes, it mattered." Kenji touches her face gently. "And we have now. Five years. We didn't waste the end."

Elena pulls him close again. They sit like that for a long time—mother and son, reconnected, present, home.

---

The first week back, Kenji relearns Antarctica.

He walks the districts—residential, commercial, civic. Everything still functioning but half-empty. Shops closed. Buildings evacuated. Population maybe two million from what must have been ten million at peak.

But still: life. People going to work. Children playing in parks. Community gardens maintained. Lagos is down to three million. Tokyo probably less. Everywhere: emptying. But not empty yet.

Not dead yet.

He visits the mayor's office where his mother works. The building is massive—designed for hundreds of staff. Now maybe thirty people maintain symbolic governance. Elena's office overlooks the ice shelf.

"What do you actually do?" Kenji asks, watching her review reports.

"Mostly theater," Elena admits. "Infrastructure maintenance schedules. Resource allocation. Emergency response protocols. But the systems are automated now. My job is mostly... presence. Being here. Witnessing. Making sure people know someone's still trying."

"That's not nothing."

"It's not much."

"It's what you can do. That's enough."

Elena looks at him with something like wonder. "When did you get so wise?"

"Professor Wei. She taught me the only wisdom there is: be present. Do what you can. Let go of the rest."

"I'm still learning to let go."

"Me too. But we have time to practice."

They work together sometimes—Kenji helping with administrative tasks, filing reports no one will read, maintaining order that's mostly symbolic. It feels absurd and necessary at the same time.

Like everything now.

Week two, Kenji visits Amara and David.

He finds them at the solar arrays—working together, his former mentor and her husband, both transformed from when he last saw them. They're connected now. Present. Alive in ways they weren't a year ago.

"Kenji!" Amara climbs down from the platform, pulls him into a hug. "You're back."

"I'm back."

"You look different."

"Everyone keeps saying that."

"Because it's true. You stopped seeking."

"How can you tell?"

"Your face is quiet. Your eyes are still. You're here, not somewhere else." She studies him with scientific precision. "What did you find?"

"Nothing. Everything. A teacher who died. Lessons about impermanence. Permission to stop running." He looks at David, who nods understanding. "You two look different too. Connected."

"We are," David says. "Finally. After ten years of hiding."

They have coffee on the platform—the three of them, talking about transformation. Amara tells him about closing the monitoring facility, reaching out to David, learning to be present instead of problem-solving.

"You inspired me," she says. "You left to seek. You came back having learned. I stayed and calculated. Both of us wasted time. But we're not wasting it now."

"No," Kenji agrees. "We're not."

He tells them about Wei. About the gardenia blooming and dying. About learning that meaning isn't in lasting but in being.

"She would have liked you," Kenji says to Amara. "You're both scientists of impermanence. You track the asteroid. She tracked the flower. Same truth, different scales."

"I'd like to have met her," Amara says.

"She's still teaching. Through memory. Through the people she touched." Kenji smiles. "That's its own kind of permanence. Not lasting, but real."

---

Week three, Kenji runs into Ibrahim.

Literally—turning a corner, colliding, both apologizing. Then recognition.

"Ibrahim?"

The fighter from Jerusalem. The certainty-seeker losing faith. But different now—older, limping, quieter. Wounded somehow. Changed somehow.

"Kenji." Ibrahim smiles—genuine, warm. "You came back."

"So did you, in a way."

They walk together—both limping metaphorically, Ibrahim limping physically. Through the orderly streets, past functioning systems, two seekers who stopped seeking.

Ibrahim tells him about the wound. The shrapnel. The medical evacuation against his will. The permanent limp, the ended fighting, the shattered faith.

"I lost everything," Ibrahim says. "God, purpose, identity. The wound took my fighting. But maybe it gave me something else."

"What?"

"Honesty. For the first time in my life, I'm honest. I don't know what matters. I don't know what comes next. I don't know how to live. But I'm here. I'm walking. I'm trying."

Kenji nods, recognizing the territory. "Professor Wei taught me the same thing. Not knowing is honest. Presence is enough."

"You met someone who understood?"

"Yes. And she died Year 12. Natural death. She was ready." Kenji's voice catches but he continues. "She taught me what you're learning. That certainty is illusion. That presence is truth. That being here matters more than knowing why."

They walk for an hour. Talk about transformation. Ibrahim shows him his refugee apartment—fourth floor, no elevator, the climb therapeutic and painful. Kenji tells him about Wei's garden, about the gardenia dying, about learning impermanence through beauty's briefness.

"I want to meet your mother," Ibrahim says. "She visited me in the hospital. She was kind. She didn't pretend to have answers."

"She'd like to see you too. She's good at presence. Always was. I just couldn't see it when I was younger."

"Maybe we only see it when we're ready," Ibrahim says.

"Maybe."

They part as friends—the seeker and the fighter, both transformed by journeys that broke them open, both present now, both honest.

Both home.

Month two in Antarctica, Kenji establishes routine.

Mornings with his mother—coffee, conversation, sometimes helping with governance work, sometimes just being together. She tells him about the last ten years. The population exodus. The infrastructure decay. The symbolic role she maintains.

"Why keep governing?" Kenji asks.

"Because someone has to. Because people need structure even when it's dying. Because witnessing matters—being here, bearing testimony, maintaining dignity until the end."

"That's enough?"

"I don't know. But it's what I can do."

Kenji understands. Everyone doing what they can. Amara maintaining arrays. David working with robots. Elena governing symbolically. Ibrahim learning to walk. Zara raising children. Everyone choosing what matters in the face of meaninglessness.

Everyone being present.

Afternoons, Kenji writes. Not for publication—who would publish it? Who would read it? Just: for clarity. For processing. For bearing witness to his own transformation.

He writes about Wei. About the gardenia. About learning to stop seeking. About returning home. About watching people he loves face extinction with grace.

He writes about his mother—how he judged her when younger for prioritizing power, how he sees now she was doing what she could, how presence is its own kind of power.

He writes about Amara and David—mentor and uncle-figure, two people who lost each other and found themselves again, teaching him that connection matters more than certainty.

He writes about Ibrahim—fighter losing faith, finding honesty instead, the wound that broke identity giving space for something new.

He writes about himself—the seeker who stopped seeking, the runner who came home, the son who learned to see his mother clearly.

Evenings, he meditates. Not religious practice—just: sitting, breathing, observing. Wei taught him this. The mind fills. That's what minds do. But between thoughts: space. Gaps. Moments of just breathing, just being, just here.

He's not enlightened. Still struggles. Still questions.

But gently now. Curiously. Not desperately seeking answers but exploring questions with kindness.

It's enough.

One evening, walking in the preserve with Elena, Kenji says, "I'm glad I came back."

"I'm glad too. So glad."

"I needed to leave. To seek. To try everything. To fail at everything. To meet Wei and learn that seeking was the problem."

"What did she teach you, really? In one sentence?"

Kenji thinks. "Be here. That's all. That's everything."

Elena stops walking. Looks at her son—thirty-two years old, transformed by journey, returned by choice, present by practice.

"I'm so proud of you," she says.

"For what? I ran away. I wasted seven years seeking impossible things."

"You had the courage to leave. The humility to learn. The wisdom to return. That's everything."

They walk until the preserve closes. Return to her apartment. Make dinner together—simple meal, easy rhythm. Mother and son, reconnected.

Kenji realizes: this is what he was seeking. Not enlightenment. Not faith. Not certainty. Just: connection. Presence. Home.

He found it by giving up the search.

That night, lying in the small guest room, Kenji thinks about the five years remaining. Five years to be present. Five years with his mother. Five years with the people he loves.

Not enough time.

But everything.

Always everything.

Outside, Antarctica functions. Inside, Kenji breathes. And in the space between breaths: peace.

Not perfect peace. Not permanent peace.

But present peace.

Here.

Now.

With people he loves.

Seeking stopped.

Being begun.

Home.

Finally.

Enough.

He falls asleep smiling.

For the first time in years—maybe ever—Kenji Torres is exactly where he needs to be.

Doing exactly nothing except being present.

And it's enough.

It's everything.

Five years.

Starting now.

Home.
