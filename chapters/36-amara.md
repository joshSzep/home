# Chapter 36: Amara

The day Zara arrives, Amara cannot stop crying.

She sees the transport ship dock. Sees her sister disembark with husband and children. Sees fifteen years of distance disappear in a moment.

They embrace on the frozen dock—sisters, finally, after everything—and Amara sobs. Relief. Regret. Love. All of it pouring out.

"I'm sorry," she says against Zara's shoulder. "I wasted so much time."

"You're here now," Zara says. "That's enough."

But is it? Fifteen years. Amara hid for ten. Worked for ten. Avoided her sister, her niece and nephew, her own life. For what? Fear? Protection? The illusion that isolation meant safety?

Now: three months left. Zara here. Maya and Kofi—seventeen and thirteen, nearly grown, about to die. Here because Amara finally, finally invited them.

Too late and just in time. Both true.

Amara pulls back. Looks at her sister. Zara's aged—fifty-three now, weathered by parenting and grief and choosing life despite doom. Beautiful. Brave. Everything Amara isn't.

"Thank you for coming," Amara whispers. "Thank you for forgiving me."

"Nothing to forgive. You're my sister. I love you. That's all that matters."

Behind Zara: Kwame. Steady, kind-faced, holding their belongings. And the children. Maya—tall, brilliant, mature beyond her years. Kofi—bright-eyed, curious, alive.

Amara's niece and nephew. Family she abandoned. Family she barely knows.

"Hi," Maya says softly. "Aunt Amara. I'm so glad we finally met."

Amara pulls her into a hug. Then Kofi. Then Kwame. Gathering them all. Her family. Finally here.

David stands beside her—quiet, supportive, present. He smiles at the children. Nods to Kwame. Witnesses the reunion with gentle dignity.

"Let's go home," Amara says. "It's freezing. Come inside."

Home. She has home now. Not just house. Home. Family. People she loves who love her back.

Three months left.

Three months to be sisters.

Three months to be aunt.

Three months to live instead of hiding.

Enough.

Has to be enough.

---

That first night, Amara can't stop watching them.

Maya and Kofi exploring the house. Touching everything. Asking questions. Being teenagers in ways they'll never finish.

Zara and Kwame exhausted from journey. But present. Attentive. Loving parents to the end.

David making tea. Preparing meal. Creating space for family to be family.

Amara sits on the couch, observing. The scientist in her: always observing. Always analyzing. Always documenting.

But now: not data. Just: love. Just: presence. Just: this moment mattering.

Maya sits beside her. "Aunt Amara? Mama says you study the asteroid. That you've tracked it for fifteen years."

"Yes. That's my work. Was my work. Still is, maybe. I'm not sure anymore."

"What's it like? Knowing exactly when you'll die?"

Direct question. Honest. Maya doesn't hedge. Zara taught her well.

"Terrible," Amara says honestly. "And clarifying. I've known for fifteen years. Down to the hour, eventually. Most people don't know. We do. That knowledge is... heavy."

"Does it help? Knowing?"

"Didn't for years. Made me hide. Made me calculate instead of living. But last five years—yes. Helped me wake up. Reconnect with David. Invite you here. Knowing forced me to choose presence."

"Professor Wei said knowing death makes life meaningful. That impermanence isn't tragedy—it's truth."

Amara nods. "Wei was wise. I never met her. But Kenji tells me about her. She understood what I'm still learning."

"What's that?"

"That being present matters more than solving problems. I spent ten years trying to solve the unsolvable. Five years learning to just... be. With David. With work. Now: with you."

Maya leans against her. Seventeen years old. Three months left. Brilliant and doomed and here.

"Thank you for inviting us," Maya says. "For letting us be here. With family. At the end."

"Thank you for coming. You didn't have to. You could have stayed in Lagos."

"No. We needed to be together. All of us. That's what matters."

They sit in comfortable silence. Aunt and niece. Scientist and student. Two people facing the end together.

Kofi runs past, chasing David's old cat. Laughter. Life. Present moment.

Amara watches him and feels overwhelming grief. He's thirteen. Should have decades. Has weeks.

But: he exists. Zara chose him. Against all advice, all logic, all fear. Chose life. Chose this boy running through her house bringing joy.

Defiant. Brave. True.

Amara hid. Zara lived. Who was braver?

The answer is obvious.

---

Next morning, Amara shows Maya the monitoring station.

Just the two of them. Aunt and niece. Scientist and inheritor of nothing.

The station is automated mostly. AIs tracking asteroid trajectory. Screens displaying data. Countdown precise: 87 days, 14 hours, 23 minutes.

"This is where I've worked for fifteen years," Amara says. "Watching. Calculating. Documenting."

"Why?" Maya asks. "If it can't be stopped?"

"Someone should witness. Someone should document. The asteroid ends humanity, but until then: we can say we watched. We understood. We didn't look away."

"Is that enough?"

"I thought it wasn't. For years, I thought witnessing without solving was failure. Now: I think witnessing is holy work. Being present. Paying attention. Saying: this happened and we saw it."

Maya studies the screens. Absorbs data. She's brilliant—inherited from both parents. Could have been great scientist. Won't have time.

"Can I see the asteroid?" Maya asks. "Visually? Through telescope?"

"Yes. Come."

Amara guides her to the observation deck. Ancient telescope, pre-automation. She calibrates coordinates. Focuses.

"There," she says. "Look."

Maya peers through eyepiece. Sees: distant point of light. Moving imperceptibly. Death approaching at forty kilometers per second.

"It's so small," Maya says.

"Fifteen kilometers wide. From here: just light. In three months: everything."

"How does it feel? To know you're looking at the thing that will kill you?"

Amara considers. "Used to feel terrible. Now: clarifying. I know my enemy. It's not malicious. Just: matter moving through space. Physics. Inevitable. Honest."

"Professor Wei said the universe isn't cruel. Just: indifferent. That cruelty requires intention. The asteroid has no intention."

"She was right. And that's somehow comforting. We're not being punished. Just: unlucky. Matter intersecting with matter. Brief collision. Then: silence."

They stand together on observation deck. Looking at death approaching. Aunt and niece. Both accepting. Both present.

"Thank you for showing me," Maya says. "For letting me see."

"You're a scientist. You should see. You should know. Knowledge is power, even when it can't change outcomes."

"Will you be here? At the end? Watching?"

"Yes. David will be with me. We'll witness from the solar array platform. Two hundred meters up. Clear view. Together."

"That's good. Witnessing together. That's everything."

They return inside. Data updating automatically. Countdown continuing. 87 days, 13 hours, 48 minutes.

Precise. Inevitable. True.

---

Days pass. Family settles into routine.

Amara shows them the megacity. Nature preserves—Kofi loves the penguins, last three survivors. Solar arrays—Maya helps David with maintenance, brilliant with engineering. Architecture—Zara appreciates human ambition, building forever from ice.

They have dinners together. Six people. Talking. Laughing. Grieving. Being family.

Amara learns her niece and nephew. Maya: thoughtful, philosophical, inherited Zara's warmth and Kwame's precision. Asks deep questions. Listens carefully. Will die at seventeen having understood more than most people at seventy.

Kofi: playful, curious, alive. Makes everyone laugh. Climbs on everything. Explores constantly. Will die at thirteen still being child. Tragic. Beautiful. True.

One evening, Kofi asks Amara: "Why did you stop calling Mama? After the asteroid was found?"

Direct. Honest. Children ask what adults won't.

"I was scared," Amara says. "I thought hiding would protect me. I was wrong."

"Did it hurt her? When you stopped?"

"Yes. Very much. I hurt your mother by disappearing. That's my biggest regret."

"But you invited us here. That fixed it."

"Some. Not all. But: we're together now. That's what matters."

"Do you love her?"

"So much. Always. Even when I was hiding. I love your mother more than anyone except David."

"She loves you too. She talks about you all the time. She missed you."

Amara's eyes water. "I missed her too. I'm so sorry I wasted time."

"You're here now. That's enough."

Children's wisdom. Simple. True. Enough.

Kofi hugs her. Thirteen years old. Three months left. Forgiving his aunt for failures because presence matters more than past.

Amara holds him. Her nephew. Her sister's defiant choice. Living proof that love persists despite doom.

"Thank you," she whispers. "For being here. For existing. For teaching me."

"You're welcome, Aunt Amara."

He runs off to play. Amara sits stunned. Taught by thirteen-year-old. Humbled by child.

Wei would approve.

Presence matters more than credentials.

Being matters more than knowing.

Love matters more than calculation.

Lessons Amara spent fifteen years learning. Kofi knows instinctively.

---

Week later, Amara and Zara sit alone.

Evening. Children in bed. Husbands giving sisters space. Tea and silence and fifteen years to process.

"Thank you," Amara says. "For bringing them. For coming. For forgiving me."

"Stop thanking me. You're my sister. I love you. That's all there is."

"I wasted so much time. Hid for ten years. I could have known Maya and Kofi. I could have supported you. I chose fear instead."

"You did what you needed to survive. I don't judge that."

"You should. I abandoned you when you needed me most. You had children facing doom. I hid in work. That's unforgivable."

"But I forgive you anyway. That's what love is."

Amara cries. Not first time. Not last. But: necessary. Releasing years of regret.

"They're extraordinary," Amara says. "Your children. Brilliant. Kind. Brave. You raised them so well."

"Thank you. They're my best work. My only work that mattered."

"How did you do it? Knowing they'd die young? How did you love them anyway?"

"Because the alternative was not loving. And that's worse than grief. Love is worth the pain. Always."

"I couldn't do it. I can barely love David. Adding children? I would have broken."

"You're stronger than you think. You survived fifteen years tracking our death. You reconnected with David. You invited us here. That's all strength."

"Doesn't feel like strength. Feels like finally waking up after decade of sleepwalking."

"Waking up is strength. Most people never do."

They sit in comfortable silence. Sisters who took different paths. Both arriving here. Both present now.

"Amara," Zara says softly. "Do you regret your life? Your choices?"

Amara considers. "Some. I regret hiding. I regret hurting you. I regret wasting time with David. But: I don't regret the work. Someone had to witness. Someone had to track. Someone had to document humanity's end. That someone was me. That mattered."

"It did matter. It does matter. You bore witness. That's holy work."

"Wei said that?"

"Yes. And she was right. What you've done—fifteen years of calculation, documentation, tracking—that's love. Different than my love, but love nonetheless. Love of knowledge. Love of truth. Love of witnessing."

Amara nods slowly. "I never thought of it that way. I thought I was hiding. But maybe: witnessing too. Both true."

"Both true. Always both."

They drink tea. Sisters to the end. Different loves. Same destination.

"I'm glad you're here," Amara says. "I'm so glad."

"Me too. Me too."

---

Month passes. Fifty-seven days left.

Amara still visits monitoring station. Not daily. Few times a week. Checking data. Updating records. Habit and meaning tangled together.

David comes with her sometimes. They work side by side—her tracking asteroid, him maintaining solar systems. Parallel witnesses. Different data. Same presence.

"Why do we still do this?" David asks one day. "The systems run themselves. The asteroid's trajectory is confirmed. Why keep working?"

"Because someone should," Amara says. "Because bearing witness matters. Because the work is real even if the outcome is fixed."

"Elena says the same thing. About governance. She still shows up even though there's nothing to govern."

"We're all bearing witness. You with arrays. Me with data. Elena with governance. Kenji with philosophy. Zara with parenting. Different forms. Same act. Saying: we were here. We saw. We documented. We mattered."

"Do we matter?"

"Has to. What else is there?"

David nods. Continues maintenance. Robot 47B works beside him—faithful, precise, unknowing. It will function until impact. Few seconds longer, maybe. Then: silence.

Amara watches them work. Husband and machine. Both persistent. Both present. Both mattering in moment.

She updates her final calculations. Trajectory confirmed. Impact site: Pacific Ocean. Angle: 23 degrees. Velocity: 40 kilometers per second. Energy: equivalent to ten billion Hiroshima bombs.

Numbers. Data. Truth.

Everyone dies. Everything ends. Complete extinction.

She saves the file. For whom? No one. Just: someone should document.

"David," she says. "Will you be with me? At the end? On the platform?"

"Yes. Already decided. We witness together."

"Thank you."

"Nothing to thank. You're my wife. I love you. Where else would I be?"

They work in silence. Fifty-seven days left. Systems functioning. Data updating. Presence continuing.

Enough.

---

Final weeks. Forty days. Thirty. Twenty.

Family time intensifies. Dinners longer. Conversations deeper. Silences comfortable.

Maya asks Amara about physics, astronomy, cosmology. Amara teaches her everything. Knowledge for its own sake. No future application. Just: understanding matters. Being curious matters. Learning until the end matters.

Kofi helps David on the platforms. Supervised. Careful. But: working. Maintaining systems that will die with them. Finding meaning in the work anyway.

Zara and Amara walk through preserves. Talking. Reminiscing. Healing fifteen years of distance in weeks.

Kwame and David bond quietly. Two steady men. Two people who loved difficult women through crisis. Two witnesses choosing presence.

They meet with Elena, Kenji, Ibrahim. Extended family. Community. All converging. All preparing. All facing it together.

One evening, Elena asks the group: "Will you regret anything? At the end?"

Silence. Everyone considering.

Ibrahim speaks first: "I regret fighting. Killing. Wasting years on certainty that was false. But: I don't regret learning uncertainty. That was necessary."

Kenji: "I regret seeking desperately instead of being present. But: Wei taught me. I learned. That's enough."

Elena: "I regret not being more present with my son when he was young. But: we're here now. Healed. That's everything."

David: "I regret the ten years Amara and I were distant. But: we reconnected. That's what matters."

Amara: "I regret hiding from my sister. From her children. From David. From life. I wasted ten years. But: I'm here now. Present. That has to be enough."

Zara: "I don't regret having my children. Everyone told me not to. I did anyway. Best choice I ever made. They're everything."

Maya: "I regret not existing longer. Not becoming who I might have been. But: I'm grateful I existed at all."

Kofi: "I don't regret anything. I'm with my family. I love everyone. That's enough."

Thirteen-year-old wisdom. Simple. Complete. True.

The adults sit humbled. Child teaching them acceptance.

"Kofi's right," Amara says. "Regret doesn't help. Presence does. We're together. We're loving. We're witnessing. That's everything."

They sit in circle. Nine people. Three generations. All facing it together.

Enough.

Always enough.

---

Ten days left.

Amara and David prepare the observation platform. Two hundred meters up. Solar arrays around them. Clear view of sky. Perfect place to witness.

They'll bring chairs. Tea. Blankets. Each other.

Zara's family will be nearby. In the preserve, probably. All together. Elena and Kenji too. Ibrahim. Everyone converging.

Different locations. Same moment. All witnesses.

"Are you ready?" David asks.

"No. But present. That's all I can be."

"That's enough."

"Is it? Really?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

Amara looks at her husband. Twenty-two years married. Ten years distant. Five years reconnected. Three months with family. Ten days left.

Not enough time. Never enough time.

But: real. Present. Mattering now.

"I love you," she says. "I'm sorry I disappeared. I'm grateful you waited. I'm grateful we're here together."

"I love you too. Always. To the end."

They stand on the platform. Wind whipping cold. Antarctica stretching forever. Sky clear. Asteroid approaching invisibly.

Ten days.

Then: together.

Amara takes David's hand. Her husband. Her witness. Her everything.

"Thank you," she whispers. "For staying. For waiting. For being here."

"Nowhere else I'd be."

They descend the platform. Return to family. Ten days of presence. Ten days of love. Ten days of being together.

Then: the asteroid.

Then: witness.

Then: silence.

But present now.

Loving now.

Together now.

Amara and David. Zara and Kwame. Maya and Kofi. Elena and Kenji. Ibrahim. All of them.

Family.

Finally.

Completely.

Ten days left.

Ten days to bloom.

Then: fade together.

But present now.

Always present now.

That's everything.

That's enough.

The flower bloomed.

Still blooming.

Wei was right.

Amara knows it now.

Learned it through hiding, through waking, through family, through love.

Being matters more than lasting.

Presence matters more than solving.

Love matters more than time.

Ten days.

Then together.

But present now.

Always present now.

Enough.

Forever enough.

Home.
