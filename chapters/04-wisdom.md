# Chapter 4 - Wisdom

The flowers needed watering.

Professor Mei-Lin Wei moved slowly through her small garden, cane in her left hand, watering can in her right. Each step deliberate. She was one hundred fourteen years old, and her body reminded her of this fact constantly. Knees that complained. Back that ached. Hands that shook slightly when she lifted things.

But the mind was still clear. That was what mattered.

The garden was small—just a balcony really, perhaps ten meters by ten, part of her apartment in Lagos District. But she'd filled it carefully over the decade since moving here from Beijing. Native flowers mostly, gene-designed for Antarctica's engineered climate. Some vegetables. A small lemon tree that gave fruit twice a year. Everything in its season, everything impermanent, everything returning to soil.

She was watering the gardenias when the alert came.

The house system chimed—emergency broadcast, priority override. Through her window she could hear other apartments doing the same, the whole building lighting up with alerts.

Wei set down the watering can carefully and walked inside. Pulled up the broadcast on her screen.

The words were simple. Almost absurdly so, given their weight.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact in 15 years. Deflection not possible.

She read it twice, making sure she understood correctly. Then she turned off the screen and walked back outside to finish watering.

The gardenias still needed water. The asteroid didn't change that.

She was checking the lemon tree—looking for signs of the scale insects that sometimes plagued it—when she heard running footsteps.

"Professor Wei!"

Zara burst through her door, her two-year-old daughter Maya on her hip. Zara's face was tear-streaked, her eyes wild with panic.

"Professor Wei, did you see? Did you see the broadcast?"

"Yes, dear. I saw."

"An asteroid! In fifteen years! Everyone's going to die!" Zara's voice rose toward hysteria. Maya started crying, picking up her mother's panic. "My daughter will die! She's two! She'll be seventeen! She'll never—she'll never—"

Zara collapsed onto Wei's garden bench, sobbing.

Wei set down her gardening tools and sat beside her. Not touching yet, just present. Letting Zara feel what she needed to feel. Sometimes grief had to move through you before wisdom could enter.

After a few minutes, the sobs quieted. Maya had calmed too, thumb in mouth, watching her mother with wide, confused eyes.

"How are you so calm?" Zara asked finally. "Doesn't this terrify you?"

Wei considered the question carefully. "I've been one hundred fourteen years old for three months. I've known I would die soon for the past decade. Now I learn that you'll die soon too. That everyone will. It's terrible for you, Zara. You're thirty-four. You should have had another lifetime. Maya should have had a full life. That's a real loss, and I'm sorry for it."

"But?"

"But death was always coming. For me, for you, for Maya. We just didn't know when. Now we do. That doesn't change what death is. Only when it arrives."

Zara stared at her. "That's it? That's your wisdom? We're all going to die anyway, so this doesn't matter?"

"No," Wei said gently. "This matters enormously. But not because it makes death real—death was always real. It matters because now everyone knows their time is short. And that changes how we live."

She gestured at the garden. The flowers bright in their pots. The lemon tree heavy with small green fruit. A butterfly landing on a gardenia bloom.

"These flowers will die this winter," Wei continued. "They always do. I plant them anyway. They're beautiful now. That's enough."

"Flowers aren't children."

"No. But the principle is the same. Temporary doesn't mean meaningless. It means precious."

Maya had climbed down from Zara's lap and was toddling toward the lemon tree. Wei watched her—small hands reaching up, delighted by a low-hanging fruit, pure wonder on her face.

"She's beautiful," Wei said quietly.

"She's going to die." Fresh tears came.

"Yes. And that's terrible. But she's beautiful now. Watch her. She's experiencing wonder right now, in this moment. The asteroid doesn't touch that."

Zara watched her daughter. Maya had found the butterfly, was laughing as it fluttered away from her reaching fingers. Two years old, innocent, alive in the perfect now.

"I don't know how to do this," Zara whispered. "How to live fifteen years knowing it ends. How to watch her grow up knowing she'll never be an adult. Never have children. Never—" Her voice broke.

Wei took her hand. The touch was light—her old fingers had little strength left. "You'll learn. Not today. But you'll learn. Humans are extraordinary at adaptation. At finding meaning even in impossible situations. You'll find a way."

"How did you learn? How are you so... so accepting?"

Wei smiled. "I'm one hundred fourteen years old, dear. I've been practicing for a very long time."

She stood slowly, using her cane for support, and walked to a small cabinet in her apartment. Returned with a worn book, pages yellowed with age. A collection of Buddhist teachings she'd been studying since her twenties.

"My teacher gave me this ninety years ago," Wei said. "After my husband died the first time—I married three times, lost all three. I was drowning in grief. Couldn't see the point of anything. My teacher sat with me and read me this passage." She opened to a marked page. "'Everything arises. Everything passes. Be present.'"

"That's it?" Zara asked.

"It sounds simple. It took me twenty years to really understand it. Everything that comes into being will cease to be. Mountains erode. Civilizations fall. Stars die. The asteroid is just making explicit what was always true—that everything ends."

"But people thought we had time. Forever Earth meant we'd have billions of years—"

"Forever was always an illusion," Wei said gently. "Heat death of the universe. Entropy. Everything ends, eventually. We just thought our 'eventually' was very far away. The asteroid moved it closer. That's terrifying. But it doesn't change the fundamental truth."

She looked at Maya, who was now investigating Wei's vegetable patch with fierce concentration.

"That child was always going to die," Wei continued. "Maybe at eighty. Maybe at one hundred fifty. Maybe tomorrow in an accident. We never know. We just pretend we do. Plan for futures that might not come. The asteroid takes away our pretending. Forces us to see clearly: time is short. This moment is what we have."

Zara was crying again, but quieter now. "What do I do with that? How do I live with it?"

"You love her. You're present with her. You let her be a child. You don't weigh her down with adult grief unless she asks. You water the flowers even though they'll die. You plant seeds even though you won't see them grow. You live anyway."

"Is that enough?"

"I don't know. But it's what love looks like when death is certain."

They sat together in the garden while the world processed its extinction. Maya playing with dirt and laughing at butterflies. Zara crying quietly, beginning the long work of acceptance. Wei holding space for both—the grief and the wonder, the terror and the beauty, the end and the now.

After a while, Zara spoke again. "Will you teach me? How to be present? How to... to bloom in autumn?"

Wei squeezed her hand. "Yes. Come back when you can. Bring Maya. The garden is always open."

###

Over the following weeks, people started coming to Wei.

First just neighbors—Zara most days, sometimes staying for hours while Maya played in the garden. Then friends of neighbors. Then strangers who'd heard there was an old philosopher who wasn't panicking, wasn't numbing herself, wasn't pretending it would be okay.

Wei didn't advertise. Didn't set hours. Just kept her door open and talked to whoever came.

A young man, mid-twenties, angry and lost: "What's the point? What's the fucking point of anything if we're all going to die?"

Wei: "You were always going to die. So was I. Everyone you love was going to die eventually. The asteroid just moved up the timeline. The point of life was never to live forever. It was to live."

"That's not good enough."

"I know. But it's what we have."

An old woman, eighty-three, bitter: "I made it this far. Survived disease, wars, outlived everyone I loved. I thought I'd earned a natural death. Peaceful. Now I die with everyone else in fire."

Wei: "Any death is natural. This is how the universe works—asteroids, entropy, extinction. It feels unfair because we thought we had more time. But time was never guaranteed."

"You don't understand."

"You're right. I don't understand your specific pain. But I understand loss. I've buried three husbands, two children, most of my friends. I'm still here. Still finding reasons to water flowers."

A mother with three children, youngest six: "How do I explain this to them? How do I help them live fifteen years knowing they'll never grow up?"

Wei: "The same way you'd help them live if they had a terminal illness. With love. With presence. Let them be children. Let them play. Don't weigh them down with adult grief unless they ask. They'll learn about death in their own time."

"Is that enough?"

"I don't know. But it's what love looks like."

She had no easy answers. No formulas. No five-step plans for accepting extinction. Just what she'd learned in one hundred fourteen years of living and ninety years of studying philosophy.

Impermanence is fundamental. Clinging causes suffering. Meaning is made, not found. Love anyway.

Some people left angry, wanting certainty she couldn't give. Some left comforted. Some left more confused than they arrived.

Wei didn't mind. She wasn't trying to fix anyone. Just bearing witness. Offering presence. Sharing what little wisdom she'd gathered.

###

Three months after the detection, Zara came to visit with news.

"I'm pregnant."

Wei looked up from the journal she was writing in. Zara stood in the garden doorway, hand on her belly, expression fierce and fragile at once.

"Deliberately?" Wei asked.

"Yes. Kwame thought I was crazy. But I want another child. Even though—even though they'll die young. Maybe especially because of that. I want to create life anyway." Her eyes filled with tears. "Is that insane?"

Wei set down her pen and gestured for Zara to sit.

"No. It's not insane. It's what life does."

"Everyone says I'm being selfish. Cruel. Bringing a child into a world that's ending. They say it's a death sentence."

"Life is always a death sentence," Wei said quietly. "We're born, we die. Your first child was always going to die. You didn't know when, but death was certain. This child will die in fifteen years instead of eighty. That's terrible. But it's not more terrible than any death. Just more visible."

Zara's tears spilled over. "I don't want to live fifteen years without creating something. Without hope. Even if the hope is temporary."

"All hope is temporary. That doesn't make it false."

"Everyone thinks I'm wrong."

"Maybe you are. I don't know. But I know that flowers bloom in autumn. That trees fruit before winter. That life creates life, even at the end. Maybe especially at the end." Wei reached over and took Zara's hand. "Do you want this child?"

"Yes. More than anything."

"Then have this child. Love them. Let them be your defiance against despair. Let them be proof that meaning exists even when everything ends."

Zara cried then—deep, wrenching sobs. But underneath the grief, Wei heard something else. Relief. Permission. Hope.

When she'd cried herself out, Zara looked at Wei with something like wonder. "How did you get so wise?"

Wei laughed—a dry, creaking sound. "By living one hundred fourteen years and paying attention. And reading many very smart dead people who thought about these questions. I didn't invent any of this, dear. I'm just old enough to have learned it."

"Will you be there? When the baby comes?"

"If I'm still alive, yes. I'll be there."

###

That evening, after Zara left, Wei sat in her garden and wrote in her journal.

She was writing a series of essays—reflections on impermanence, mortality, meaning-making in the face of extinction. Not for publication really. Just thinking on paper. Leaving thoughts behind in case anyone found them useful.

She wrote: *We thought Forever Earth meant we had endless time. Billions of years to solve problems, to grow, to become whatever we might become. The asteroid reveals what was always true: time is finite. Forever was always an illusion. Now we must learn what humans have always had to learn—how to make meaning in the face of death. How to love what we'll lose. How to bloom in autumn.*

Through her window, she could see Maya playing on the floor of Zara's apartment across the way. The child who would die at seventeen. Who was, in this moment, laughing at a toy.

Temporary and precious.

That was all anything ever was.

Wei looked at her garden. The flowers would die this winter. She'd plant new ones in spring. Would tend them through summer and fall. Would water them even in the final year, the final months, the final days before impact.

Would probably die before the asteroid arrived—she was one hundred fourteen. Fifteen more years would make her one hundred twenty-nine. Few people made it that far.

But if she did live that long, she'd still be watering these flowers. Still sitting in this garden. Still teaching whoever came to her door.

Still being present in whatever time remained.

That was all anyone could do.

Everything arises. Everything passes. Be present.

Wei set down her pen and looked up at the Antarctic sky. The asteroid was up there somewhere, falling toward them through the dark. Fifteen years away but coming with mathematical certainty.

She felt no fear. Just a quiet sadness for all the people who'd die young. For Maya and her unborn sibling. For Kenji Torres, that restless young man she'd heard about through students. For Zara and everyone else who had so much living left to do.

But no fear for herself.

She'd had one hundred fourteen years. She'd loved deeply and lost deeply and learned to be present anyway. She'd planted gardens knowing they were temporary. She'd taught students knowing she'd die before seeing what they became.

She'd been practicing for this her entire life.

The flowers still needed watering. Tomorrow she'd water them.

And the day after that.

And the day after that.

For as long as she had.

That was enough.
