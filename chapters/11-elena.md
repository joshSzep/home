# Chapter 11 - Elena

The morning briefing has five people in it.

Used to be thirty. Department heads, security chiefs, infrastructure coordinators, communications directors. The full apparatus of city governance.

Now it's Elena Torres, two remaining department heads, a security officer who looks like he hasn't slept in days, and her assistant Marcus, who's stayed for reasons Elena doesn't fully understand but is deeply grateful for.

The rest quit, fled, or died.

"Infrastructure report," Elena says, trying to maintain the ritual of governance.

The infrastructure coordinator—an exhausted woman named Chen—pulls up data. "Power grid functioning at 67% capacity. Water systems at 81%. Transport at 42% and dropping. We're losing maintenance crews daily. Some quit, some just stop showing up. Automation is holding most systems together, but when something breaks, we can't always fix it."

"Food distribution?"

"Adequate for now. Supplies coming from agricultural zones, though shipments are increasingly irregular. Global supply chains are fracturing. We have six months of reserves. Maybe eight if we ration."

"Security?"

The officer—young, maybe thirty, wearing a uniform that looks too big for him—shakes his head. "Crime is up 340% from last year. Response time increasing. Most officers abandoned posts. We're down to skeleton crews. Mostly just responding to the worst incidents. Property crime we're basically ignoring."

Elena nods. She expected this. Has been watching the slow collapse for eight months now.

"Birth rates?" she asks, though she knows the answer.

Marcus pulls up the data. "Seventeen births this month. Three hundred eighteen deaths. Twelve confirmed suicides. Population declining rapidly. Projections show we'll lose another 40% in the next year."

Eight months ago, Antarctica District had four million residents. Now it's down to three million. By next year, it might be two.

People are leaving, dying, giving up.

Elena can't blame them.

"Anything else?"

Silence. No one has anything to add. What's the point? They're all dying in fourteen years anyway.

"Thank you," Elena says. "Same time tomorrow."

They file out. Chen looks defeated. The security officer looks dead behind the eyes. Marcus lingers.

"Madam Mayor, the council is requesting a statement about the resource allocation changes."

"Which council? Half of them haven't attended in months."

"The ones who are left. They want to know if we're still maintaining the education systems."

Elena laughs—a bitter, exhausted sound. "Education? For what? So children can learn mathematics they'll never use? History that's about to end? We're educating them to die."

Marcus is quiet. Then: "Some parents are still asking for schools to stay open. They want their children to have... normalcy. Structure. Whatever time they have left."

Elena softens. "You're right. I'm sorry. Yes, keep the schools open as long as we can. Tell the council we're maintaining all essential services until we can't."

"What defines essential?"

"I don't know anymore. Anything that helps people live with dignity until the end. Schools, hospitals, food. The rest..." She waves her hand vaguely. "The rest is performance."

Marcus leaves. Elena sits alone in the council chamber, surrounded by empty seats.

She's been Mayor for twelve years. Fought for this position. Wanted to lead, to shape the future, to build something lasting.

Now she governs ruins.

Now there is no future.

Now everything she does is symbolic at best, futile at worst.

At home—the small apartment she's lived in since Hiroshi died—Elena finds a message from Kenji.

Her son, who dropped out of his PhD program eight months ago. Who spent months destroying himself at parties while she watched helplessly. Who finally told her he was leaving to travel, to search for meaning.

She'd let him go because what else could she do?

The message is audio, his voice:

*Mom, I'm in Lagos. I've been here three months. I found a teacher—an old philosopher named Professor Wei. She's helping me understand how to be present. How to live with impermanence. I'm not fixed, but I'm better. I'm awake. I wanted you to know.*

*How are you? How's the city?*

*I love you.*

Elena plays it three times.

Her son sounds different. Calmer. More grounded. Less desperate.

She's glad. Genuinely glad he found something.

But she also feels the absence. Kenji is gone. Hiroshi is dead. She leads a city that's collapsing. She goes home to an empty apartment every night.

She's so tired.

She should respond to Kenji. Should record a message, tell him she's proud, tell him to be safe.

Instead, she pours a glass of wine and sits on her balcony watching the megacity lights flicker. Some districts going dark. Others still bright. The whole city like a dying organism, systems shutting down one by one.

She thinks: I'm holding sand. The harder I squeeze, the faster it falls through my fingers.

She thinks: Why am I still doing this?

No answer comes.

She finishes the wine and goes to bed.

Tomorrow she'll show up at the office again. Tomorrow she'll try to govern an ungovernable collapse. Tomorrow she'll maintain the fiction that leadership matters.

Because what else is there?

---

Two weeks later, a riot breaks out in the southern district.

Started over food distribution—someone claimed the shipments were being hoarded, distributed unfairly. Probably not true, but truth doesn't matter when everyone's scared and angry.

Three hundred people in the streets. Looting. Breaking windows. Setting fires.

Elena calls security. "Send response teams."

The officer on duty—not the one from the morning briefing, someone else, equally exhausted—says, "We don't have response teams. Most units are at 30% capacity. The ones we do have are barely managing."

"Then send what we have."

"Mayor Torres, with respect—they're not going to risk their lives to stop a riot over food distribution. Not when we're all dying in fourteen years anyway. Not for the pay we can't even guarantee. Most of my people are saying: let them riot. What does it matter?"

Elena closes her eyes. "It matters because people are getting hurt. It matters because we don't have to descend into chaos just because the world is ending. It matters because—" She stops. Realizes she sounds desperate. "Please. Send who you can."

"I'll try."

He doesn't sound confident.

Elena grabs her security detail—two officers who still report for duty—and goes herself.

The southern district is chaos when she arrives. Smoke rising from buildings. People running. Glass shattered everywhere. Someone's overturned a transport vehicle.

Elena's security detail looks at her. "Madam Mayor, we should leave. We can't control this."

"I have to try."

She finds a raised platform—someone's abandoned market stall—and climbs onto it. Her security detail activates crowd-addressing amplification.

"Citizens!" Her voice carries across the chaos. "Please! Stop!"

Some people pause. Look at her. Most keep rioting.

"I know you're angry! I know you're scared! I know the world is ending and nothing makes sense anymore! But destroying our own city won't change that! We still have fourteen years! We still have to live together! Please!"

Someone in the crowd shouts: "You can't save us!"

"I know," Elena says. "I know I can't save you. I can't stop the asteroid. I can't give you a future. I can't fix this. But I can try to maintain some dignity! Some order! Some humanity until the end!"

Another voice: "Why? What's the point?"

"Because we're still alive! Because we don't have to spend our last years tearing each other apart! Because—" Her voice breaks. "Because it matters. Even if it doesn't change anything. It matters."

The crowd is quieter now. Listening. Or maybe just tired.

Slowly, people start to disperse. Not from agreement or conviction. Just: apathy. Exhaustion. The riot burns itself out like everything else.

Elena climbs down from the platform. Her hands are shaking.

Her security detail drives her back to the city center. She goes to her office. Sits in the dark.

Thinks: I have no power. I have no authority. I have nothing but the empty performance of governance.

Thinks: What am I doing?

---

Three months later, Elena receives a letter.

Physical paper—rare now, but some people still prefer it. The envelope is delicate, the handwriting elegant.

*Dear Mayor Torres,*

*My name is Professor Mei-Lin Wei. I am a philosopher living in Lagos. Your son Kenji has been studying with me these past months. He speaks of you often, with great love and respect.*

*I write because I sense you are struggling with questions of purpose and power. Your son mentioned that you continue to govern despite collapse. That you show up every day to a job that seems increasingly meaningless.*

*I want to tell you something I have learned in 116 years: You cannot hold chaos together. Civilizations fall. Systems collapse. Entropy is fundamental. This is not a failure of leadership. It is the nature of reality.*

*But you can witness it with dignity.*

*You can be present to the collapse without being destroyed by it. You can perform the rituals of governance not because they will succeed, but because performing them with integrity is itself meaningful. You can show up not because it changes anything, but because showing up is who you are.*

*This is not powerlessness. This is acceptance.*

*Power was always temporary. You are learning what comes after power.*

*Presence. Witness. Dignity.*

*My husband died ten years ago. I loved him deeply. His death did not unmake that love. The world ends in fourteen years. That does not unmake the life you have lived, the people you have served, the duty you have honored.*

*You are not failing, Mayor Torres. You are doing the hardest work: living with integrity when integrity seems pointless.*

*Keep showing up. Not because it saves anyone. But because it is who you are.*

*With respect,*  
*Professor Mei-Lin Wei*

Elena reads the letter three times.

Then she cries.

Not grief crying. Relief crying.

Someone understands. Someone sees what she's trying to do. Someone acknowledges that it matters, even when it doesn't matter.

She writes back immediately.

*Professor Wei,*

*Thank you. I needed to hear this. I've been questioning everything—why I continue, whether leadership means anything when there's nothing to lead toward, whether I'm just performing governance out of habit.*

*You're right. I can't hold it together. It's falling apart anyway. But I can witness it. I can show up with dignity.*

*Thank you for teaching my son. He sounds different now. Better. You've given him something I couldn't.*

*I hope to meet you someday.*

*Elena Torres*

Wei writes back.

They begin a correspondence that will last years. Letters about power and powerlessness. About meaning and meaninglessness. About showing up when showing up seems futile.

Wei becomes the wisdom Elena needs. The perspective she can't find in her own desperate city.

The letters keep her sane.

---

Six months after the riot, Elena sits in her office late at night.

The building is empty. Most staff gone home—or gone period. Just her, reading reports that barely matter.

Food supplies adequate. Infrastructure degrading. Population declining. Security minimal. Birth rates near zero.

The same reports every day. The city dying slowly, and Elena watching it happen.

Kenji calls.

His face appears on her screen, calling from Lagos. He looks good—healthier than when he left. Centered.

"Mom. How are you?"

"Tired. You?"

"Better. Learning a lot. Professor Wei is extraordinary."

"I've been corresponding with her. She's given me more wisdom in letters than I found in twelve years of governance."

Kenji smiles. "She has a gift for that. Clarity. Perspective."

"How much longer will you stay there?"

"I don't know. A while longer. I'm not done learning yet. But I'll come home eventually. I want us to have time together before—" He stops.

"Before we die," Elena finishes.

"Yeah."

They're quiet for a moment. Then Elena says, "I'm glad you left. I was scared when you told me. But I'm glad. You found something. You're alive in a way you weren't before."

"I was drowning. Now I'm swimming. Still in deep water. But swimming."

"Me too. I was trying to control the uncontrollable. Now I'm just... present. Showing up. Bearing witness. It's easier."

"Professor Wei said something to me," Kenji says. "She said: 'The asteroid didn't make life meaningless. It made the pre-existing meaninglessness visible. Now you can stop pretending and start choosing.' That helped me."

Elena thinks about it. "She's right. I spent twelve years pretending leadership mattered because it built toward some lasting future. Now I lead because leading with integrity is intrinsically valuable. Not because it changes anything. Just because it's who I am."

"That's wisdom, Mom."

"No. That's exhaustion. But I'll take it."

They talk for another hour. About Lagos. About Antarctica. About the people they're meeting and losing. About how to spend fourteen years.

When the call ends, Elena feels less alone.

She's still governing ruins. Still showing up to maintain a system that's collapsing.

But she's not drowning anymore.

She's bearing witness.

And somehow, that's enough.

---

One year after the detection, Elena Torres sits in the Mayor's office at 2am.

Outside, the megacity flickers. Some parts alive. Some parts dying. All of it temporary.

She pulls up her official calendar. Tomorrow: morning briefing, resource allocation meeting, citizen complaint session, infrastructure review.

All of it symbolic. All of it futile.

All of it what she'll do anyway.

Because showing up matters. Not because it changes outcomes. But because showing up with dignity is itself meaningful.

Because she's not a leader anymore—not really. She's a witness.

Bearing testimony to the end of everything.

And that's enough.

That has to be enough.

She closes the calendar. Updates her correspondence with Professor Wei. Writes a message to Kenji.

Then she goes home.

Tomorrow she'll show up again. Govern a city that can't be governed. Lead people who don't need leading, who are dying anyway, who've lost faith in everything including her.

She'll show up because it's who she is.

Even when it doesn't matter.

Especially then.

Fourteen years left.

Then thirteen years, eleven months.

Then thirteen years, ten months.

The countdown continues.

Elena continues with it.

Bearing witness to the end.
