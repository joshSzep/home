# Chapter 33: Ibrahim

Year 10. Ibrahim Al-Rashid, former fighter, climbs the stairs to his fourth-floor apartment in the refugee housing complex.

Fifty-three steps. He counts them. Every day for two years, counting. Therapeutic, the doctors said. Rebuilding strength after the wound. But Ibrahim thinks it's something else. Not therapy. Penance. Or maybe just: attention.

Wei's teaching, filtered through Kenji: pay attention. Be present. Count the steps.

His leg aches. Always will. Piece of shrapnel still lodged near the spine—too dangerous to remove. So: permanent limp. Permanent reminder. You fought for holy ground that won't last. You killed for meaning that wasn't there.

He reaches the fourth floor. Breathes. Continues.

Five years until the asteroid. Twenty-nine years old. Faith gone. Fighting gone. Identity gone.

Building something new. Slowly. One step at a time.

---

Morning routine: wash, dress, eat. Simple.

No prayer. Can't anymore. He tried, those first months in Antarctica. Went through motions—ritual washing, prostration, words memorized since childhood. But: nothing. Just: body moving. No connection. No presence. No God listening.

Or maybe: no God at all.

That thought used to terrify him. Now it just... is.

He makes tea. Sits at his small table. Looks out the window at McMurdo District. Orderly streets, failing infrastructure, two thousand people maintaining civilization for five more years.

Why? Wei would ask. Why maintain it?

And Ibrahim would answer: because we're here. Because it matters now even if it doesn't matter later.

He's learned this. From Kenji. From Elena. From just: being here. Being present. Being uncertain.

Today he has work. Maintenance job at the community center. Fixing pipes, replacing wiring, keeping systems running that will stop in five years anyway.

Meaningless and meaningful. Both true at once.

He finishes his tea. Climbs down the fifty-three steps. Counts them.

Present. Uncertain. Alive.

---

The community center is half-empty when Ibrahim arrives.

Used to be full. Year 1, Year 2—packed with people trying to find meaning, connection, purpose. Now: few dozen regulars. Everyone else stopped looking. Or found it. Or gave up.

Ibrahim doesn't judge anymore. He did everything—looked desperately, found briefly, lost completely. Now: just being.

He works on pipes in the basement. Old systems, pre-Forever Earth. Meant to last centuries. Will last five more years. Maybe.

Dr. Okafor, the therapist who helped him learn to walk again, stops by mid-morning.

"Ibrahim," she says warmly. "How's the leg?"

"Same. Aches. Works. I'm grateful."

"And the rest?"

She means: the faith, the identity, the purpose. The things that shattered when the missile hit.

"Also same. Gone but not missed. Does that make sense?"

"Perfect sense. Grief isn't always longing. Sometimes it's just: absence you've accepted."

He nods. Continues working. She watches for a moment, then: "I hear you've been attending services. Multiple traditions."

"Yes. Muslim Friday prayers, Christian Sunday mass, Jewish Shabbat, Buddhist meditation, Humanist gatherings. Rotating."

"Why?"

"Not to believe. I don't. But: to understand. I believed for twenty-seven years. Then stopped. But the believing was real. I want to understand what I lost. What others still have."

"And?"

"They're all true. And all incomplete. And all... attempts. Humans trying to make meaning. God or no God, that attempt is real."

Dr. Okafor smiles. "Professor Wei would have liked you."

"Kenji tells me about her. I wish I'd met her. She understood impermanence. She could have helped me when I was desperate."

"You're helping yourself now. That's everything."

She leaves. Ibrahim continues working. Pipes repaired. System functioning. Five more years of hot water.

Enough.

Friday afternoon, Ibrahim goes to the mosque.

Small building in the residential district. Converted storage facility. Fifty people praying—down from two hundred Year 1. But: committed. Still faithful despite asteroid. Still believing.

Ibrahim removes his shoes. Enters. Sits in back.

Imam Al-Mazari leads prayer. Old man, refugee from Syria, led prayers in Damascus before it drowned. Now: leads fifty faithful in Antarctica.

The prayers begin. Arabic flowing like water. Ibrahim knows every word. Recited them ten thousand times. Can't recite them anymore.

But he listens. And remembers what it felt like. The certainty. The connection. The sense of something larger than self.

Was it real? He doesn't know. Does it matter? Also doesn't know.

The faithful prostrate. Ibrahim stays seated. Observer, not participant. Witness, not believer.

After prayers, few people linger. Talking quietly. Community more than doctrine now. Everyone knows the asteroid's coming. Faith is comfort, connection, continuation of identity. Not salvation. Can't be. Not anymore.

Young man approaches Ibrahim. Name's Rashid—same as Ibrahim's surname. Coincidence, probably. Or: inevitable. Common name.

"You come often," Rashid says. "But you don't pray."

"No."

"Why not?"

"I can't anymore. I don't believe."

"But you come anyway?"

"I'm trying to understand what I lost. What you have. Why you keep it."

Rashid sits beside him. He's maybe twenty-two. Grew up after detection. Knows only this world.

"I keep it because my parents kept it," Rashid says. "Because it connects me to them, to ancestors, to tradition. Not because I think paradise waits. I don't know what waits. Maybe nothing. But the prayers make me feel connected. To something. To people. To history."

"Does that work? Without paradise?"

"Mostly. Some days it feels hollow. Other days it feels true. Both are okay."

Ibrahim nods. "Thank you. For telling me honestly."

"Thank you for coming. For witnessing. Even if you don't believe."

They sit in comfortable silence. Former fighter and young believer. Both facing the asteroid. Both finding their own way.

---

Saturday, Ibrahim attends Shabbat.

Jewish community's even smaller—thirty people in makeshift synagogue. Rabbi Cohen leads. She's younger than Ibrahim, brilliant, trained on Earth before coming to Antarctica Year 5.

The service is mostly Hebrew. Ibrahim doesn't understand. Just: listens. Observes. Feels.

Afterward, Rabbi Cohen approaches.

"Ibrahim," she says. "You've been coming for months. What draws you?"

"Curiosity. Grief. Understanding."

"You're Muslim?"

"Was. Lost faith Year 9. Now I'm... uncertain."

"Uncertainty is Jewish tradition," she says with a smile. "We argue with God constantly. Even when we believe."

"Can you argue with something you're not sure exists?"

"Better to argue with uncertainty than bow to false certainty."

Ibrahim considers this. "I spent my life certain. Fought for certainty. Killed for certainty. Now: nothing is certain. It's terrifying."

"Of course it is. But maybe: honest?"

"Very honest. Painfully honest."

Rabbi Cohen nods. "Come to study group sometime. Tuesday evenings. We argue Torah, Talmud, philosophy. You don't need to believe. Just: think. Question. Engage."

"I might. Thank you."

"The asteroid's coming whether we believe or not. Might as well spend the time thinking deeply."

She returns to her congregation. Ibrahim leaves. Walking slowly, fifty-three steps eventually, thinking.

Uncertainty is honest.

Wei taught that. Kenji teaches that. Now Rabbi Cohen teaches that.

Maybe he's learning.

Sunday, Ibrahim visits Kenji.

The Seeker Who Stopped Seeking lives simply. Small apartment, minimal possessions, daily meditation practice. Ibrahim knocks. Kenji answers, smiling.

"Ibrahim. Come in. Tea?"

"Always."

They sit. Kenji makes tea ceremonially—Wei taught him. Attention to detail. Presence in small actions. Making tea like it matters.

Because it does. Because everything matters or nothing does. Both true.

"Went to mosque Friday," Ibrahim says. "Synagogue yesterday. Christian service this morning."

"What are you learning?"

"That everyone's trying. That no one has answers. That the trying is what matters, maybe."

Kenji nods. "Wei would say: trying implies goal. Better to just: be present. No goal. No achievement. Just: here."

"How do you do that? Be present without purpose?"

"Practice. Meditation. Attention. Failing constantly. Trying again—sorry, being again."

Ibrahim laughs. "You correct yourself a lot."

"Language is built for achieving. Hard to talk about being. Wei struggled with it too. Finally gave up explaining. Just: showed us. Through living."

"I wish I'd met her."

"You would have liked each other. Both of you lost the thing you built your life on. Both of you finding new way."

Ibrahim sips tea. Looks at Kenji. "You're different since you came back. Calmer. Clearer."

"I stopped seeking. Wei taught me. I spent seven years desperate for answers. She taught me: the desperation was the problem. Not the lack of answers. The need for them."

"And now?"

"Now I'm here. With you. Drinking tea. In five years, I'm dead. That's certain. But right now: tea is hot, your company is good, the moment is real. That's enough."

"Is it? Really?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

Ibrahim doesn't answer. Drinks tea. Sits with his friend. Counts breaths like Kenji taught him. Fifty-three breaths. Fifty-three steps. Fifty-three anything. Numbers are arbitrary. Presence is real.

Maybe that's enough.

Trying to believe it.

Year 11. Ibrahim's journal, page 47:

*Don't know who I'm writing to. Habit, maybe. Or: way of organizing thoughts.*

*Used to pray. Same function. Talking to God (or myself pretending God listened). Now: journal. Talking to myself, no pretense.*

*Not sure which is more honest.*

*Saw Kenji today. He's grieving Professor Wei. She died last month. Natural death. He can't stop crying. But he also: meditates. Sits with grief. Doesn't run from it.*

*He said: "She taught me that missing someone is proof you loved them. Grief is love persisting after loss. So I grieve. Fully."*

*Makes sense. When I lost faith, I grieved. Still do sometimes. That was love too. Loving certainty. Loving connection. Loving God.*

*Now: love without object. Or: love of being here. Love of uncertainty.*

*Strange kind of love. But real.*

*Five years left. Maybe I spend them learning to love this way. Without purpose. Without reward. Just: loving being here.*

*Wei would say yes. Kenji would say yes. Rabbi Cohen would argue. Imam Al-Mazari would pray for me.*

*All of them: valid. All of them: incomplete.*

*I contain all of them. Fighter, believer, doubter, seeker, witness.*

*All of it. None of it.*

*Just: Ibrahim. Uncertain. Present. Alive.*

*For five more years.*

*Then—*

*But not yet.*

*Present now.*

*That's enough.*

Year 12. Winter in Antarctica. Dark months.

Ibrahim works less—jobs are scarce. Systems failing. Society contracting. But: small community persists. Meals together. Conversations. Connection.

Elena Torres, the mayor, still maintains symbolic government. Ibrahim sees her sometimes. She's dignified, present, clear. Governing nothing but doing it with grace.

He respects this. Duty without purpose. Being without achieving.

Kenji's with her often now. Mother and son, reunited, making up for lost years. Ibrahim watches them and feels... not envy exactly. More like: recognition. Love persisting. Mattering now.

One evening, Elena invites Ibrahim to dinner.

Small gathering. Her, Kenji, Amara and David (the scientists who reconnected), few others. Simple meal. Good conversation.

"Ibrahim," Elena says. "Kenji tells me you attend every religious service in McMurdo."

"Most of them. Trying to understand."

"Have you?"

"Some. I understand why people believe. Why they need to. Why they don't. All of it makes sense. None of it is complete."

"And you? Where do you land?"

Ibrahim considers. "Nowhere. I'm uncertain. Permanently. And I think: that's okay. Uncertainty is honest. Maybe the only honest response to existence."

Amara leans forward. "That's Wei's teaching. Kenji's been spreading it."

"It's good teaching," Ibrahim says. "I fought for certainty. Killed for it. Now: learning to live without it. Hard but necessary."

"Three years left," David says. "Does uncertainty comfort you? Facing the end?"

"Not comfort. But: truth. I spent my life believing paradise waited. Now I don't know. Maybe nothing. Maybe something. Probably nothing. But I'm okay not knowing. This moment—sitting here with you—is real. That's enough."

Kenji smiles. "Wei would be proud."

"I'm proud of me too. For the first time. I survived losing everything. Still here."

They eat together. Talk. Laugh sometimes. Grieve sometimes. Face what's coming together.

Community without doctrine. Connection without certainty. Being without purpose.

Enough.

Has to be.

---

One night, alone in his apartment, Ibrahim tries to pray.

Not because he believes. Because: habit. Muscle memory. Identity calling from the past.

He washes. Faces Mecca (or where Mecca was—the holy lands are underwater now). Begins.

*Allahu Akbar.*

God is greatest.

But: does he believe it? No.

He stops. Sits back. Breathes.

The prayer was for him, not God. Way of organizing thoughts. Way of feeling connected. Way of being Ibrahim Al-Rashid, Faithful Fighter.

But he's not that anymore. That Ibrahim died in Year 9, shrapnel through the hip, faith bleeding out.

This Ibrahim—uncertain, present, building new identity—doesn't pray.

This Ibrahim just: sits. Breathes. Exists. Without destination. Without purpose. Without God.

Terrifying.

Liberating.

Both.

He sits in the dark. Antarctica howling outside. Three years stretching ahead. Then: nothing. Or something. Or unknowable.

Uncertainty.

Honest.

Enough.

He writes in his journal:

*I can't pray anymore. Tried tonight. Failed. Or succeeded—depending on perspective.*

*The praying was habit. The stopping is truth.*

*Three years left. I'll spend them uncertain. Present. Witnessing. Being.*

*No paradise. No purpose. No God.*

*Just: this moment. This breath. This life.*

*Wei was right. Kenji's right. Rabbi Cohen's right.*

*Uncertainty is honest.*

*And honesty is enough.*

*Has to be.*

*For three more years.*

*Then—*

*But present now.*

*Always present now.*

*Ibrahim Al-Rashid. Fighter. Believer. Doubter. Seeker. Witness.*

*Human.*

*Uncertain.*

*Alive.*

*Enough.*

He closes the journal. Sits in silence. Counts fifty-three breaths.

Outside, Antarctica endures. Inside, Ibrahim endures. Faithless but not hopeless. Purposeless but not empty. Uncertain but not lost.

Just: here.

For three more years.

Then: together with everyone. Kenji. Elena. Amara. David. Zara's family when they arrive. The faithful and the doubters. The certain and the uncertain.

All facing it together.

That's everything.

That's enough.

Wei knew it.

Now Ibrahim knows it too.

Three years left.

Three years to be present.

Three years to witness clearly.

Three years to live without certainty.

Then—

But not yet.

Present now.

Uncertain now.

Alive now.

Enough.

Always enough.

The honest truth.

The only truth.

Enough.
