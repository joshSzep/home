# Chapter 4 - David

The alert came through on the platform radio at 3:52 AM.

David Chen was two hundred meters up, doing routine maintenance on Solar Array 7-Delta. The work was methodical, familiar: check connection integrity, clean dust from panels, verify power output. He'd done it a thousand times. He did it in the dark before dawn because the arrays worked better in sunlight and he preferred not to interrupt their function.

He was alone up here. Preferred that too.

The radio crackled—AI emergency broadcast, priority override. David paused, wrench in hand, and listened.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact probability 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. Deflection not possible.

He stood on the platform, two hundred meters above Antarctica, and looked at the sky. Dawn was starting to break—pale light washing over the solar arrays that stretched in every direction, thousands of panels catching the first rays of sun to power the city of four billion below.

In fifteen years, all of this would be gone.

These panels he was maintaining. The city they powered. The four billion people sleeping in their beds. Amara, sleeping alone in theirs because he'd left before she woke. All of it: gone.

He couldn't see the asteroid. It was too far, too small, lost in the vastness of space. But it was there. Coming at them at impossible speed, following the immutable laws of orbital mechanics that Amara had tried to explain to him once. He hadn't understood the math. He understood outcomes. And the outcome was certain.

David stood there for a long time, holding his wrench, watching the sun rise.

Then he finished replacing the connection he'd been working on.

Habit. Training. The panel needed maintenance regardless of whether humanity had fifteen years or fifteen thousand. He tightened the bolts with careful precision, verified the connection, logged it in his maintenance report.

Then he climbed down.

The platform elevator descended slowly, two hundred meters taking three minutes. David watched the city wake up around him. Lights coming on in residential towers. The night shift ending at the hydroponic farms. Transport pods beginning their morning routes.

All of it would continue for fifteen years. And then stop.

His comm lit up with messages—dozens of them. The news was spreading. People reaching out, panicking, seeking connection. He ignored them all and headed home.

---

Amara wasn't there.

Of course she wasn't. She'd be at the monitoring station, dealing with the crisis. She'd probably been the one to detect it—that was her job, watching the sky for threats. She'd found one that couldn't be stopped.

David stood in their apartment, listening to the silence.

They'd lived here for thirteen years. It was a good apartment by Antarctica standards—two bedrooms they didn't use, a kitchen Amara barely cooked in, a living space where they occasionally crossed paths. Comfortable. Distant. The apartment of two people who were married but not quite together anymore.

He'd let that happen. Let her drift into her work, let himself drift into his. It had been easier than confronting the slow dissolution of what they'd once had. Marriage was maintenance too, he'd thought. Sometimes systems degraded. You did what you could and accepted the rest.

Now they had fifteen years left, and he'd wasted how many already?

David's comm chimed. Amara.

He accepted the call. She looked exhausted—still at the station, surrounded by screens and data. Her face was drawn, her eyes shadowed.

"I saw the alert," he said.

"I'm the one who detected it." Her voice was flat. "I've been here since three AM. Running calculations, trying to find a way to stop it. There isn't one."

"Are you coming home?"

"I need to stay. The director is coming in. There are going to be meetings, briefings. We need to—" She stopped, seemed to realize the futility. "I need to be here."

David nodded. Of course she did. When had she not needed to be somewhere else?

"Okay," he said. "I'll be here when you get back."

"David—"

He waited. She looked like she wanted to say something important. Instead:

"Nothing. I'll see you later."

The call ended.

David stood in the empty apartment and thought about fifteen years. 5,475 days. 131,400 hours. All of it finite now, countable, diminishing.

He should feel something. Panic, maybe. Grief. Terror. Instead, he felt numb.

Outside, he could hear the city waking to the news. Voices in the hallway, some raised in disbelief. Someone crying. Someone else shouting. The ambient sound of a world fracturing.

David went to the kitchen and made tea. It was what Amara drank when she was stressed, though she rarely let him make it for her. He made it anyway, the way she liked it—strong, no sugar. Left it on the counter where she'd find it when she came home.

If she came home.

He stood at the window looking out at the solar arrays. The sun was fully up now, the panels soaking in light, converting it to power with perfect efficiency. They'd continue doing that until the moment of impact. The automated systems didn't care about extinction. They'd fulfill their function right up until they were vaporized.

There was something peaceful about that.

---

Days passed.

Amara didn't come home that first day. Or the second. She was consumed by the crisis—meetings with the UN, briefings with the council, desperate attempts to find solutions that didn't exist. When she finally came home on the third day, she looked like a ghost.

"I'm sorry," she said, standing in the doorway like she didn't quite remember how to enter her own apartment. "I couldn't—there was so much—"

"It's okay," David said.

"It's not okay." She walked past him into the living room and sank onto the couch. "Nothing's okay. We're all going to die and I can't fix it and I keep running the same calculations hoping for different results but physics doesn't care what I hope—"

David sat beside her. Not too close. They hadn't been close in a long time.

"You can't fix this," he said quietly.

"I know." Her voice broke. "I know that. But I keep trying anyway because what else am I supposed to do?"

She started crying—really crying, not the controlled composure she usually maintained. David pulled her toward him and she came, collapsing against his shoulder in a way she hadn't done in years.

They sat like that for a long time. Not talking. Just holding each other while the world ended around them.

When she finally pulled away, her eyes were red but clearer.

"I found your tea," she said. "On the counter. That first morning."

"I thought you might need it."

"I did." She looked at him—really looked at him, maybe for the first time in months. "Thank you."

"You're welcome."

She left again the next day. Back to the station, back to the futile calculations. He went back to work too. The solar arrays still needed maintenance. The city still needed power. For fifteen years at least.

His supervisor called a meeting of the entire maintenance division. Half the staff didn't show up. Some had quit. Some had killed themselves. Some had just stopped coming.

"We need to maintain operations," the supervisor said, though he looked like he didn't believe it himself. "The city still needs power. People still need—"

"For what?" someone interrupted. "Why maintain anything? We're all going to die."

Silence. No one had an answer to that.

David thought about the solar panels, two hundred meters up, converting sunlight to electricity with perfect mechanical precision. They didn't need a reason. They just functioned.

"I'll keep working," he heard himself say.

The supervisor looked at him gratefully. "Thank you, Chen."

After the meeting, another engineer cornered him. "Why? What's the point?"

David shrugged. "What else am I going to do?"

It wasn't an answer. But it was true.

---

Three months later, David stood on Platform 7-Delta again, replacing the same connection he'd replaced on detection day.

The panels degraded on a predictable schedule. Three months was the interval for this particular junction. It would need replacing again in another three months, and then another, and then another, for fifteen years until there was no one left to replace it.

He could just let it fail. The panel would lose efficiency, eventually stop working. The city would have slightly less power. In the grand scheme of extinction, it didn't matter.

But he replaced it anyway.

Below, Antarctica was fracturing. The news showed riots in some districts, mass suicides in others. The birth centers had emptied out—who wanted to bring children into a dying world? Economies were collapsing. People abandoning jobs, relationships, responsibilities. Why maintain anything that would end?

David tightened the bolt with careful precision and logged the repair.

At home, Amara was disappearing into her work. She came back less and less. When she did come home, she was hollow—going through motions, barely speaking. They were living in the same apartment but might as well have been on different continents.

He should say something. Should reach out. Should try to reconnect.

Instead, he went to work. Climbed the platforms. Maintained the arrays. Watched the automated systems continue their eternal function.

One day, standing at the edge of Platform 7-Delta, he thought: *I could jump.*

It would be easy. Just step off. Two hundred meters was enough. It would be faster than waiting fifteen years. Painless, or at least quick.

He stood at the edge and looked down at the city spread below him. Thought about Amara, somewhere down there, drowning in calculations that led nowhere. Thought about the fifteen years he'd waste waiting for the asteroid if he stayed.

Then thought: *What's the difference?*

Jump now, die in fifteen years. The endpoint was the same. The interval was just timing.

He stepped back from the edge.

Not from hope. Not from any particular attachment to living. Just from... inertia. Momentum. The same force that kept him climbing the platforms, maintaining the panels, going through the motions.

He finished his maintenance shift and climbed down.

The city was quieter now. Fewer people out. Fewer lights on at night. The slow contraction of a civilization that knew it was ending.

David went home to the empty apartment and made tea he wouldn't drink. Waited for Amara who might not come home. Thought about fifteen years of this—functional but not living, maintaining systems that would end anyway, married to someone he barely spoke to anymore.

In the morning, he'd go back to work. Climb the platforms. Replace connections. Watch the sun rise over arrays that would function until they were vaporized.

It wasn't meaningful. It wasn't hopeful. It wasn't even particularly sad.

It just was.

And somehow, that was enough to keep going.

For now.

Six months after detection, David's maintenance division was down to a skeleton crew. Of the thirty engineers who'd been working when the asteroid was detected, only seven remained. The rest had quit, fled, or died.

The automated systems were picking up more of the load. Robots could do 60% of the maintenance work. The remaining humans covered the rest.

David found he preferred working with the robots. They didn't ask existential questions. Didn't need reassurance. Just executed their maintenance protocols with perfect reliability.

One day, working alongside Maintenance Unit 7-B, he said out loud: "You're right. It doesn't need a reason."

The robot continued adjusting a panel mounting, unconcerned with philosophy.

David finished his own task and looked out at the solar arrays stretching to the horizon. Thousands of panels, all functioning. All maintained by humans and robots working in quiet coordination. All doomed.

The robot completed its task and moved to the next panel.

David followed.

That night, he came home to find Amara sitting in the dark living room. Not working. Not moving. Just sitting.

"Are you okay?" he asked.

"No."

He sat down in the chair across from her. They didn't touch. Didn't move closer. Just occupied the same space, two people in a dying marriage in a dying world.

"Me neither," he said.

It wasn't comfort. It wasn't connection. But it was honest.

Amara nodded in the darkness.

Outside, the city hummed with the power from arrays he'd helped maintain. The solar panels kept functioning. The automated systems kept running. The infrastructure of civilization persisted through momentum and habit.

David understood that. He was the same way.

He got up and went to bed. Amara stayed in the living room.

Somewhere above them, invisible in the night sky, an asteroid continued its approach. Fifteen years became fourteen and a half. The countdown ticked on with mathematical precision.

And David Chen, senior infrastructure engineer, decided he'd show up to work tomorrow. Not because it mattered. Not because he'd found meaning.

Just because it was what he did.

The panels would need maintenance again in three months.

He'd be there to replace them.
