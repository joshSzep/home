# Chapter 21: Drift

**POV: Ibrahim al-Rashid | Year 6, Month 11 | Antarctica**

---

The prayer beads sat on Ibrahim's palm. Ninety-nine beads—dark wood worn smooth by years of handling. He moved through them automatically, fingers finding each bead, but his lips stayed silent. No names. No prayers. Just the motion.

*Ar-Rahman. Ar-Rahim. Al-Malik.*

He used to say them. Used to mean them. The Compassionate. The Merciful. The King. Now they were just beads. Smooth wooden spheres on a string. Weight without meaning.

Ibrahim set them on the windowsill and stood, slowly. His left leg protested—always did, always would. The shrapnel was still there, too close to his spine for removal. Permanent souvenir from his last battle. Four years ago now. Four years since everything broke.

Twenty-three years old. Nine years left. No faith. No purpose. No identity.

Just: alive.

The apartment was small—bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette. Standard refugee housing. Building 12, Unit 403. Fourth floor. He knew the exact number of steps to get here. Counted them every day.

Fifty-three steps.

He'd counted them his first day and kept counting. Didn't know why. Just did. Now it was habit. Ritual without religion. Practice without belief.

Ibrahim pulled on his jacket—Antarctic winter approaching, even the megacity's climate control couldn't fully compensate. His cane leaned against the wall. Twenty-three and using a cane. Fighter-turned-refugee-turned-broken-man.

He opened the door and began his daily walk.

One step. Left leg strong, right leg compensating, cane supporting. Two steps. The corridor was quiet—mid-morning, most residents at work or elsewhere. Three steps. Four. Five.

Building 12 housed two hundred refugees. War survivors, climate migrants, people fleeing collapsed regions. Everyone from somewhere else. Everyone waiting for the same ending.

Ten steps. Eleven. Twelve. The elevator was at the end of the corridor, but Ibrahim never used it. Couldn't. Needed to count. Needed to know the number.

Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. He reached the stairwell and paused. Looked down four floors. Looked at his cane. Every day he considered taking the elevator. Every day he opened the stairwell door instead.

Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Down was easier than up. Gravity helped. But his leg still ached with each step. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. Twenty-seven.

A memory surfaced, unbidden: Jerusalem. Running across rooftops during patrol. Twenty years old, strong, fast, faithful. That Ibrahim could leap from building to building. Could climb walls. Could fight for hours without tiring.

That Ibrahim was dead.

Thirty-five. Thirty-six. Thirty-seven. Third-floor landing. A door opened—elderly woman, Korean, carrying a basket. She nodded at him. He nodded back. She took the elevator. He continued down.

Forty. Forty-one. Forty-two. The ache in his leg was constant now. Not sharp pain—he had medication for that. Just: persistent reminder that his body was broken. That he'd been broken. That breaking was permanent.

Forty-eight. Forty-nine. Fifty. Almost there. The ground floor lobby visible now. Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

Ground level.

Ibrahim stood at the base of the stairs, breathing slightly harder than he should. Fifty-three steps down. In a few hours, fifty-three steps back up. Same number every day. Same count. Same practice.

He didn't know why it mattered. But it did.

The lobby was mostly empty. A few residents checking mailboxes, one man sleeping on a bench—alcoholic, probably, or just exhausted with existing. The building manager's office was closed—had been for months. Staff shortages everywhere. Services declining. But the buildings stood. Heat worked. Water flowed. Enough.

Ibrahim walked through the lobby and out the main entrance.

The Antarctic megacity sprawled in every direction. Building 12 was in the outer residential zone—lower-density, quieter, cheaper. Refugee housing. The city center was visible in the distance, towers rising toward the gray sky. Four billion people once. Fewer now. Nobody counted anymore.

The cold hit immediately. Ibrahim pulled his jacket tighter. Antarctic winter meant darkness—twenty-hour nights, brief twilight, no true day. Artificial lights everywhere compensating. The street lamps were motion-activated, saving energy. They lit as he walked, died after he passed.

He had no destination. Never did. Just walked. Same route every day, more or less. Past Building 11. Past the communal garden—dormant now, winter killing everything. Past the transit stop where people waited for trains to somewhere else.

His leg ached with each step. Cane striking pavement. One step. Another. Another. The rhythm was meditative without him meaning it to be. Just: walk, ache, breathe, continue.

A small grocery was open on the corner. Ibrahim went inside. Warm air. Fluorescent lights. Automated checkout. Shelves half-stocked but adequate.

He bought bread, cheese, tea. Basic supplies. Enough for a few days. The automated system scanned his items, deducted from his refugee assistance account, processed without human interaction.

As he turned to leave, someone spoke: "Ibrahim?"

He looked up. Fatima—Jordanian woman, lived on his floor. Unit 417. Devout Muslim. Prayed five times daily. He'd been avoiding her for months.

"Hello, Fatima."

She smiled. Genuine warmth despite his coldness. "Shopping for Eid? It's tomorrow."

Eid. He'd lost track of the calendar. Eid al-Fitr—end of Ramadan, celebration of breaking fast. Holy day. Festival. Community gathering.

"I didn't realize," he said.

"We're having dinner in the community room. Building 12. Tomorrow evening. You should come."

Ibrahim felt the automatic refusal forming. He didn't do community. Didn't do gatherings. Especially not religious ones. Especially not with believers who still had what he'd lost.

But Fatima's face held no judgment. Just: invitation. Simple human kindness.

"I'll think about it," he said. Non-answer. Escape route.

"I hope you do. Eid is about community. About breaking fast together. You don't have to pray. Just: eat with us. Be present."

Be present. The phrase echoed strangely. Where else would he be? What else was there but presence?

"I'll think about it," he repeated.

She nodded and continued her shopping. Ibrahim left, carrying his groceries, feeling unsettled.

---

The walk back took longer. Always did—climbing hurt more than descending. But Ibrahim took his time. Counted each step.

One. Two. Three. The stairwell echoed with his footsteps and cane strikes. Five. Six. Seven. His leg was protesting now. Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

Halfway up, he paused on the second-floor landing. Caught his breath. An old habit surfaced—he used to make *du'a* at moments like this. Informal prayer. *Ya Allah, give me strength.* The words had come automatically for nineteen years.

Now: silence. No prayers. No appeals to absent God. Just: breathing. Waiting for the ache to become manageable.

He noticed a smell—mint. Sharp and clean. Coming from somewhere nearby. Ibrahim followed it without thinking. Around the corner. Unit 204's door was propped open, elderly woman sitting on a folding chair in the hallway, small balcony visible inside.

"Hello," she said. Korean accent. The woman from the stairwell earlier.

"Hello. I smelled..."

"Mint." She gestured to her balcony—visible through the open door. Small pots. Green herbs growing despite winter. "I grow what I can. Not much survives without sunlight, but mint is hardy."

Ibrahim stepped closer. The balcony was tiny—maybe two meters square. But she'd filled it with pots. Most held dead or dormant plants. But the mint thrived, green and vibrant.

"It's beautiful," he said, surprising himself.

"Thank you. I'm Min-seo." She stood slowly—older than him, maybe mid-sixties, but moving with care that suggested her own injuries.

"Ibrahim."

"Fourth floor? Unit 403? I see you counting stairs."

He flushed slightly. Embarrassed to be noticed. "I need to count."

"I understand. I count too. Days, mostly. But counting is counting." She gestured to the mint. "You want some? For tea?"

"I don't—" He stopped. Actually, he did want some. The smell was so alive. So present. So real. "Yes. Thank you."

She cut a small handful with scissors, wrapped it in cloth. "Use fresh. Much better than dried."

Ibrahim took it carefully. "Thank you, Min-seo."

"Come by again. I'm usually here mornings. Sitting helps the pain."

He nodded. Understood completely. Returned to the stairwell.

Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two. The mint's smell filled the stairwell. Sharp. Clean. Real. Thirty. Thirty-one. Thirty-two. His leg aching but bearable. Forty. Forty-one. Forty-two.

Fifty-one. Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

Fourth floor.

Ibrahim unlocked Unit 403. Set his groceries down. Put the mint in a cup of water. Watched the green leaves float there. Alive. Growing. Present.

He made tea. Added the fresh mint. The smell was incredible. He sat at his small table and drank slowly, tasting it. Really tasting it. Not just consuming but experiencing.

When had he last noticed something like this? Really noticed? Not background sensory data but actual observation. The mint was green. The tea was hot. The cup was heavy. The taste was sharp. These weren't profound observations. Just: facts. Present reality.

But somehow, right now, they felt like everything.

---

The next evening, Ibrahim stood outside the community room. Sounds of gathering inside—voices, laughter, the clatter of dishes. He'd spent all day deciding whether to come. Part of him wanted to go back upstairs. Return to his empty apartment. His quiet isolation. His nothing.

But Min-seo's mint was still on his windowsill. Still green. Still alive. And something about that aliveness made him open the door.

The community room held maybe forty people. Tables arranged in rows, food spread everywhere—traditional dishes from a dozen countries. The diversity of refugees made visible in cuisine. Jordanian *mansaf*. Syrian *kibbeh*. Kurdish rice. Yemeni stew.

Fatima spotted him immediately. Her face lit up. "Ibrahim! You came!"

"I'm just—" He didn't know how to finish the sentence. Just what? Just here? Just existing? Just trying?

"Come sit. Eat. Meet people."

She guided him to a table. Introduced him to others. Names blurred—too many, too fast. But faces were kind. Welcoming. No one asked about his faith or lack thereof. No one pressed him to pray. Just: sit, eat, be here.

He filled a plate. Ate slowly. The food was good. Real. Made with care by people who still bothered to cook despite everything.

A man sat next to him. American. Around forty. Quiet like Ibrahim. They nodded at each other—acknowledgment without demand for conversation.

"Derek," the man said after a moment.

"Ibrahim."

"Former soldier?"

Ibrahim glanced at his cane. "That obvious?"

"I recognize the walk. Marine. Two tours. You?"

"Militia. Jerusalem."

They sat in silence. Understanding passing between them without words. Both fighters. Both broken. Both here in this strange refugee community, eating Eid dinner despite neither being particularly devout.

"Do you believe anymore?" Derek asked quietly.

Ibrahim considered lying. Considered deflecting. Instead: "No."

"Me neither. Lost it somewhere between Kandahar and here." Derek ate some rice. "But the food's good. The people are kind. So I show up."

"Is that enough?"

"Don't know. But it's something."

Ibrahim thought about that. Something instead of nothing. Presence instead of absence. Showing up instead of hiding. Was that enough? He couldn't answer. But maybe not-answering was its own kind of answer.

Fatima called everyone to attention. "Before we finish, I want to thank everyone for coming. For being community. For sharing this Eid together. We're all far from home. All facing the same ending. But tonight: we're here. We're together. We're alive. That matters."

Simple words. Nothing profound. But around the room, people nodded. Agreed. Found meaning in the plainness of it.

Ibrahim found himself nodding too.

After dinner, he helped clean up. Washing dishes alongside strangers who felt less strange now. Small conversations. Nothing deep. Just: the weather's getting colder. The heating system makes that noise. Did you try the *kunafa*? Basic human interaction.

It was okay. Not good. Not meaningful. Not replacing what he'd lost. Just: okay.

Walking back to his apartment, Ibrahim felt something unfamiliar. Not happiness. Not peace. Just: less alone. Slightly. Temporarily. But real.

Unit 403. He made tea with Min-seo's mint. Sat at his table. Pulled out his prayer beads.

Ninety-nine beads. Ninety-nine names of God that meant nothing now. He held them. Moved through them without speaking. One bead. Another. Another. No names. No prayers. Just: touch. Count. Present.

The practice was empty of faith. But not empty of ritual. Not empty of presence. He was here, now, holding beads, counting, breathing. That was all. That was everything. That was enough for tonight.

Tomorrow he'd walk fifty-three steps down. Walk his route. Maybe visit Min-seo. Maybe not. Count his steps. Notice things. Exist without purpose or identity or belief.

Was that enough?

He still couldn't answer.

But maybe that was okay too.

## Year 6, Month 11 — Later

Winter deepened. The Antarctic darkness was nearly total now—twenty-two-hour nights, brief twilight, perpetual cold. The megacity's lights blazed constantly, fighting the darkness, consuming energy to maintain the illusion of day.

Ibrahim's routine continued. Fifty-three steps down every morning. Walk the same route. Fifty-three steps up every evening. Same count. Same rhythm.

But small things were changing.

He stopped at Min-seo's apartment twice more. Brief visits. She'd offer tea. They'd sit on her tiny balcony—freezing cold but real. She told him about Seoul. The coastal flooding that destroyed her neighborhood. Her children dead in the evacuation chaos. Her arrival in Antarctica alone.

"Do you regret surviving?" Ibrahim asked one morning.

Min-seo considered. "Sometimes. Most times. But then the mint grows. Or the sun breaks through for five minutes. Or someone like you visits for tea. And I think: okay. Today is okay."

"That's not much."

"No. But it's something. Something is better than nothing."

Derek became a fixture in Ibrahim's walks. They'd pass each other on the street. Nod. Sometimes walk together in silence. Former fighters who understood that companionship didn't require conversation. Just: presence. Acknowledgment. Not-being-alone.

One afternoon, Derek spoke: "I started going to group therapy. Veteran thing. Talking about war, trauma, all that. You should come."

"I don't talk."

"Neither do I, mostly. Just sit there. Listen. But it's... something. Better than sitting alone."

"I'll think about it."

"Liar." Derek smiled slightly. "But the offer stands."

Fatima continued inviting Ibrahim to things. Community dinners. Prayer groups (which he declined). Movie nights (which he attended once, awkwardly). She never pressured. Never judged. Just: kept offering. Kept including him.

"Why?" he asked her one evening. "Why keep inviting me? I'm not a believer anymore."

"Because you're a person," she said simply. "Because community isn't about belief. It's about showing up. Being present with each other. You do that. That's enough."

"I don't pray."

"So? I do. You don't. Both are okay. What matters is you're here. You're alive. You're trying. That's what we share."

Ibrahim didn't know what to say to that. So he said nothing. Just nodded. Accepted.

---

The fifty-three steps became meditation without him naming it as such. Every day. One step. Two steps. Three. His leg aching. Body protesting. But present with each step. Counting. Breathing. Existing.

Not thinking about past battles. Not thinking about Jerusalem. Not thinking about faith lost or brothers dead or the nineteen years he'd spent believing in something that revealed itself as empty.

Not thinking about the asteroid. Not thinking about nine years left. Not thinking about extinction.

Just: this step. This moment. This breath.

One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

The count was everything. The count was enough.

He didn't know he was practicing a philosophy. Didn't know a 118-year-old woman in Lagos was teaching the same presence. Didn't know her students were spreading the practice like seeds—landing in unexpected places, growing in unlikely soil.

He just knew: counting helped. Noticing helped. Being present with the mint and the tea and Min-seo's garden and Derek's silence and Fatima's kindness—all of it helped.

Not healed. Not fixed. Not restored.

Just: helped.

And maybe that was enough.

---

## Year 6, Month 11 — Final Week

Ibrahim stood on his tiny balcony—same size as Min-seo's, fourth floor instead of second. The Antarctic darkness was complete now. Winter solstice approaching. The stars were incredible—no light pollution reaching this far from city center, the cold air crystalline and clear.

He'd never paid attention to stars before. As a child in Syria, they'd been background. During militia years, they'd been navigation tools. Now: just stars. Beautiful. Distant. Indifferent.

Everything was indifferent. The universe didn't care about Ibrahim. Didn't care about faith or loss or broken legs or prayer beads. The asteroid was falling because physics, not punishment. People suffered because matter and biology, not divine plan.

This realization had broken him six years ago. Shattered his entire worldview. Left him empty and faithless and lost.

Now, standing in the cold, watching stars, he found he didn't mind so much.

The universe was indifferent. But Min-seo's mint grew anyway. But Derek walked past and nodded anyway. But Fatima invited him to dinner anyway. But the tea tasted good anyway. But fifty-three steps were fifty-three steps anyway.

None of it meant anything cosmic. None of it stopped the asteroid. None of it restored faith or purpose or identity.

But all of it was real. Present. Here. Now.

Was that enough?

Ibrahim still didn't know. But he was starting to think that not-knowing was okay. That uncertainty was survivable. That existence without meaning was still existence.

And existence was something.

His prayer beads sat on the windowsill inside. He brought them out. Held them in the cold. Ninety-nine beads. Ninety-nine names he didn't believe anymore.

But the beads were real. The weight was real. The counting was real.

He moved through them slowly. Not praying. Not speaking the names. Just: touching each bead. Counting. Breathing.

One bead. Another. Another. Present with each one.

Was this meditation? Practice? Meaningless ritual? He didn't know. Didn't need to know. The beads were in his hand. That was enough.

Around him, Building 12 was alive with small sounds. Someone cooking. Someone arguing. Someone laughing. Someone crying. Two hundred refugees living temporary lives in temporary housing, all waiting for the same ending.

But right now: alive. Here. Existing.

Ibrahim finished the beads. Ninety-nine. Same number as always. Same weight. Different meaning. Or no meaning. Or meaning he couldn't articulate yet.

He went inside. Made tea with Min-seo's mint. Sat at his table. Drank slowly, tasting it. Really tasting it.

Tomorrow: fifty-three steps down. His walk. Fifty-three steps up. Same count. Same routine.

Nine years left until the asteroid. Nine years of counting steps and noticing mint and drinking tea and maybe accepting Fatima's next invitation and maybe visiting Min-seo and maybe walking with Derek.

Nine years of being present without faith. Without purpose. Without identity.

Nine years of just: existing.

Was that enough?

He still couldn't answer.

But tonight, sitting in his small apartment, drinking mint tea, alive and breathing and noticing—tonight it felt like maybe it was.

Maybe existence without meaning was still worth existing.

Maybe presence without purpose was still worth being present.

Maybe life without faith was still worth living.

Maybe.

Ibrahim set down his empty cup. Looked at his prayer beads on the windowsill. The smooth wooden spheres caught the light. Ninety-nine names of God he didn't believe in. Ninety-nine beads he counted anyway.

Tomorrow he'd count fifty-three steps.

And that would be enough.

That would have to be enough.

That *was* enough.

He closed his eyes.

Breathed.

Noticed the breathing.

And for the first time in six years, felt something like peace. Not happiness. Not faith. Not certainty.

Just: peace with the uncertainty. Peace with the emptiness. Peace with the not-knowing.

Peace with being alive without understanding why.

Peace with fifty-three steps and mint tea and one bead after another.

Peace.

Maybe.

Yes.

Peace.
