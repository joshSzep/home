# Chapter 19: Community

**POV: Zara Okafor-Mensah (37) | Year 6, Month 3 | Lagos District**

---

The word "butterfly" was giving Kofi trouble.

"But-ter-fly," Maya said patiently, pointing at the picture book. "Three parts. Try again."

"But... butter... fly?" Kofi repeated, five years old and earnest. His finger traced the butterfly's wings on the page.

"Good! Now you've got it." Maya beamed at her brother. "See? You can read it."

Zara watched from the kitchen table, engineering schematics glowing on her display. The greywater reclamation system for their compound—fifty units, two hundred people, thirty thousand liters daily throughput. The calculations were straightforward. Design the filtration cascade, map the distribution network, optimize for pressure differentials. Work she'd done a hundred times before.

Work that would last maybe nine years.

But people needed clean water now. That was enough.

"Mama!" Kofi called. "I can read 'butterfly'!"

"I heard, baby. You're doing so well."

Kwame emerged from the bedroom, hair still damp from the shower, moving toward the kitchen with the easy comfort of someone who'd lived in this space for eight years. Their apartment—seventy square meters of manufactured domesticity—had absorbed their lives completely. Plants everywhere (Kwame's doing), children's drawings on the walls (Maya's artistic phase), engineering models scattered on surfaces (Zara's inability to leave work at work). Home. Real home. Temporary home.

Nine years left.

Zara pushed the thought away. Not now. Right now: Kofi learning to read. Maya teaching. Kwame making breakfast. Family existing in the present moment. That's all she could control.

"Synth-eggs?" Kwame asked.

"Please."

"Maya, breakfast in ten minutes."

"Okay, Papa!" Maya didn't look away from the book. "Now try 'caterpillar.' That's a hard one."

"Cat-er-pill-ar," Kofi sounded out carefully.

The morning light through their windows was Lagos District perfect—engineered tropical climate, bright and humid and alive. Six years into the apocalypse, the environmental systems still functioned. The sun still rose. Life continued because what else would it do?

Zara's wrist display chimed. Message from the compound housing committee: *Meeting tonight, 7 PM. Topic: rooftop garden expansion. Your input needed—engineering perspective.*

She confirmed attendance. Another meeting. Another project. Another temporary thing worth doing anyway.

---

The compound had changed in six years.

Year 0, it was just: fifty units of apartments, two hundred strangers sharing infrastructure. Polite nods in hallways. Brief conversations in elevators. The typical urban disconnection that came from living close but not together.

Year 6: community. Actual community.

It happened gradually. Someone organized shared meals after the first suicide wave—Month 6, when the reality settled in. Someone else started collective childcare so parents could work or rest or grieve. Someone planted herbs on their balcony and offered cuttings to neighbors. Small gestures accumulating into structure.

Now: the compound felt like a village transplanted into an apartment building. Twenty units participated actively. Thirty more occasionally. Shared resources—tools, skills, time, food. Shared grief. Shared presence. Not a commune. Not utopia. Just: people supporting people because the alternative was isolation.

Zara contributed engineering. Fixed water systems. Optimized power usage. Designed the solar expansion that kept their building independent when district grid failed. Kwame contributed carpentry—built the shared workspace, repaired furniture, taught others basic skills. Maya and Kofi contributed youth—reminded everyone what they were living for.

Everyone gave what they could. Everyone took what they needed. It worked. Mostly.

---

After breakfast, Zara walked to her workspace—small office in the compound's converted storage room. Four other engineers shared it, though only she and Tom showed up regularly. The others had quit, fled, or died.

Tom was already there, running fluid dynamics simulations. Fifty years old, quiet, competent. Worked at the district water authority until Year 3, when they downsized to skeleton crew. Now: freelance engineering for whoever needed it, which was everyone and no one.

"Morning," Tom said without looking up.

"Morning. Working on the greywater filtration?"

"Trying to optimize the cascade. The pressure differential in stage three is marginal."

Zara looked at his simulation. Saw the problem immediately. "Increase the holding tank volume by fifteen percent. Gives you better residence time."

"Won't fit the current rooftop configuration."

"So we expand the configuration. That's what tonight's meeting is about."

Tom finally looked at her. "You're serious? The rooftop garden expansion?"

"Why not?"

"Nine years, Zara. The building might not last nine years. The district might not last nine years. We might not—"

"We need food now," Zara interrupted. "We need community now. We need something to tend besides despair. So: yes. Serious."

Tom was quiet for a moment. Then: "You're right. I'll adjust the tank specs."

That was the argument Zara had been making for six years. Not: this will matter forever. Just: this matters now. The engineering work wouldn't save anyone. Wouldn't stop the asteroid. Wouldn't extend life beyond fifteen years. But people needed water now. Needed food now. Needed something to build, something to maintain, something to care about besides the countdown.

Gift work, Wei called it. Labor without expectation of permanence. Zara had learned that in the garden, watching Wei tend plants that would bloom and die and bloom again. Everything temporary. Everything valuable. Engineering was just applied gardening.

---

Lunchtime: visit to Wei's apartment.

Zara brought the children twice weekly—Tuesdays and Fridays, regular as clockwork. The old professor was 119 now, body failing visibly. Needed full-time care that a young nurse named Ling provided. Wei's mind remained sharp, but her body was finishing its transformation.

Natural death would claim Wei before the asteroid. Maybe months. Maybe a year. Zara grieved this already, the way you grieve something inevitable while it's still present.

They found Wei in her wheelchair on the balcony, surrounded by the garden that had become her classroom. The lemon tree fruiting. The gardenias blooming. The herbs spreading in their containers. Six years of tending, and the garden was more alive than ever.

"Professor Wei!" Kofi ran ahead, all energy and affection.

"Careful," Zara called automatically.

"Let him run," Wei said, her voice thinner than last week but still clear. "Gardens are for living in."

Maya approached more carefully, carrying a picture she'd drawn. "I made this for you. It's the butterflies we saw last time."

Wei took the picture with shaking hands. Studied it seriously. "You remembered the wing pattern. Very precise. That's important—seeing what's actually there, not what we expect to see."

"Mama says you taught her that."

"Your mother was excellent student. Still is. She teaches me things now too."

Zara settled on the bench while Kofi explored and Maya showed Wei her latest school work. This was the rhythm they'd established over six years—visiting, tending, being present. Wei teaching without teaching. Just: observations about flowers, butterflies, the way light shifted through leaves. Philosophy made practical.

Ling brought tea. Zara helped Wei hold the cup—hands too shaky now to manage alone. The intimacy of this—helping someone drink—felt profound. Physical care as teaching. Vulnerability as wisdom.

"Maya understands about the asteroid," Wei said quietly, watching the girl examine a beetle. "You told her Year 4?"

"Yes. She asked directly. I couldn't lie."

"Good. Children handle truth better than adults. Less time to build illusions." Wei sipped carefully. "How does she seem?"

Zara considered this. How did Maya seem? Serious. Calm. Too calm sometimes. Eight years old and already thinking about death, impermanence, the end of everything. Was that wisdom or trauma? Zara still didn't know.

"She's... steady," Zara said finally. "Handles it better than I do. Sometimes I think she's absorbing your teaching. Sometimes I think she's just—" She stopped, not sure how to finish.

"Just living," Wei completed. "Children do that naturally. Adults have to relearn it. Maya's practicing presence because that's her nature. When she's older, the fear will come. Then she'll need the practice she's building now."

"Nine years," Zara whispered. "Maya will be seventeen. Kofi will be fourteen."

"Yes. Not enough time. Never enough time. But right now—" Wei gestured at the children. Kofi crouched by the herb garden, talking to the mint. Maya reading her book in the shade. "Right now, alive. Right now, here. That's all time ever is."

Zara felt the tears coming. Fought them. Lost. Wei's thin hand found hers.

"Cry," Wei said. "Grief is appropriate. Fear is appropriate. Love is appropriate. All of it together. That's what being human means."

So Zara cried. Quietly, so the children wouldn't see. Grieving nine years that felt both infinite and impossible. Wei held her hand and said nothing more. Sometimes silence taught more than words.

---

Kwame found her when she got home, saw her face, understood immediately.

"Wei?" he asked.

"Just... everything. The countdown. The children. Nine years."

He held her. They'd had this conversation a hundred times over six years. Different words, same grief. Parents facing their children's certain death. The cruelty of knowing exactly when. The gift of knowing to treasure every moment. Both true simultaneously.

"Do you regret it?" Kwame asked. The question came up periodically. "Having Kofi?"

"Never," Zara said fiercely. "You?"

"Never. But I fear for them. Every day. Every moment."

"So do I. But they're here. They're real. Their lives matter."

"For nine years."

"For nine years. Which is nine more years than not existing at all. Which is infinite compared to nothing." Zara pulled back, looked at her husband. "We chose this. We chose life. I stand by that choice."

Kwame nodded. "So do I."

They stood in their kitchen, holding each other, while Maya and Kofi played in the next room. The engineering schematics still glowed on Zara's display. The compound meeting waited tonight. The countdown continued—nine years, eight months, roughly. But right now: this moment. This presence. This choice to keep building, keep loving, keep tending temporary things.

Enough.

---

The compound meeting started at seven.

Twenty neighbors gathered in the shared workspace—converted storage room on the ground floor. Chairs borrowed from apartments. Projection screen showing architectural plans. Coffee brewing in the corner. The ordinary infrastructure of community organizing.

Zara had helped establish these meetings Year 2. Monthly gatherings to discuss collective issues, plan projects, maintain connection. Attendance fluctuated—twenty tonight, sometimes fifteen, once as many as thirty-five. But consistent enough to matter.

Mr. Okonkwo (elderly, skeptical, reliable) called the meeting to order. "Rooftop garden expansion. Zara, you want to present?"

Zara pulled up the plans—engineering drawings showing the expanded garden layout, water system integration, structural load calculations. "Current rooftop: forty square meters of growing space. Produces maybe thirty percent of our compound's vegetables. Proposed expansion: one hundred twenty square meters. Gets us to eighty percent self-sufficiency."

"For nine years," Mr. Okonkwo said.

"For nine years," Zara agreed. "For however long we have. For now."

Silence. The math was always there. Nine years. 3,285 days. Then: nothing. Why build gardens that wouldn't last? Why plan for a future that didn't exist?

Adanna spoke up—young mother, fierce, practical. Zara liked her. "My son needs food now. Not in nine years. Now. My son needs to see things growing. Needs to help water plants. Needs to understand that caring for things matters even if they end. So: yes. I vote yes."

"Costs?" someone asked.

"Materials are cheap," Tom said. "Labor abundant. Water system ties into existing infrastructure. Maintenance minimal. Real cost is: deciding it's worth doing."

More silence. The psychological cost—committing to a project that wouldn't outlast them. Choosing to build, knowing the building was temporary. That was the real expense.

"I vote yes," Kwame said. "Gardens matter. Growing food matters. Teaching our children to tend life matters. Nine years is long enough to justify planting."

Others nodded. The sentiment spreading. Yes. Why not? What else were they doing with their time besides counting down?

Mr. Okonkwo cleared his throat. "I'm old. Seventy-three. Probably dead before the asteroid anyway. But: I grew up farming. Before the climate shifts. Before the mega-cities. I know how to grow food." He paused. "I vote yes. I'll help design the planting layout."

Zara felt something shift in the room. Permission, maybe. Permission to commit. Permission to care about temporary things. Permission to choose life.

The vote was unanimous. Twenty people choosing gardens over despair. Choosing to build something that wouldn't last. Choosing presence.

After, Adanna approached Zara. "Your kids are beautiful. Maya teaches the other children, you know. Shares her books. Explains hard things simply. She's special."

"She's seven," Zara said. "She's just... being seven."

"She's being seven during the apocalypse. That's different. That's harder. She's doing it with grace." Adanna's hand went to her own son, sleeping in a carrier. "Thank you for having Kofi. For showing us that life is still worth choosing. People judged you. But you were right."

Zara felt the tears threatening again. "I don't know if I was right. I just know he's here. He's real. He matters."

"That's the same thing."

Maybe it was.

---

Night. Children sleeping.

Zara did her ritual—checking on them before bed. Maya's room first. Eight years old, tall for her age, curled around her favorite book. *The Butterfly Life Cycle.* Gift from Wei. Maya had read it dozens of times, absorbing the lesson about transformation, impermanence, change from within.

Nine years from now: Maya would be seventeen. Just reaching adulthood, then nothing. Never would finish university. Never would start a career. Never would have children of her own. Just: childhood, adolescence, one year of being an adult. Then nothing.

But right now: sleeping peacefully, clutching her book, dreaming about butterflies or words or whatever eight-year-olds dreamed about.

Zara kissed her daughter's forehead. Whispered: "You matter. Your brief life matters. I promise."

Kofi's room next. Five years old, already in school, clutching his stuffed elephant. His favorite toy. Would probably be his favorite toy until the end. How many things would Kofi experience in fourteen years? First words (done). First day of school (done). First friend, first book read alone, first understanding of death. Limited catalog. Brief catalog. But his catalog. His life. His consciousness.

Zara kissed him too. Whispered: "Nine years. We'll make them beautiful. I promise."

She stood in the doorway between their rooms, looking at her children, feeling the weight of every choice that led to this moment. Choosing pregnancy after detection. Defending that choice against strangers. Raising them with presence, with love, with truth. Teaching them that brief didn't mean meaningless.

Wei's voice in her memory: *Everything temporary. Everything valuable.*

The countdown continued—nine years, eight months, eleven days. The asteroid approached at perfect velocity. Impact was inevitable. But right now: her children existed. Her family existed. Her community existed. Gardens would be planted. Water would be filtered. Life would be tended.

That was enough. Had to be enough. Was enough.

Kwame appeared beside her, wrapped his arm around her waist. They stood together, watching their sleeping children, saying nothing. What was there to say? Everything was understood. Everything was felt. Everything was present.

Tomorrow: engineering work would continue. Wei's garden would be visited. Compound gardens would be planned. The countdown would advance one more day. Maya would teach Kofi more letters. The lemon tree would be watered. Robot maintenance would happen somewhere in Antarctica. Elena would govern. Amara would calculate. Kenji would wander. Ibrahim would count his steps. David would calibrate platforms. Everyone continuing their practice, their presence, their small defiances against ending.

Life. Despite everything. Because of everything. Simple. Complex. Temporary. Eternal. Brief. Infinite.

Enough.

Zara closed the children's doors quietly. Followed Kwame to their room. Tomorrow would bring its own joys, its own griefs, its own moments of presence. But tonight: sleep. Rest. The temporary peace of family safe under one roof.

Nine years to make beautiful.

Starting tomorrow.

Again.

Always.
