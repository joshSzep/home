# Chapter 23: The Call

**Dr. Amara Okafor | Year 7, Month 9 | Antarctic Monitoring Station**

---

Midnight.

The monitoring station hummed its familiar lullaby—cooling systems, data processors, the soft whir of automated tracking arrays. Amara Okafor sat alone at her workstation, the only occupied seat among sixty, the only human presence in a facility designed for constant surveillance.

Seven years. Two thousand, five hundred fifty-five days since detection. Sixty-one thousand, three hundred twenty hours. Three million, six hundred seventy-nine thousand, two hundred minutes.

She updated the trajectory. Observation 127,394. The asteroid was precisely where physics said it would be—deviation from prediction: 0.00002%. Perfect. Predictable. Inevitable.

**Countdown: 8 years, 3 months, 5 days remaining.**

Her tea had gone cold again. She couldn't remember making it. An hour ago? Three? Time was still elastic at midnight in an empty building, stretching and compressing in ways that mocked the precision of her calculations.

The station lights were motion-activated now—power conservation protocols. They flickered on as she walked the corridors, checking systems that checked themselves. Then darkness followed her, lights dying in her wake. They'd moved to this smaller facility Year 3—twenty workstations instead of sixty, fifty dormitory rooms instead of three hundred. More efficient, they said. More appropriate for diminished staff.

Now even this smaller building was too large. All twenty workstations silent. All fifty dormitory rooms empty except one. A facility built for essential operations now housing one woman who'd forgotten how to be human.

She was the last. Dr. Kim quit Year 5—went to Tokyo to spend time with grandchildren. Dr. Patel transferred Year 6, citing "personal reasons" that everyone understood. The younger researchers had fled earlier. Now: just Amara and the machines and the infinite silence of space.

She preferred it. Told herself she preferred it.

No awkward small talk. No colleagues trying to be supportive. No one asking how she was doing. Just her and the data and the countdown that ticked forward with perfect mathematical precision.

The monitoring systems were fully automated. Had been for six years. The global telescope network fed data directly to the AI processors. Trajectory calculations updated in real-time. Amara's presence was unnecessary. The machines could do everything she did, faster and more accurately.

But she showed up anyway. Every night. Checking calculations that didn't need checking. Updating models that didn't need updating. Maintaining a vigil that served no purpose beyond giving her something to do.

Something to be.

She returned to her workstation and pulled up her secondary dataset—the one she'd been maintaining since Year 2. Global mortality statistics. Aggregate deaths across all causes, updated daily from what remained of the UN Health Coordination Network.

**Total deaths Years 1-7: 2,847,291,438**

Nearly three billion people. Dead in seven years. Not from the asteroid—that came later. From despair, from violence, from the abandonment of will. Suicides still climbing—up 520% from baseline now. Homicides up 410%. "Natural causes" down 71%—people weren't living long enough to die of old age anymore.

Amara processed this scientifically. Created graphs showing mortality trends by region, by cause, by demographic. Projected future deaths based on current acceleration. Her model predicted total pre-impact deaths would reach 4.7 billion. Nearly sixty percent of current population, gone before the asteroid arrived.

She filed the report. Sent it to the UN Mortality Database. No one responded. No one ever responded. The reports went into the archive, read by no one, useful to no one. But someone should document. Someone should count. Someone should say: these deaths happened, these lives ended.

Even if the record itself would end.

Even if the counter herself was already gone.

The numbers didn't hurt anymore. That was the important thing. She could look at three billion deaths and feel nothing. The numbness was complete now. Protective. Necessary. If she let herself feel what the numbers represented, she'd shatter into pieces too small to calculate.

Better to stay numb. Better to keep counting. Better to exist in the data where emotions couldn't reach.

Her message queue showed 1,243 unread. She'd stopped checking two years ago. Stopped responding five years ago. The queue was mostly automated alerts now—system updates, data confirmations, trajectory verifications. But buried in there: messages from Zara. From David. From colleagues who'd tried to stay in touch before giving up.

Amara's hand hovered over the delete button. One click and they'd all vanish. Clean data streams only. No human connection. No emotional vulnerability. No risk of feeling anything at all.

Her finger didn't press.

Instead—and she didn't know why, couldn't have explained the impulse if asked—she opened Zara's folder.

473 messages spanning seven years.

She scrolled through the timestamps. Year 1: daily messages. Year 2: weekly. Year 3: bi-weekly. Year 4: monthly. Year 5-7: every few months. The frequency declining as Zara's hope faded, as her sister disappeared more completely into data and isolation.

Amara opened the most recent message. From three weeks ago.

A video. Zara in a garden in Lagos, afternoon sunlight streaming through the lemon tree that had been growing for years. Two children visible—Maya (9 years old now, tall and serious, reading a book in the shade) and Kofi (6 years old, laughing at something off-camera, chasing a butterfly through the flowers).

Zara looked directly into the camera. Older than Amara remembered. Gray threading through her hair. Lines around her eyes. But present. Alive. Real.

"Amara." Her sister's voice was flat. Not angry. Not sad. Just: tired. "This is my last message. I'm not angry anymore. I was for a long time—years, honestly. Angry that you calculated our deaths and then vanished. Angry that you chose isolation over family. Angry that Maya and Kofi have an aunt they'll never meet."

She paused. Watched Kofi chase his butterfly. "Professor Wei is our neighbor. Our teacher. She's 122 years old now, still teaching from her garden even as her body fails. She's never met you, but she knows about you. Says you're hiding from life by burying yourself in death. Says the calculations are armor against feeling anything at all."

Zara looked back at the camera. "She was right. I see that now. You're not calculating because it matters. You're calculating because it's safe. Because numbers don't ask anything of you. Because data doesn't love you back and can't be lost."

Another pause. Longer. Maya looked up from her book, noticed her mother recording, smiled slightly and returned to reading.

"I'm not asking you to fix yourself," Zara continued. "I'm not asking you to be okay. I know you're not. But Amara—" Her voice cracked slightly. "—you have family who loves you. Maya and Kofi ask about their Aunt Amara. They've seen pictures. They want to meet you. Kwame asks if you're okay. I tell him I don't know. I haven't known for seven years."

She wiped her eyes. "This is my last message. If you want to be part of this family, you know where to find us. If you don't, I understand. But I'm done reaching out. I have eight years left with my children. I'm spending them present, not chasing a ghost."

The video ended. Kofi's laughter echoing in the background before cutting to silence.

Amara stared at the frozen final frame. Her sister's face, mid-wipe, tears and sunlight and exhaustion all visible. Behind her: Maya reading, Kofi playing, life continuing despite extinction.

She should respond. She knew this intellectually. Should send a message: "I'm alive. I'm sorry. I love you." Simple. Human. Required.

Her fingers hovered over the reply button. Had hovered there for seven years.

What would she say?

*Sorry I calculated your children's deaths and then vanished into data*?

*Sorry I can't access emotions anymore*?

*Sorry I chose numbness over connection and now I don't know how to choose anything else*?

The truth was simpler and worse: she'd been afraid. Not of the asteroid. Not of death. Of *feeling* the asteroid. Of *feeling* death. Of looking at her niece and nephew and *feeling* what their seventeen and fourteen-year-old deaths would mean.

So she'd chosen calculation. Chosen isolation. Chosen the safety of numbers over the vulnerability of love.

And now she'd been alone for so long she didn't know how to be anything else.

Amara closed the message. Returned to her calculations. Updated the trajectory. Verified the data. Counted down the days. This was familiar. This was safe. This was—

Her hands were shaking.

She stared at them, trembling over the haptic interface. When had that started? She tried to still them, couldn't. The tremor had been getting worse for months. Years, maybe. She'd ignored it, attributed it to lack of sleep, to too much caffeine, to anything except what it actually was:

Her body protesting what her mind refused to acknowledge.

Amara pushed back from her workstation. Stood. Walked the empty corridors, lights flickering on and off in her wake. Twenty workstations. Fifty dormitories. Even this reduced facility designed for essential staff, for minimal community, for some human connection.

All empty except for her.

She'd moved in after the divorce. Year 4, Month 4. David had tried one last time to reach her. Showed up at her workstation at 4 AM. Brought tea. Tried to talk. She'd felt nothing. Said nothing that mattered. He'd left. Filed separation papers two weeks later.

She'd signed them without reading. The marriage had been dead for years anyway. Just took David longer to admit it.

The facility had dormitory rooms—small, functional, sufficient. She'd moved into one. Never left. Worked eighteen-hour shifts. Slept four hours. Ate nutrient bars and cold tea. Stopped going outside. Stopped seeing daylight. Stopped being anything except the calculations she performed.

Three years divorced. Seven years isolated. And now Zara's last message sitting in her queue like an ultimatum she couldn't answer.

Amara found herself in the old break room. Designed for thirty people. Coffee station, food prep area, tables where colleagues used to gather. All dark now. All silent. She sat at one of the tables, in the darkness, and tried to remember what it felt like to be human.

The memory wouldn't come.

She couldn't remember the last time she'd laughed. Couldn't remember the last time she'd felt anything except the dull, constant pressure of existence. Couldn't remember what Zara's voice sounded like outside of recorded messages. Couldn't remember Maya as anything except a two-year-old at her first birthday party, seven years and a lifetime ago.

Kofi she'd never met. Her nephew. Six years old. Laughing at butterflies in a garden she'd never seen.

The thought should hurt. Should pierce the numbness. Should make her *feel* something.

It didn't.

And that—finally—did.

Amara sat in the darkness of the empty break room and felt the absence where her emotions should be. Felt the void where her humanity used to live. Felt, for the first time in seven years, the full weight of what she'd chosen.

Safety over vulnerability. Calculation over connection. Isolation over love.

And the worst part: she didn't know if she could choose differently. Didn't know if the person who could feel, could love, could connect—if that person still existed inside her or if she'd successfully calculated her away.

Her hands were still shaking.

She looked at them in the darkness. Noticed, really noticed, how thin they'd become. How the tremor never quite stopped. How they looked like an old woman's hands, weathered and worn despite being only fifty-seven.

Her body was failing. Slowly. The isolation eating her from the inside out. She'd lost weight—how much, she didn't know. Didn't own a scale. Didn't care. Sleep was broken, four hours snatched between calculations. Headaches came frequently now. Her vision blurred sometimes.

The machines could track asteroids forever.

Humans couldn't.

She couldn't.

The realization arrived with perfect clarity: she was dying. Not from the asteroid. From loneliness. From the choice to be numb instead of human. And she had maybe a year, maybe two, before the isolation finished what the numbness started.

Eight years until the asteroid.

But she wouldn't last eight years. Not like this.

Amara stood. Walked back to her workstation. Lights flickering on, following her through the tomb she'd made of her life. Even the smaller facility felt too large when you were the only person left.

She sat down. Stared at her monitors. The asteroid approaching. The countdown ticking. The data streaming in perfect, pointless precision.

Then she closed the trajectory calculations.

Opened her message queue.

Found Zara's contact.

Her finger hovered over the call button. Seven years of avoidance. Seven years of choosing safety over risk, calculation over connection. Seven years of telling herself she preferred the isolation, the numbness, the absence of feeling.

All lies.

All armor.

All ways of avoiding the truth she'd been running from since the moment she detected the asteroid: everyone was going to die, including the people she loved, and there was nothing she could do except witness their brief, beautiful, doomed existence.

That had terrified her. So she'd chosen not to witness. Chosen to calculate instead. Chosen absence over presence because presence meant feeling loss and loss was unbearable.

But absence was worse.

Amara pressed the call button.

It rang. Once. Twice. Three times. She almost disconnected. Almost retreated back into the safety of silence. Almost chose calculation again.

Then: "Hello?"

Zara's voice. Live. Real. Not recorded. After seven years of one-way messages, her sister's voice asking a simple question in real time.

Amara's throat closed. She couldn't speak. Couldn't form words. Seven years of silence and suddenly her voice didn't work.

"Hello?" Zara repeated. More cautious now. "Who is this?"

"It's me." Barely a whisper. Barely audible. But there.

Silence on the other end. Long enough that Amara wondered if the connection had dropped. Then:

"Amara?"

Shock in the word. Disbelief. And underneath it: something Amara couldn't name. Hope? Anger? Relief? All three?

"Yes." Stronger now. "It's me. I—" What? What could she possibly say? "I got your message. Your last message. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. For seven years. For—"

"Are you okay?" Zara's voice cut through her apology. Not harsh. Just: direct. The engineering pragmatism Amara remembered from before everything fractured.

"No." The truth came easier than she expected. "No, I'm not okay. I haven't been okay in seven years. I've been hiding. You were right. Professor Wei was right. I've been choosing data over life. Calculation over connection. I've been—" Her voice cracked. "—I've been disappearing and I don't know how to stop."

Silence again. Amara could hear something in the background. Voices? Children? Life continuing in Lagos while she sat alone in an empty facility in Antarctica.

"Why are you calling now?" Zara asked finally. Not accusatory. Just: asking. Trying to understand.

"Because I can't do this anymore." Simple truth. "Because seven years alone is enough. Because I'm dying, Zara. Not from the asteroid. From isolation. From numbness. From choosing safety over everything else. And I—" The words came hard, scraped from somewhere deep. "—I want to meet my niblings. If you'll let me. I want to know Maya and Kofi before it's too late. I want to be your sister again. If that's possible. If I haven't—"

"Of course." Zara's voice was soft now. Careful. "Of course you can meet them. They want to meet you too."

Something in Amara's chest cracked. Not broke—cracked. Like ice under pressure, the first fracture in seven years of frozen numbness.

"Thank you," she whispered.

"But Amara." Zara's tone shifted. Firmer. "I need you to understand something. If you do this—if you come here, if you meet Maya and Kofi—you don't get to disappear again. You don't get to calculate their deaths and then vanish. You either show up or you don't. But you can't half-show-up. They deserve better. I deserve better."

"I know." And she did. For the first time in seven years, she understood. "I know. I'll show up. I promise. I don't know how yet. I don't know if I can feel things like I used to. I don't know if the numbness will let go. But I'll show up. I'll be present. Even if it hurts. Especially if it hurts."

"Okay." Zara took a breath. "Okay. Then tell me—are you still in Antarctica? At the monitoring station?"

"Yes. I live here now. Moved in after David and I—" She couldn't finish.

"I heard about the divorce. I'm sorry."

"Don't be. It was my fault. I disappeared from him too. Disappeared from everyone."

"So come here," Zara said. "Come to Lagos. Stay with us. Meet your niblings. See the garden. Meet the community. Be present for whatever time we have left."

The invitation hung in the air. Amara tried to imagine it: leaving the station, leaving Antarctica, leaving the calculations and the isolation and the safety of emptiness. Tried to imagine meeting Maya and Kofi. Seeing them laugh and play and be alive despite being doomed.

The thought terrified her.

The thought felt like the first real choice she'd made in seven years.

"When?" she heard herself ask.

"Whenever you're ready. Tomorrow. Next month. Next year. But Amara—" Zara paused. "—don't wait too long. We have eight years left. That sounds like a lot. It isn't."

"I know." And she did. She'd been counting those years down to the minute. "I'll come soon. I need to—" What? Finish calculations that would never end? Clean up data no one needed? "I need to arrange things here. Close out some projects. Maybe a month?"

"A month is fine. We'll be here. We're always here."

They talked for two hours after that. Awkward at first, halting, full of seven years of silence that couldn't be bridged in one conversation. But they talked.

Zara updated her on Maya: nine years old, brilliant and serious, reading far above grade level. Obsessed with science, with understanding how things worked. "She's like you," Zara said. "Scary smart. Sees patterns everywhere. But she's also present. She feels things. She cries at sad stories. She laughs when Kofi is silly. She's balanced in a way you and I never quite managed."

And Kofi: six years old, joyful and curious, always in motion. "He's pure life," Zara said. "He doesn't understand extinction intellectually. He knows in eight years everyone dies. But it doesn't weigh on him the way it weighs on Maya. He's just—present. Happy. Alive. He makes everyone around him more alive too."

Zara talked about Kwame, still steady, still working as an engineer despite everything. About their apartment compound, how neighbors had formed a tight community. About Professor Wei, their neighbor—122 years old now, body failing but mind sharp, still teaching from her garden. "She's the wisest person I've ever met," Zara said. "She teaches by just being present. Just noticing things. The children love her. I think you would too."

Amara listened. Didn't share much—what would she share? Seven years of calculations meant nothing compared to Zara's life. But she listened. Really listened. Let her sister's words seep past the numbness, past the armor, past the fear.

And slowly, molecule by molecule, something in her began to thaw.

"I should let you go," Zara said finally. "It's late here. The children have school tomorrow—yes, we still do school. Kofi's in first grade. He's learning to read compound words. But-ter-fly, he says. Three parts."

Amara felt something in her chest. Not quite emotion. More like: the memory of what emotion felt like. The promise that it might return.

"Thank you," she said. "For answering. For not—for giving me another chance."

"You're my sister," Zara said simply. "I love you. Even when you disappear. Even when you choose data over family. I still love you. That doesn't change."

The words landed like hammer blows. Love. Present tense. Despite everything. Despite seven years of absence and silence and choosing numbness over connection.

Unconditional.

"I love you too," Amara whispered. And meant it. Even if she couldn't feel it fully yet. Even if the words came from some deep, frozen place that might never completely thaw. She meant it.

"Good," Zara said. "Now go sleep. You sound exhausted. And Amara? When you come here—bring data if you need to. Bring calculations if they help. But also bring yourself. The actual you. The sister I remember. The aunt Maya and Kofi deserve to meet. Can you do that?"

Could she? Amara didn't know. The numbness was still there. The armor still thick. Seven years of isolation couldn't be undone in one phone call.

But maybe it could crack. Maybe the ice could start to melt.

"I'll try," she said.

"That's enough. That's all I'm asking. Just try."

They ended the call. 3:17 AM. The station silent around her. The monitoring systems humming. The asteroid approaching with perfect, indifferent precision.

**Countdown: 8 years, 3 months, 5 days remaining.**

Amara sat at her workstation and felt the weight of seven years begin to lift. Not completely. Not even mostly. But: slightly. Measurably. Real.

She pulled up her trajectory calculations. Looked at them with new eyes. This data mattered—someone should track the asteroid, should document its approach, should bear witness to the mechanics of extinction.

But it wasn't the only thing that mattered.

It wasn't even the most important thing.

She opened a new file. Began making notes. Preparations for Lagos: arrange transport, notify facility administration, archive essential data, set up remote access for monitoring systems. One month to close out projects that would never truly be finished. One month to prepare for the most terrifying thing she'd done in seven years.

Showing up. Being present. Letting herself feel.

The notes felt inadequate. But they were something. A start.

She thought about David. Her ex-husband. Three years divorced, barely communicating. He was still in Antarctica, still maintaining solar arrays that would vaporize in eight years. Still choosing work as meaning, same as her.

They were parallel. Both isolated. Both numbed by routine. Both hiding from connection behind professional competence.

She could reach out. Could call him. Could try reconnecting.

The thought terrified her.

One step at a time, she told herself. Sister first. Niblings. Family she'd abandoned. Then—maybe—ex-husband. If she had courage left. If reconnecting with Zara didn't break her completely.

Amara returned to her preparations. One month. Then Lagos. Then whatever came after.

She glanced at the countdown display.

**8 years, 3 months, 5 days remaining.**

For seven years, she'd watched that number decrease with scientific detachment. Just data. Just mathematics. Just the inevitable approach of extinction.

Now, for the first time, she felt it differently.

Not as countdown to death.

As countdown to life.

Eight years left. Time to stop calculating. Time to start living. Time to show up for the people who loved her despite everything.

Time to be human again. Even if it hurt. Especially if it hurt.

Amara closed her trajectory calculations. Shut down the monitoring displays. Stood and walked to her dormitory room—fifty steps through empty corridors, lights flickering on and off.

She lay in bed. Stared at the ceiling. Felt the silence of the station pressing down.

But underneath it: something new. Something fragile and terrifying and real.

Hope.

Not for survival. Not for deflection. Not for miraculous salvation.

Just: hope that she could change. That numbness could thaw. That seven years of isolation didn't have to define her eight years remaining.

Hope that she could be sister, aunt, human again.

It was enough.

For now, it was enough.

She closed her eyes and slept—not well, not deeply, but better than she had in seven years. And dreamed of butterflies in a garden she'd never seen, chased by a nephew she'd never met, while a niece she barely remembered read quietly in the shade.

Present. Alive. Real.

Waiting for their aunt to finally come home.
