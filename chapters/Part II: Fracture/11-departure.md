# Chapter 11: Departure

**POV: Kenji Torres | Year 1, Month 6 | Antarctic Megacity**

---

The apartment was already mostly empty.

Kenji stood in the center of his research housing unit—the place he'd lived for six years, through his PhD work, through the detection, through the year of spiraling—and realized he'd accumulated almost nothing worth keeping. A few clothes. Some books he'd already donated. The terminal that held his unfinished dissertation, now wiped clean.

Everything else was borrowed, institutional, or meaningless.

He'd started packing three days ago. Finished in two hours.

The emptiness felt appropriate. You couldn't carry much when you were going everywhere and nowhere. When the destination was "away" and the purpose was "find something, anything, that makes sense."

His reflection in the dark window looked like a stranger. Thinner than a year ago—the substances and skipped meals had taken their toll. Hollow around the eyes. Twenty-five years old but looking older, worn. The bright PhD candidate who'd had his future mapped was gone. This person in the window was someone else. Someone lost. Someone leaving.

Behind him, the apartment door opened. His mother's keycode—she was one of three people who had access. The others were building security and the emergency medical team. Nobody had needed the medical override yet, though there'd been close calls during the worst months.

"Mijo," Elena said softly.

Kenji turned. His mother looked exhausted—eighteen months of governing the apocalypse etched into every line of her face. She'd aged a decade in the year and a half since detection. Still showed up every morning. Still held briefings. Still maintained order for a population that had shrunk from four billion to just under three billion and falling.

"Mom."

"I brought tea." She held up a thermos. "And those honey cakes you used to like. I don't know if you still..." She trailed off, uncertain.

"I do. Thank you." He took the thermos, gestured to the floor since he'd already packed his chairs. They sat against the wall like they were teenagers sneaking into an empty apartment, not a mayor and her son in his own place.

Elena poured tea into the thermos cap, handed it to him. They sat in silence for a moment. Through the window, the Antarctic sprawl stretched endlessly—lights and structures and three billion people trying to live normally in abnormal times.

"You don't have to go," Elena said finally. Not pleading. Just: stating fact.

"I know."

"You could stay. Help me govern. Or not govern—just be here. Be home."

"I can't." Kenji sipped the tea. Still too hot. "Antarctica feels like... like we're all sitting in a waiting room. Just sitting. Waiting for the appointment we can't cancel."

"That's what everywhere is now."

"Maybe. But here it's worse. Everyone knows what I did—who I am. The asteroid guy. The deflection expert who couldn't deflect anything." He laughed bitterly. "I can't walk through the transit system without seeing it in people's faces. *There's the one who almost had the answer. Almost.*"

"No one thinks that."

"Everyone thinks that. I think that." He set down the tea. "The dissertation was supposed to save people, Mom. Four years of research on how to deflect asteroids. How to protect Earth. I was going to be important. Useful. I was going to matter."

"You do matter."

"Not the way I meant to. Not in any way that helps." He gestured at the empty apartment. "So I can't stay here. Can't keep drowning in what I'm not. Maybe somewhere else... maybe I can figure out how to be something different. How to live fifteen years when fifteen years is all there is."

Elena was quiet. When she spoke, her voice was thick. "I'm going to miss you terribly."

"I know. I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry for living your life. Even if—especially if—you only have thirteen and a half years left." She wiped her eyes quickly, professional mask slipping back. "Where will you go first?"

"Tokyo. There's a group there. Philosophical seekers—people trying to answer the same questions. How to live the end. How to make meaning without future. Buddhist, Stoic, Existentialist, everything mixed together." He'd found them online three months ago, spent hours reading their discussions. They seemed as lost as he was, but at least they were lost together. "After that... I don't know. Mumbai maybe. Lagos. Wherever seems right."

"Running toward or running from?"

"Yes." He smiled slightly. "Both. Either. Does it matter?"

"It might. Running from something never works. You take yourself with you. But running toward..." She considered. "That might be different. That might be seeking."

"What's the difference?"

"Intent. Purpose. One is avoidance. The other is search." Elena pulled out a small package, handed it to him. "I wrote you something. Letters. One for each month. Don't read them all at once—pace yourself. Just... when you're feeling lost, read one. Think of it as me being there with you."

Kenji held the package carefully. Thirteen letters from his mother. One for each month he'd be gone—if he came back at all. "Thank you."

"And this." She pulled out a credit chip. "Unlimited access to my personal account. I know you don't need it—you have your own funding. But take it anyway. So you never have to worry about resources. So you can go anywhere, do anything, come home anytime."

"Mom—"

"Please. Let me do this one thing." Her voice cracked. "Let me know my son can eat and sleep and travel safely. That's all I'm asking."

He took the chip. "Okay."

"When are you leaving?"

"Tomorrow morning. Six AM transport to Tokyo."

Elena nodded. Quiet for a long moment. Then: "I need to tell you something. About the election."

Kenji had almost forgotten. His mother's first term ended in three months. Election scheduled for Year 2, Month 9. People assumed she'd step down or elections would be canceled. She'd insisted on democratic process: "If we abandon democracy, we abandon everything."

"Marcus Rivera is running against me," Elena said. "Do you know him?"

"Infrastructure specialist. Thirty-two. Competent." Kenji had met him once at a government function. Sharp, earnest, younger than most senior staff.

"He's good. His platform is basically: stop pretending, accept reality, make people comfortable, let them leave. End symbolic governance." She smiled sadly. "He's not wrong. Governance is mostly symbolic now. I hold briefings for five people. Sign authorizations no one enforces. Maintain order that barely matters."

"Then why keep doing it?"

"Because someone should show up. Someone should say: we tried, we cared, we didn't abandon each other at the end." Elena met his eyes. "That's what I'm running on. Witness. Presence. Dignity. Not survival—I can't offer that. Just: someone showing up until the end."

"Will you win?"

"I don't know. Maybe. Rivera's younger, pragmatic, fresh. I'm exhausted and offering nothing concrete. But the people who stay—who don't leave Antarctica—maybe they want someone who shows up. Maybe that matters to them." She paused. "I need you to know: I might lose. And if I do, that's fine. That's democracy. But if I win... I'll be governing for another four years. Until Year 6. Then there's supposed to be another election."

"Will there be?"

"I don't know. Who'll bother running? Who'll bother voting when there's nine years left?" She shook her head. "But that's later. Right now: you should know I might lose. Your mother might not be mayor anymore."

"You'll always be mayor," Kenji said. "That's who you are. Election or no election."

"I'm also your mother. That's more important."

They sat together until the tea was gone and the honey cakes were eaten and the sky began its slow Antarctic dawn. Elena told him about the campaign—the debates, the questions, the core philosophical divide between her and Rivera. Both valid. Both honest. Different ways of facing the same ending.

Kenji told her about the seekers' community he'd be joining. The discussions they had online. The questions they wrestled with. No answers yet, but the questions felt important. *How do you live fifteen years? What matters when nothing lasts? Can there be meaning without permanence?*

"I wish I could answer those for you," Elena said.

"If you could, I wouldn't need to go."

"True."

When she left, Elena hugged him tightly. "Come home when you're ready. Or don't. Just stay alive. Please. That's all I ask."

"I'll try."

"Trying is enough."

After she was gone, Kenji sat alone in the empty apartment. His bags were packed. Transport booked. Thirteen months of funding secured. Letters from his mother in his pocket. Tomorrow he'd leave the only home he'd known since childhood.

He wasn't sure if he was brave or cowardly. Running toward seeking or running from failure. Maybe both. Maybe it didn't matter. The dissertation was deleted. The PhD was abandoned. The future he'd imagined was gone. This was something different. This was: find out how to live when there's no future to plan for.

He pulled out his personal screen, opened the seekers' forum one last time. Posted: *Arriving Tokyo tomorrow. Looking forward to meeting you all. Maybe together we can find what alone seems impossible.*

Responses came quickly. Welcome. See you soon. Bring questions—we have plenty. No answers yet, but we're working on it.

That felt right. No answers. Just work. Just seeking. Just people trying to figure out the same impossible thing together.

Kenji walked to the window. Looked out at Antarctica one last time. Three billion people down there. Including his mother, who'd govern them whether she won the election or not because that's what she did. Including Marcus, who'd run against her honestly because he had different answers. Including everyone trying to live normally in the waiting room of extinction.

He couldn't stay. Couldn't be part of that waiting. Needed motion. Needed distance. Needed to find something he couldn't even name yet.

The apartment was empty. His life was packed. Tomorrow he'd leave.

Tonight he sat in the dark and felt: fear, hope, guilt, relief. All tangled together. All real. All part of the thirteen and a half years he had left.

Outside, the city lights flickered. Inside, Kenji sat in emptiness. Between them: the window. The boundary. The crossing he'd make at dawn.

---

The transport station was crowded despite the early hour. Hundreds of people departing Antarctica—some for good, some for visits, all for their own reasons. The city had been hemorrhaging population since detection. Four billion to three billion in eighteen months. Everyone going somewhere else. Anywhere else.

Kenji checked in at the Tokyo gate. The attendant barely looked at him—just scanned his documentation, assigned his pod, moved to the next person. Anonymous. Perfect.

He'd been recognized constantly in Antarctica. The mayor's son. The dissertation candidate who'd specialized in the exact thing that failed. The poster child for futile expertise. Here in the crowd, he was no one. Just another traveler. Another person leaving.

The departure hall had floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the ice shelf. Kenji stood there while waiting for boarding, watching the Antarctic landscape stretch endlessly. He'd been born here. Grown up here. Spent twenty-five years on this continent without ever leaving. It was home.

Home that felt like a trap.

"First time off the ice?"

Kenji turned. A woman about his age, packing light like him. Dark skin, kind eyes, tired smile.

"That obvious?"

"You're staring at the ice like it's the last time you'll see it. Either first departure or final departure." She held out her hand. "Amira. Heading to Lagos."

"Kenji. Tokyo."

"Running from or running toward?"

He laughed. His mother had asked the same thing. "Why does everyone ask that?"

"Because everyone's doing one or the other. I'm running toward—my family's in Lagos. Want to spend the time left with them instead of in the megacity." She paused. "You?"

"Both. Either. Mostly... I need to not be here."

"That's honest." Amira looked out at the ice. "It's strange, isn't it? We spent a thousand years accepting we'd never leave Earth. Forever Earth. This is home. Then: asteroid. Suddenly home is temporary. Suddenly everywhere is temporary. Makes you wonder what home even means."

"Does it matter what it means if it ends anyway?"

"Maybe that's when it matters most." Amira shifted her bag. "My grandmother says: everything is home because nothing is home. Everywhere temporary, so everywhere equal. That's freedom, she says. Freedom to be anywhere in the time left."

"Wise grandmother."

"Hundred and eight years old. Lived through the climate shifts, the Antarctica migration, Forever Earth acceptance. Now: this. She's tired but still wise." Amira smiled. "She told me: go home to family. That's what matters. Not place. People."

The boarding announcement interrupted them. Tokyo gate on the left. Lagos gate on the right. They'd part here.

"Safe travels, Kenji running-from-and-toward."

"You too, Amira running-toward-family."

She laughed, headed to her gate. Kenji watched her go, then turned to his own. The Tokyo transport was sleek, automated, efficient. Pods for two hundred passengers. Half-full—most people weren't traveling to Tokyo, were traveling away from Antarctica to elsewhere.

Kenji found his pod, settled in. The space was small but comfortable. Window seat. He'd spend the next eight hours flying over the Pacific—the ocean he'd seen on maps but never in person. The world he'd studied but never experienced.

The transport lifted smoothly. Kenji watched through the window as Antarctica fell away. The megacity sprawling endlessly. The ice shelf extending beyond sight. The continent that had been his entire life shrinking to landscape, to concept, to memory.

He thought about his mother, probably in morning briefing right now. Five people around a table for fifty. Maintaining governance because someone should. Because witness mattered even when outcome didn't.

He thought about the dissertation. Four years of work. Two hundred seventy-three pages. Defense that would never happen. Dr. Torres who would never exist. All that future: gone.

He thought about the seekers waiting in Tokyo. People asking the same questions. How to live the end. How to make meaning. How to be present when presence was temporary.

No answers yet. Maybe no answers ever. But the questions felt important. Felt like purpose. Felt like something to move toward.

The transport climbed higher. The sky darkened to that perfect blue-black of high altitude. Kenji could see the curve of the Earth now—the planet that had trapped humanity for a thousand years. Forever Earth. The prison and paradise. Home that was temporary too.

In thirteen and a half years, it would all be gone. The ice. The city. His mother. The seekers. Everyone. Everything. Vaporized by physics and cosmic indifference.

But right now: sunrise over the Pacific. The ocean catching light. The world still here, still beautiful, still temporary.

Kenji pulled out his mother's first letter. The envelope said: *Month 1 - For when you arrive somewhere new.*

He opened it carefully.

*Mijo,*

*You've arrived. Wherever you are, whatever you're seeking, you've taken the first step. That's brave. That's important. That's living instead of waiting.*

*I want to tell you I'm proud. Not because you're solving anything. Not because you're finding answers. Because you're trying. Because you refused to accept paralysis. Because you chose motion over stagnation.*

*That's what I'm doing here too. Governing not because it saves anyone. Because motion is practice. Seeking is practice. Showing up is practice. We're both practicing how to live fifteen years—me through governance, you through seeking. Different methods. Same question.*

*I don't know if I'll win the election. By the time you read this, I might know. Or might not—it's Month 9, might still be campaigning. But win or lose: I'll keep showing up. Because that's my practice. That's how I live the end.*

*Your practice is seeking. So seek. Ask questions. Meet people. Experience the world you studied but never saw. Find what you're looking for. Or don't find it. Or find something different. All of that is valid. All of that is practice.*

*I miss you already. But I'm glad you left. Glad you're trying. Glad you're alive and seeking and refusing to wait for death.*

*That's enough. You're enough. The seeking is enough.*

*Love, Mom*

*P.S. - Eat properly. Sleep regularly. Comm me when you can. Those are still valid requests even during the apocalypse.*

Kenji read it twice. Folded it carefully. Put it in his journal where he'd keep all thirteen letters. Evidence that his mother was with him even when she wasn't. Evidence that practice mattered even without outcome.

The transport flew on. Below: Pacific Ocean, endless and indifferent. Ahead: Tokyo, first destination, first seeking. Beyond that: Mumbai, Lagos, Jerusalem, everywhere and nowhere.

Thirteen and a half years to seek. To find meaning or not find meaning. To practice living when living had an expiration date.

Kenji looked out at the curved horizon. The world was still here. Still beautiful. Still ending.

But not yet.

Not today.

Today: Tokyo. Today: seeking. Today: first step away from waiting toward something he couldn't name yet but needed to find.

The transport flew toward sunrise. Kenji flew with it. Leaving home. Seeking home. Understanding that maybe Amira's grandmother was right: everything is home because nothing is home.

In the meantime: questions. Motion. Practice.

That would have to be enough.
