# Chapter 14: Maintenance

**POV: David Chen | Year 3, Month 8**

---

Platform 73 greeted David with its familiar creak—metal expanding in the morning sun, two hundred meters above the ice. He clipped his safety harness to the rail and breathed the thin, cold air. 6:47 AM. Three minutes early, same as always.

"Morning, 47B."

The maintenance robot pivoted its sensor array toward him. *Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague Chen. Platform twelve requires recalibration. Connection housing integrity at eighty-two percent."

David smiled despite himself. The robot had been programmed to use his title—Colleague, not Worker or Unit. Someone in the AI ethics division, back when that division existed, had decided maintenance robots should treat humans as equals. Now David was one of twelve humans left in a division built for sixty, and 47B was the most reliable colleague he had.

"Let's take a look."

They moved together across the platform, David's boots finding purchase on the metal grating, 47B's treads humming softly. The solar array stretched in every direction—thousands of platforms, millions of panels, all tilting automatically to track the sun. In the distance, the Antarctic megacity sprawled across what used to be ice shelf, a continental hive of humanity trying to survive its countdown.

Eleven years, four months remaining.

David didn't think about it. Thinking didn't help.

Platform twelve's connection housing was exactly where it should be, degraded exactly as expected. David pulled the diagnostic tablet from his belt. Numbers confirmed what he already knew—the seals were failing, moisture getting in, conductivity dropping. Standard wear. Forty-seventh time he'd seen this particular failure mode.

"Replacement seals required," 47B reported.

"I know. Let's get the housing open."

They worked in comfortable silence. David positioning the extraction tool, 47B anticipating each next step, offering precisely the right component at precisely the right moment. They'd done this repair forty-six times together over the past two years. Perfect coordination. Almost like dancing.

Rodriguez used to joke about that. "You and that robot move better together than most married couples."

Rodriguez quit three weeks ago. Packed his tools, filed his resignation, said he was going to travel. See the world before it ended. "Come with me, Chen. This work doesn't matter anymore. The arrays will keep running without us. Automation handles everything."

David had stayed.

He tightened the final seal and ran the diagnostic. Green across the board. Connection housing integrity back to ninety-four percent. Good for another six months, maybe eight.

"Repair complete," 47B announced.

"Good work."

*Beep beep.*

The robot didn't need praise. Didn't need acknowledgment. But David gave it anyway, because what else did you do when someone—something—did good work?

They moved to the next repair. Platform eighteen, solar tracker misalignment. Then platform thirty-one, panel surface cleaning. Then platform seven, power coupling check. The morning passed in familiar rhythm. David's hands knew the motions. His mind could drift while his body maintained.

This was what he did. This was what he'd always done. Eight years maintaining these arrays, first as junior technician, then senior engineer, now—what? Last priest in an automated temple? The arrays barely needed humans anymore. The AI managed load balancing, predictive maintenance, emergency responses. Humans were backup systems for backup systems.

But David showed up. Every day. 6:47 AM. Because what else would he do?

By noon, they'd completed six repairs. David ate lunch on platform seventy-three—his platform, the one he'd claimed through repetition. Protein bar and thermos of tea. 47B entered low-power mode beside him, a companionable silence.

The megacity spread below. From two hundred meters up, you could see the patterns—the residential districts, the industrial zones, the green spaces engineered to provide oxygen and sanity. Four billion people down there. Used to be 4.2 billion. Numbers declining every month. Suicides, violence, despair, and the quiet decisions to stop fighting.

David didn't look at the numbers anymore. Numbers were Amara's domain.

He finished his tea and stood. "Ready?"

47B's sensor array brightened. *Beep beep.*

"Afternoon schedule: platforms forty-one through sixty. Routine inspection."

They worked. Platform after platform. Checking connections, cleaning surfaces, verifying alignment. Most platforms required nothing—just visual confirmation that automation was functioning. Human oversight for systems that didn't need overseeing.

Around 3 PM, David noticed movement on platform forty-seven. Another maintenance worker—Chen. No relation, different Chen. Infrastructure division, not solar. They exchanged nods across fifty meters of empty air.

How many Chens were left? David knew of three. Used to be dozens. Common name in a workforce that drew heavily from Pacific Rim populations. Now: three. Maybe fewer. People left, people quit, people ended it.

David kept working.

4:30 PM. Platform fifty-nine. David's tablet chimed—end of shift notification. He could go home.

He didn't go home.

Instead: the maintenance break room. Sublevel three of the array control building. Fluorescent lights, ancient coffee maker, lockers that used to have names but now just had numbers. David made tea—not from the coffee maker, he'd learned that lesson—using the kettle he kept in his locker.

The room was empty. Always empty now. Used to be crowded during shift changes. Thirty, forty people. Complaints about supervisors, jokes about robots, arguments about sports teams that didn't exist anymore. Now: echoes.

David sat at the long table and pulled out his tablet. Technical manuals. Solar array maintenance procedures, versions 1 through 47. He'd read them all multiple times. Read them again anyway. The words were familiar. Comforting. Precise.

Section 12.3: Connection Housing Replacement Protocols.

He'd just done that. Forty-seventh time. The manual described it perfectly—step by step, exactly as he'd performed it. Validation through repetition. Proof that he was doing it right, even though doing it right didn't matter anymore.

6:15 PM. The break room lights dimmed automatically—energy conservation. David made more tea. Read more manuals.

7:30 PM. His tablet chimed. Message from Amara: "Working late. Don't wait up."

David stared at the message. When was the last time he'd waited up? When was the last time she'd come home before midnight? When was the last time they'd spoken beyond logistics?

He couldn't remember.

He typed: "OK."

Sent it.

Deleted the conversation history because seeing months of "Working late" and "OK" was too honest.

8:45 PM. David finally stood. Cleaned his tea cup. Locked his tablet in his locker. Put on his jacket. Walked to the elevator.

The residential district was quiet. The megacity never truly slept, but it had rhythms—morning bustle, evening lull, midnight desperate energy. This was evening lull. People in their apartments, eating dinner, watching screens, being with family.

David walked the familiar route. Building seventeen, apartment 4C. Key card. Elevator. Fourth floor. Door.

The apartment was dark.

Of course it was dark. Amara was at the monitoring station. Always at the monitoring station. David turned on one light—kitchen, not bedroom. Made more tea, even though he'd had four cups already. Sat at the small table and looked at nothing.

When did this happen?

The thought arrived unbidden. When did we stop being married?

Not officially. They hadn't discussed separation, divorce, ending it. Just: stopped. Stopped talking beyond logistics. Stopped eating together. Stopped sleeping in the same bed—Amara on the couch when she came home, if she came home. Stopped touching. Stopped asking how the other's day went. Stopped caring.

When?

David tried to remember. Traced back. Year three, definitely distant. Year two, getting worse. Year one, after detection—that's when it broke. Amara retreating into data. David retreating into maintenance. Both of them choosing work over connection, choosing numbness over feeling, choosing isolation over the vulnerability of being together when everything was ending.

He should talk to her. Should say: this isn't working. Should say: I miss you. Should say: we have eleven years left, let's not spend them as strangers.

He didn't say anything.

Because what would change? She'd still choose data. He'd still choose maintenance. They'd still be two people who used to love each other, now sharing space out of inertia.

Easier not to talk about it. Easier to let it continue. Easier to maintain the fiction that they were still married, still partners, still something more than roommates waiting for the end.

David drank his tea. Looked at the dark apartment. Listened to the silence.

A memory surfaced, unbidden: Year minus seven. Solar energy conference in Singapore. He'd been presenting on tracker optimization algorithms—dry technical stuff, audience of twelve. Amara was there for the astrophysics panel. They'd ended up at the same networking reception, same table, same bottle of wine.

She'd asked about his work. Actually interested, not just polite. He'd asked about hers. Black holes, stellar formation, the physics of the impossible. Her eyes had lit up talking about it. He'd loved that—her brilliance made visible, her passion tangible.

They'd talked for four hours. Missed the rest of the conference. Got coffee the next morning. Exchanged contact information. Started messaging. Six months later: dating. Year minus five: married.

She'd been brilliant and passionate and alive. He'd been steady and reliable and present. Good combination. They'd balanced each other. He grounded her flights of theory. She expanded his practical focus. It worked.

Then Year zero. Detection. The asteroid. And Amara's brilliance turned to burden—she'd found it, calculated it, confirmed humanity's death. Her work became guilt and responsibility and numbness. She retreated into data because feeling was impossible.

David understood. Intellectually, he understood. Your work ending the world—how do you process that? How do you stay human?

But understanding didn't bridge the gap. Understanding didn't make her talk to him, touch him, see him. Understanding didn't save the marriage.

Maybe marriages weren't supposed to survive apocalypse. Maybe asking for connection while everything ended was too much. Maybe they'd each chosen their own survival method—her numbness, his maintenance—and those methods didn't include each other anymore.

David finished his tea. Washed the cup. Put it away. Went to the bedroom.

The bed was made—housekeeping automation. Amara's side looked untouched. Probably was untouched. She slept at the monitoring station more often than not. Office couch, or maybe not sleeping at all. Just: calculating, updating, tracking the asteroid's perfect approach.

David lay down on his side. Looked at the empty space beside him.

Eleven years, four months left.

Should he spend them like this? Married to someone who wasn't present? Maintaining a relationship that was already over?

Probably not. Probably should talk to her. Probably should acknowledge the truth, file for divorce, go their separate ways for the remaining years.

Tomorrow. He'd think about it tomorrow.

But tomorrow he'd wake at 6:30 AM. Eat breakfast. Take the transport to the solar arrays. Clip his harness to platform seventy-three. Greet 47B. Start the day's repairs. Work until shift end. Go to the break room. Read manuals. Come home late. Eat alone. Sleep alone.

Same as today. Same as yesterday. Same as every day for three years.

Maintenance as meditation. Routine as meaning. Showing up as purpose.

Was it enough?

David didn't know. Didn't let himself ask. Because if it wasn't enough, then what?

He closed his eyes. Sleep came slowly, but it came.

---

The next morning: 6:30 AM. Alarm. Shower. Breakfast. Transport to the arrays.

Platform seventy-three. 6:47 AM. Three minutes early.

"Morning, 47B."

*Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague Chen. Platform eight requires recalibration. Connection housing integrity at eighty-one percent."

David smiled. Same greeting. Same reliability. Same comfortable partnership with a machine that never judged, never left, never asked for more than he could give.

"Let's take a look."

They moved across the platform together. The work began. Platform eight, connection housing. He'd done this repair forty-seven times.

Forty-eighth now.

The motion was automatic. Extraction tool, seal removal, housing inspection, moisture cleaning, new seals, reassembly, diagnostic check. Green across the board. Good for another six months.

"Repair complete," 47B announced.

"Good work."

*Beep beep.*

They moved to the next repair. And the next. And the next. The morning passed. Lunch on platform seventy-three. Afternoon inspections. Break room tea. Technical manuals. Home at 8:45 PM. Dark apartment. Tea. Bed. Sleep.

Repeat.

This was maintenance. This was David's life. This was how he spent Year three of humanity's countdown: showing up, fixing things that would break again, maintaining systems that would end anyway, partnering with a robot because robots didn't leave.

Was it enough?

He didn't ask.

Eleven years, four months left.

He'd spend them maintaining. Because that's what he did. Because work was better than feeling. Because routine was better than chaos. Because showing up was better than giving up.

Even if it meant spending those years alone.

Even if it meant his marriage was already over.

Even if it meant maintaining the fiction along with the solar arrays—keeping both running through repetition and denial and the simple act of showing up every morning at 6:47 AM.

Platform seventy-three.

*Beep beep.*

"Good morning, Colleague Chen."

Good morning, 47B.

Let's get to work.
