# Chapter 14 - Ibrahim

The prayer beads feel wrong in Ibrahim's hands.

Not Christian beads this time—his own. Muslim prayer beads. *Misbaha*. Ninety-nine beads for ninety-nine names of God. He's held them since he was a boy. Wore them in combat. Prayed with them after every raid.

Now they feel like stones. Heavy and meaningless.

Three years since the asteroid was detected. Three years since he prayed and felt nothing. Three years of fighting anyway, because what else was there?

Ibrahim sits in the militia camp outside Jerusalem. Around him, the holy land continues its ancient wars. Muslims fighting Christians fighting Jews fighting each other. Everyone convinced God is on their side. Everyone dying for sacred ground that will be vaporized in twelve years.

He should be preparing for tonight's raid. Should be checking his weapon, reviewing the target coordinates, praying for strength and righteousness.

Instead, he's staring at prayer beads and wondering why he's still here.

---

The imam comes by during evening prayers.

"Brother Ibrahim, you weren't at prayer."

"No, imam. I was... thinking."

The old man sits down—uninvited but not unwelcome. He's been the camp's spiritual leader for years. Blessed Ibrahim when he joined at sixteen. Buried three of Ibrahim's brothers-in-arms.

"Thinking is good. But prayer is also needed."

"Is it?" The words come out sharper than Ibrahim intended.

The imam is quiet for a moment. "You've been troubled since the detection."

"Haven't we all?"

"Many are troubled. But most still pray. Still believe. You... you go through motions. Your prayers are hollow. I can hear it in your voice."

Ibrahim should deny it. Should defend his faith. Should say of course he believes, of course he trusts in Allah's plan.

Instead, he says: "I don't know what I believe anymore."

The admission hangs in the air between them.

"That is natural," the imam says carefully. "When faced with catastrophe, faith is tested. But this is the test, Ibrahim. This is when faith matters most. When the world seems to make no sense, that's when we must trust in Allah's wisdom."

"What wisdom? We're all going to die. Muslims, Christians, Jews, atheists. Everyone. The land we're fighting for will be destroyed. The mosques, the churches, the temples—all gone. If this is Allah's plan, what's the point? What's the purpose?"

"We cannot understand Allah's purpose with our limited minds—"

"Then what use is faith?" Ibrahim hears the anger in his own voice. "If we can't understand, if we just accept everything as Allah's will, then what are we? Just puppets going through motions until we die?"

The imam's face hardens. "Careful, brother. These are dangerous thoughts."

"Dangerous to whom? We're dying anyway. What can God do to me that the asteroid won't?"

"Curse you with a faithless death. Deny you paradise."

Ibrahim looks at the old man. Sees genuine concern. Genuine belief. The imam really thinks paradise awaits. Really believes the righteous will be rewarded, the martyrs honored.

Ibrahim used to believe that too.

"I'm sorry, imam. I didn't mean to offend."

"You're troubled. I understand. But Ibrahim—don't let the asteroid steal your faith. That's a death before death." The imam stands. "I'll pray for you."

He walks away, leaving Ibrahim alone with his prayer beads and his doubt.

---

The raid goes badly.

Not catastrophic—no one on their side dies. But the target was already abandoned. They break into the Christian militia's supposed supply depot and find it empty. Wasted effort. Wasted risk.

On the way back, they hit a UN checkpoint. The peacekeepers—exhausted, understaffed, barely maintaining presence—just wave them through. No inspection. No confiscation. What's the point?

Everyone knows the world is ending. The UN is maintaining order out of habit, not hope.

Just like Ibrahim is fighting out of habit, not faith.

Back at camp, Ibrahim cleans his weapon mechanically. Around him, others are debriefing, planning the next raid, arguing about tactics.

He tunes them out.

A voice interrupts his thoughts. "You look like you're cleaning that gun for a funeral."

Ibrahim looks up. A young man stands nearby—mid-twenties, mixed ethnicity, not from the camp. A visitor.

"Who are you?"

"Kenji Torres. I'm staying at the refugee camp down the road. Watching. Trying to understand what's happening here."

"You picked a strange time to visit Jerusalem. Wars are getting worse."

"I noticed." Kenji sits down—again, uninvited but somehow not intrusive. "But I'm not here for the war. I'm here trying to understand how people find meaning. You're fighting for holy land that'll be destroyed. Why?"

Most people would be offended by the question. Ibrahim just feels tired.

"Because it's what I do. Who I am. I've been a fighter since I was sixteen. Don't know how to be anything else."

"Do you believe in what you're fighting for?"

Ibrahim should say yes. Should defend the cause, the faith, the struggle.

Instead, he says: "I used to. Before the asteroid, I believed completely. Knew God was watching. Knew martyrdom led to paradise. Knew fighting was righteous." He sets down the gun. "Now I don't know. God isn't watching. Or He's watching and doesn't care. Or He doesn't exist. I don't know which is worse."

Kenji is quiet for a moment. Then: "I've been traveling for three years. Asking questions like yours. Trying to find people who have answers. Want to know what I learned?"

"What?"

"No one has answers. Everyone's making it up. The Buddhists say let go of attachment. The Christians say have faith. The humanists say create meaning yourself. Everyone has a different story. None of them can be proven." He looks at Ibrahim. "But maybe that's okay. Maybe we choose what matters. Maybe meaning isn't given by God or found in holy land. Maybe we decide."

"Without God, how do you decide?"

"I'm still figuring that out. But I think it has to do with being present. With loving what's here while it's here. With accepting impermanence instead of fighting it."

Ibrahim thinks about this. About three years of fighting with eroding faith. About praying and feeling nothing. About killing men who believed they were righteous, just like he believed he was righteous.

"If I'm not a fighter," he says slowly, "who am I?"

"I don't know. But you have twelve years to figure it out."

---

Kenji stays at the refugee camp for two months.

He and Ibrahim meet often. Walk through the city ruins together. Talk about faith and doubt, meaning and meaninglessness, how to live when the end is certain.

They're unlikely friends. Kenji, the seeker from Antarctica, philosopher-in-training. Ibrahim, the fighter from Palestine, faith-in-crisis.

But they understand each other.

Both searching. Both adrift. Both trying to figure out how to be human when nothing makes sense anymore.

One evening, they're sitting on rubble overlooking the old city. Jerusalem stretches below them—ancient and contested, beautiful and broken. Twelve years until it's dust.

"Do you ever wish you could just believe again?" Ibrahim asks. "Like the imam. Like my brothers in the camp. They have certainty. Even if it's false, it's something."

"I tried that," Kenji says. "Tried forcing faith. Went to temples, churches, mosques. Listened to every teacher. Tried to believe in something, anything. Didn't work. Can't force faith. Either it's there or it isn't."

"So what do you do without it?"

"Live anyway. Choose what matters. Love people. Be present. It's harder without certainty. No cosmic meaning, no divine plan, no afterlife promise. Just: this moment, this breath, this conversation. That's all we know we have."

Ibrahim picks up a piece of rubble. Ancient stone. Maybe from a temple. Maybe from a house. Impossible to tell now.

"I've killed men," he says quietly. "Christians mostly. Some Jews. Killed them believing I was righteous. Believing God approved. Believing martyrs went to paradise and enemies went to hell." He drops the stone. "What if there's no paradise? What if I killed them for nothing?"

"You killed them for faith. That faith turned out to be false, or at least unprovable. But you weren't lying to yourself. You genuinely believed."

"Does that make it better or worse?"

"I don't know. But carrying guilt forever won't help. You can't undo what you did. You can only decide who to be going forward."

"Who do I be if I'm not a fighter?"

"That's what the next twelve years are for."

They sit in silence, watching the sun set over the holy land. Tomorrow, Ibrahim will go on another raid. Will continue fighting because it's what he knows.

But something is shifting.

The certainty is gone. The faith is broken.

Maybe that's okay.

Maybe he can figure out what comes next.

Three months after meeting Kenji, Ibrahim kills another man.

Christian militia fighter. Close combat in a ruined building. The man fights well, trained, experienced. They grapple. Ibrahim's knife finds his throat.

The man falls. Dies quickly.

Ibrahim searches the body—standard procedure. Finds a medallion. Prayer beads. A photograph of children.

The man was a father. A believer. A fighter like Ibrahim.

Thought he was righteous. Thought God was watching. Thought the struggle mattered.

Now he's dead. His children are orphans. His faith doesn't matter. His righteousness doesn't matter.

In twelve years, his children will die too. Everything he fought for: ash.

Ibrahim sits beside the body and vomits.

Not from the violence—he's seen violence. From the meaninglessness. From the absolute waste of it all.

This man died for nothing. Ibrahim killed him for nothing. They're fighting over land that will be destroyed. Following faiths that promise rewards that won't come.

Everything is nothing.

Ibrahim stumbles out of the building. His unit is already moving to the next target. He follows mechanically.

But he's done.

Not done fighting yet—he doesn't know how to stop. But done believing it matters.

Done pretending God is watching.

Done being certain.

---

Kenji leaves a week later.

"I'm going back to Lagos," he says. "Going to study with a philosopher there. Professor Wei. She's ancient, wise, has tools for living with impermanence. Want to come?"

Ibrahim almost says yes.

Almost leaves the militia, leaves the holy land, leaves the fighting behind.

But he's not ready. Not yet.

"I can't. This is all I know. I have to—I have to figure out how to stop being a fighter before I can be something else."

Kenji nods. "I understand. But Ibrahim—don't waste the time. Don't fight for another twelve years out of habit. You know it's meaningless now. Find what isn't."

"How?"

"I don't know. But you're questioning. That's the start. Most people can't even do that. They cling to certainty even when it's obviously false. You let go. That's brave."

They embrace—brothers-in-crisis, friends-in-doubt.

"Will I see you again?" Ibrahim asks.

"Maybe. I'll be in Lagos for a while. Then back to Antarctica eventually. If you make it there, find me."

"I will."

Kenji leaves. Ibrahim watches him go.

Then Ibrahim returns to the militia camp. Returns to the fighting. Returns to the war.

But something has changed.

The prayer beads sit in his pocket, untouched.

The certainty is gone.

The faith is broken.

And Ibrahim—for the first time since he was sixteen years old—doesn't know what comes next.

But he's starting to think that's okay.

That not knowing might be more honest than false certainty.

That doubt might be more human than faith.

That maybe, just maybe, he can figure out how to be someone other than a fighter.

Twelve years left.

Then eleven years, nine months.

Then eleven years, eight months.

The countdown continues.

Ibrahim continues with it.

But he's questioning now.

And questions, he's learning, might be more valuable than answers.

---

Six months after Kenji leaves, Ibrahim is preparing for another raid when he stops.

Just: stops.

His unit is gearing up. The imam is blessing them. Everyone is following the routine they've followed hundreds of times.

Ibrahim sets down his weapon.

"Brother Ibrahim?" someone asks.

"I'm done."

"Done with what?"

"Fighting. This. All of it."

The camp goes quiet. The commander stares at him. "You're abandoning jihad?"

"Jihad for what? For land that will be destroyed? For God who isn't watching? For certainty I don't have anymore?" Ibrahim stands. "I'm done. I don't know what I'll do instead. But I can't kill anymore for something I don't believe in."

"You'll be cast out."

"I know."

"You'll have nothing."

"I have questions. That's more than I had yesterday."

He walks away from the camp. From the fighting. From three years of doubt and seven years before that of false certainty.

He has no plan. No destination. No faith.

Just questions.

Just doubt.

Just the willingness to figure out what comes next.

He thinks of Kenji's words: *You have twelve years to figure it out.*

Eleven years left now. Plenty of time.

Ibrahim walks away from the holy land.

Toward something else.

Toward uncertainty.

Toward whatever it means to be human without certainty.

He's terrified.

He's free.

Both at once.
