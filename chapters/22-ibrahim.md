# Chapter 22: Ibrahim

The bullet doesn't hit Ibrahim. The shrapnel does.

Year 8, Jerusalem, contested ground that's been contested for three thousand years and will be contested for seven more. Ibrahim al-Rashid crouches behind rubble that used to be someone's home, automatic rifle in his hands, and thinks: *what are we fighting for?*

Everyone's dying anyway.

The mortar hits twenty meters away. The blast throws him sideways. Something hot tears through his left leg. He falls, hits the ground, sees blood spreading dark across his combat fatigues.

Too much blood.

The pain comes seconds later—white-hot, overwhelming, real in a way nothing has felt real for years. He tries to stand. His leg won't hold. He falls again, hands in the blood, the dust, the rubble of someone's home.

Around him, the battle continues. His unit fighting. The other side fighting. Everyone fighting for holy land that will be vapor in seven years.

Ibrahim lies in the blood and the dust and thinks: *I don't want to die for this.*

But he's dying anyway.

His vision grays. The sounds fade. Someone's shouting his name—Rashid, another fighter, trying to reach him. But there's gunfire between them, and Rashid drops behind cover, and Ibrahim's alone in the contested street, bleeding out on the holy ground he's defended for five years.

He thinks of his father, praying five times daily with mechanical devotion. Thinks of his mother, fasting for Ramadan even as the world ends. Thinks of Kenji, the seeker he met Year 3, who asked: "Do you really believe God wants this?"

Ibrahim doesn't know anymore.

Doesn't think he's believed for years.

Just: fought because he's a fighter. Because without fighting, he's nothing.

Now he's nothing anyway.

His vision darkens further. The pain becomes distant. He thinks: *at least I'll die in the holy lands. At least that.*

Then: hands grabbing him. Voices shouting medical terms he doesn't understand. The roar of a UN evacuation transport. Someone saying, "Hang on, hang on, you're going to make it."

Ibrahim wants to tell them: don't bother. Let me die here. This is where I'm supposed to die.

But his voice won't work.

And the darkness takes him.

---

He wakes in white.

White walls. White ceiling. White sheets. Everything white and clean and wrong.

His leg is fire. His whole body is fire. But he's alive—breathing, hurting, alive.

A voice beside him: "You're awake. Good. Don't try to move."

Ibrahim turns his head. A doctor—young, exhausted, efficient. Behind her, through a window: ice. Endless ice and architecture rising from it.

"Where—" His voice is gravel.

"McMurdo District, Antarctica. UN medical facility. You were evacuated from Jerusalem. Critical condition. You're stable now."

Antarctica. The other side of the world. The megacity. Not the holy lands.

"My leg—"

"Severely damaged. We saved it, but you'll walk with a limp. Combat capability: minimal. You won't be returning to active duty."

Won't be fighting.

Won't be a fighter.

The words land like stones. Ibrahim closes his eyes.

"Your unit is trying to reach your family," the doctor continues. "Communication with the Middle East is spotty, but we're trying. Meanwhile, you'll stay here for recovery. Six weeks minimum."

She leaves. Ibrahim lies in the white bed, staring at the white ceiling, feeling the fire in his leg and the emptiness everywhere else.

He was a fighter.

Now he's nothing.

---

Days blur together. Physical therapy. Pain medication. Learning to walk again—first with full support, then crutches, then a cane, always with the limp, always with the weakness. His left leg: damaged, permanent, ending everything he was.

The hospital has forty beds. Thirty are occupied—fighters from various conflicts, all evacuated here, all damaged in ways that end their fighting. They don't talk much. What would they say?

Ibrahim sits by the window, watching Antarctica function. Even now, Year 8, seven years until impact, the megacity maintains itself. Districts operating. Transport systems running. People going to work, coming home, living as if tomorrow exists.

It's orderly. Efficient. Almost peaceful.

Everything he fought for will end anyway.

This will all be vapor.

The holy lands will be vapor.

The wars will be meaningless.

Were always meaningless.

The thought breaks something in him.

One morning, he's sitting by the window when a woman enters the ward. Not a doctor—she's dressed too formally. Older, maybe sixty, moving with exhausted authority. She stops at each bed, talking quietly with the wounded fighters.

When she reaches Ibrahim, she sits in the chair beside him. "I'm Elena Torres. Mayor of Lagos District. I visit the medical facilities when I can. How are you doing?"

Ibrahim doesn't know how to answer that question. "I'm alive."

"That's something."

"Is it?"

She studies him with tired, kind eyes. "I don't know anymore. But you're here. I'm here. We keep going. What else is there?"

"I was a fighter," Ibrahim says. "Now I can't fight. So what am I?"

"That's for you to decide."

"Without God, how do I decide?"

Elena blinks, surprised. "You lost faith?"

"I lost everything. Faith, purpose, identity." He gestures at his leg. "This just made it visible."

Elena is quiet for a moment. Then: "My son lost faith too. Or never had it. He spent years seeking meaning—traveled the world, tried everything. Eventually learned to stop seeking. Started just being present."

"How?"

"He met a teacher. An old professor in Lagos. Buddhist philosopher. She taught him about impermanence, acceptance, presence. She died Year 12. But her teachings... they helped him."

"I don't want more teachings," Ibrahim says. "I spent my whole life following teachings. Quran, hadith, imam's guidance. It led me to killing for holy land that's going to be dust. I'm done with teachings."

"That's fair," Elena says. "But there's a difference between dogma and wisdom. Dogma tells you what to believe. Wisdom helps you see what's true."

"What's true?"

"That we're all dying. That meaning isn't given—it's made. That you get to choose what matters now." She stands, preparing to move to the next bed. "My son is here in Antarctica. His name is Kenji Torres. If you want to talk to someone who's faced what you're facing, I can introduce you."

"Maybe," Ibrahim says. "I don't know."

"That's okay. Not knowing is honest."

She leaves. Ibrahim sits by the window, watching the orderly city, the functioning systems, the people pretending tomorrow exists.

Not knowing is honest.

He hasn't been honest in years.

---

That night, lying in the dark ward, surrounded by wounded fighters, Ibrahim cries.

Not silently. Not controlled. He cries like something breaking—deep, wrenching sobs that hurt his healing chest, that wake the other wounded fighters, that empty him of everything he's been holding.

He cries for the five years of fighting. For the people he killed. For the certainty he lost. For the God he can't believe in anymore. For his parents who are strangers now. For his siblings he might never see again. For the holy lands that are just land, just earth, temporary as everything.

For the boy he was at twenty, praying in the mosque, believing absolutely, certain of God and righteousness and meaning.

That boy is dead.

Ibrahim killed him slowly over five years.

And now: nothing left but the wound and the limp and the question: what now?

He cries for hours. Eventually sleeps. Dreams of Jerusalem—but not the contested streets, not the battles. Just: the city itself. Ancient stones. Old prayers. History layered on history layered on history, all of it ending in seven years.

Was any of it worth it?

He doesn't know.

Doesn't have to know.

Maybe that's the beginning.

---

Six weeks later, Ibrahim walks out of the hospital. Still limping. Still in pain. But mobile. Alive. Cleared for discharge.

He has nowhere to go.

The UN provides refugee housing—small apartments for displaced persons, people who fled chaos and ended up in Antarctica. Ibrahim moves into a fourth-floor unit, one room, shared bathroom, functional. The window looks out on the ice shelf and the solar arrays stretching endlessly, maintaining power for a dying civilization.

He has no job. No purpose. No faith. No identity.

Just: time. Seven years of it, minus however long until the world infrastructure collapses completely.

He spends the first week doing nothing. Sitting at the window. Eating when hungry. Sleeping when tired. Existing without meaning, without structure, without knowing what comes next.

It's the most honest he's been in years.

The second week, he starts walking. His leg hurts, but the physical therapist said walking helps. He explores McMurdo District—the residential sectors, the commercial zones, the public spaces. Everything still functioning, but with gaps. Shops closed. Buildings empty. Population down to maybe two million from what must have been five or ten million at peak.

But still: people. Still: life. Still: going through motions because what else would they do?

He finds religious spaces—mosques, churches, temples, meditation centers. He sits in them. Listens. Doesn't pray. Can't pray. The words are hollow now, the rituals empty.

But he listens.

The third week, someone sits beside him in the mosque. Ibrahim's in the back row, watching others pray, not participating. The man who sits down is young—maybe Ibrahim's age, mixed Asian features, calm presence.

"You're not praying," the man observes. Not accusing. Just noticing.

"No," Ibrahim says.

"But you're here."

"Yes."

"Me too." The man smiles slightly. "I'm Kenji. Elena Torres is my mother. She mentioned meeting you in the hospital."

Ibrahim remembers. The mayor. Her son, the seeker who stopped seeking.

"Ibrahim," he says.

"I know. Want to walk? I find it easier to talk while moving."

They walk through McMurdo District—two wounded men, one limping physically, one limping spiritually, both trying to figure out how to exist without the structures they used to rely on.

"My mom said you lost faith," Kenji says.

"Completely."

"How does that feel?"

Ibrahim considers. "Terrifying. Liberating. Empty. Full. I don't know. All of it."

"Yeah," Kenji says. "I never had faith to lose. But I spent years seeking something to replace it. Tried hedonism, tried philosophy, tried different spiritual paths. None of them fit. Eventually learned from a teacher—Professor Wei, she's gone now—that the seeking itself was the problem. That presence matters more than certainty."

"How do you be present when everything is ending?"

"That's the only time you *can* be present. When you know time is limited, presence becomes possible. Before, we could pretend we had forever. Now we can't. So we have to actually be here."

They walk in silence. The ice shelf stretches around them. The solar arrays hum. The sun circles the horizon—Antarctic summer, light without end.

"I met you before," Ibrahim says suddenly. "Year 3. Jerusalem. You were in a refugee camp, watching the fighting."

Kenji stops walking. "That was you? The fighter who talked to me about faith and doubt?"

"Yes."

"You said you'd found certainty and then lost it. You said you didn't know what you were doing anymore."

"Still don't," Ibrahim says. "But at least now I'm honest about it."

Kenji smiles—genuine, warm. "That's everything, actually. Honesty is everything."

They walk for an hour. Kenji tells him about Professor Wei, about the gardenia that bloomed and died, about learning impermanence, about returning to Antarctica to be with his mother for the remaining years. About finding peace not in answers but in questions asked gently.

Ibrahim listens. Doesn't agree with everything. Doesn't disagree either. Just: listens.

When they part, Kenji says, "I'm here if you want to talk. No pressure. But... I understand what you're going through. Different paths, but similar territory."

"Thank you," Ibrahim says.

He walks back to his refugee apartment. Climbs the four flights—his leg screaming by the end. Sits at the window, watching the sun not set.

Seven years left.

No faith. No identity. No certainty.

Just: himself. Ibrahim al-Rashid. 27 years old. Wounded fighter. Lost believer. Honest at last.

What comes next?

He doesn't know.

Doesn't have to know.

Maybe that's the beginning of wisdom.

Maybe not knowing is enough.

He falls asleep in the chair, sun streaming through the window, leg aching, heart empty and somehow—strangely, impossibly—lighter than it's been in years.

The wound took his fighting.

But maybe it gave him something else.

Maybe it gave him a chance to start over.

To choose what matters.

To be present for the seven years remaining.

To live without certainty.

To be honest.

To be.

Outside, Antarctica functions. Inside, Ibrahim breathes. Tomorrow he'll wake up and still not know what comes next.

And that—impossibly—is okay.

For now, it's enough.

It has to be.

Seven years.

Seven years to figure out what he is without fighting, without God, without certainty.

Seven years to be present.

Seven years to be honest.

Seven years to just: be.

The sun circles endlessly.

Ibrahim sleeps.

And for the first time in years, he doesn't dream of war.

He dreams of nothing.

It's peaceful.
