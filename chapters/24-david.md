# Chapter 24: David

David Chen is calibrating platform seventy-three when Amara appears on the maintenance deck.

He doesn't notice her at first—too focused on the connection housing, checking voltage regularity, updating the log. The arrays need maintenance. They always need maintenance. That's what he does. That's all he does.

"David."

He freezes. Turns slowly. Amara stands at the deck railing, two hundred meters above the ice shelf, wearing the thermal coat she never wears, looking uncomfortable at this height, looking at him.

Year 10. Five years until impact. They've been married twelve years. Strangers for the last decade.

"Amara." His voice sounds rusty. When did they last talk? Really talk, not just logistics about the apartment or brief messages about schedules. "What are you doing up here?"

"Looking for you."

"I'm working."

"I know. You're always working." She moves closer—carefully, not comfortable on the platform. "Can we talk?"

"I'm in the middle of—"

"Please."

Something in her voice stops him. Not desperation exactly. Not demand. Just: truth. She needs to talk. Needs him to listen.

David sets down his tools. "Okay."

They stand on the platform, wind whipping around them, solar panels stretching in perfect rows, the sun circling the horizon in endless Antarctic day. Below, the megacity functions. Above, nothing but sky and the asteroid coming.

"We wasted ten years," Amara says.

The words land like stones. Direct. Undeniable.

"I know," David says quietly.

"I wasted them in the monitoring facility, tracking calculations that don't matter. You wasted them here, maintaining arrays for no one. We both just... hid. From each other. From everything."

"Yes."

"And I don't want to waste five more." Amara's voice cracks. "I don't want to die estranged. I don't want our marriage to end like this—two ghosts in the same apartment, polite and distant and dead already."

David looks at his wife. Really looks. She's fifty years old. Gaunt. Exhausted. Older than she should be. But still: Amara. Still the woman he fell in love with fifteen years ago, the scientist who saw patterns in chaos, the brilliant mind that matched his, the person he chose to build a life with.

Before the life ended.

Before they stopped trying.

"What are you saying?" he asks.

"I'm saying I'm sorry. I'm saying I was wrong to hide in work. I'm saying you deserve better than a ghost for a wife. I'm saying..." She breathes deeply. "I'm saying I love you. Still. Maybe always. And I want to try. For five years. I want to actually be married instead of just cohabiting. I want to know you again. I want—"

Her voice breaks. She wipes her eyes quickly, frustrated with herself.

David doesn't know what to say. For ten years, he's functioned. Maintained arrays. Worked alongside robots who don't need meaning. He's forgotten how to connect. How to reach for someone. How to be anything except mechanical.

But standing on the platform, wind cold, Amara crying, five years stretching ahead—he realizes something: he doesn't want to die alone either.

Doesn't want to die estranged.

Doesn't want their marriage to end as ghosts.

"Okay," he says.

"Okay?"

"Let's try."

Amara stares at him. "Just like that?"

"Not just like that. It's... I've been thinking about it too. About us. About how we're wasting what's left." He gestures at the arrays. "The robots are better at this than I am. They don't need me. But you... maybe you need me. Maybe I need you."

"I do need you," Amara says. "I need us."

David moves closer—awkward, uncertain. He hasn't touched his wife in years. Doesn't remember how. But he reaches out, takes her hand.

She squeezes back. Hard. Holding on.

They stand there, two hundred meters up, holding hands like teenagers, like the beginning, like before everything fell apart.

"I don't know how to do this," David says. "I don't know how to be... not mechanical."

"Neither do I. But we figure it out. Together. One day at a time."

"One day at a time," he echoes.

Below, the robots continue maintenance. Above, the sky circles. On the platform, two people who used to be married start trying to be married again.

It's not fixed. Not healed. Not easy.

But it's beginning.

And beginning is enough.

---

They start with coffee.

David comes home after his shift—actually comes home at reasonable hour, doesn't extend into sixteen-hour marathons. Amara makes coffee—real coffee, synthesized but decent. They sit at the kitchen table.

"How was your day?" Amara asks.

The question feels alien. When did they last ask each other that? Year 2? Year 3?

"Platform seventy-three needed recalibration," David says. "Voltage deviation. Fixed it."

"That's good."

Silence. Awkward, heavy.

"How was yours?" David asks.

"Empty. The monitoring facility is down to three people. We're tracking approach vectors that don't change. It's pointless. But I don't know what else to do."

"You could stop. Come work with me. The arrays need maintenance."

Amara considers. "Would that be better? Or just different pointless work?"

"At least we'd be doing pointless work together."

She smiles—small, genuine, first smile he's seen in years. "That's actually appealing."

They drink coffee. Talk haltingly. Stop. Start again. It's like learning a language they used to speak fluently, forgotten grammar, missing vocabulary.

But they keep trying.

The next morning, Amara joins him at the arrays. She's not trained for maintenance work, but she learns quickly—she's brilliant, always was. He shows her how to check connections, recalibrate sensors, update logs. They work side by side.

47B glides along its rail, sensor array rotating. *Query: additional human detected. Maintenance efficiency parameters adjusting.*

"This is 47B," David says. "My... colleague."

"You've mentioned it. The robot you talk to."

"Yeah."

Amara studies the robot. "Does it talk back?"

"Not really. But it listens better than humans."

"That's depressing."

"I know."

They work through the morning. Amara's good at it—precise, methodical, careful. She doesn't complain about the cold or the height or the meaninglessness. She just: works.

At lunch, they sit on the platform, eating synthesized protein bars, watching the ice shelf stretch endlessly.

"I talked to Zara yesterday," Amara says. "She wants to visit Year 15. Bring Kwame and the children. She wants us to meet them properly."

David nods. "I'd like that."

"Really?"

"I'd like to meet your family. I'd like to be part of your life again."

Amara leans against him—tentatively, testing if touch is allowed. David puts his arm around her. Awkward. Uncertain. But: connection.

They sit there for twenty minutes. Not talking. Just: being together.

It's the most present David's felt in a decade.

---

Week two of trying, they walk in the nature preserves.

Antarctica maintains them still—small zones of transplanted ecosystems, trees and grass and flowing water, maintained for beauty's sake even though beauty's ending. The preserves are mostly empty now. Occasional visitors, but not many. Most people have given up on beauty.

David and Amara walk the paths. She tells him about her work—ten years of tracking the asteroid, calculating impact vectors, searching for solutions that don't exist. The desperation. The futility. The slow realization that she was hiding.

"I couldn't face what was coming," she says. "If I kept working, kept calculating, I could pretend there was something to do. But there was never anything to do. And I wasted ten years pretending."

"I did the same," David says. "The arrays don't need this much maintenance. I was just... finding excuses to stay away from the apartment. From you. From feeling anything."

"Why?"

"Because feeling hurt. Because connection meant loss. Because if I let myself care, I'd have to face that we're dying. All of us."

They walk in silence. The preserve stretches around them—green and alive and temporary.

"My sister was right," Amara says. "She told me I was hiding. She chose to have a second child after detection—everyone said she was cruel. But she was brave. She saw what mattered and chose it. I saw what mattered and ran from it."

"What matters?" David asks.

"This. You. Us. Connection. Love." Amara stops walking, faces him. "We're dying, David. We have five years. Maybe less if the infrastructure collapses. I don't want to waste them. I want every moment with you. I want to actually be married. I want—"

She's crying. David pulls her close. She holds him like she's drowning, like he's the only solid thing in a collapsing world.

Maybe he is.

Maybe she is for him.

"I'm sorry," he whispers. "I'm sorry I gave up on us."

"I gave up too. We both did."

"But we're trying now."

"Yes. We're trying now."

They stand in the preserve, holding each other, two people who forgot how to connect learning to remember. It's not romantic. Not dramatic. Just: human. Just: necessary.

Just: love.

---

Month three of trying, David realizes something: he's happy.

Not constantly. Not perfectly. But: present. Connected. Alive in ways he forgot were possible.

He still maintains the arrays—that's his work, his function. But now Amara works beside him. They talk while they work. Share observations. Solve problems together. At lunch, they sit on the platforms, legs dangling over the edge, eating and talking and just: being.

At home, they cook together. Clean together. Sleep in the same bed—not sexually at first, just: proximity, bodies remembering each other, intimacy rebuilding slowly.

One night, lying in the dark, Amara says, "I was so angry at you for giving up."

"I know."

"But I gave up too. I gave up on us. On connection. On everything except calculations that didn't matter."

"Why did you reach out?" David asks. "After ten years, why now?"

"Zara. She video called, showed me her children. They were so happy. Living fully despite knowing they're dying. And I realized—I'm dying too, but I'm not living. I'm already dead. We're already dead. And I didn't want that anymore."

David turns to face her in the dark. "I'm glad you reached out."

"Are you?"

"Yes. I forgot how much I love you. I forgot what connection feels like. You reminded me."

She kisses him—tentative at first, then deeper. They make love for the first time in a decade. Awkward. Emotional. Real.

After, lying tangled together, Amara says, "We wasted so much time."

"I know. But we didn't waste the end."

"Five years."

"Five years to do it right."

"Think that's enough?"

"I don't know. But it's what we have."

She curls against him. He holds her close.

Outside, the sun circles. The arrays generate power. The robots maintain perfectly.

Inside, two people who were ghosts become human again.

---

Year 10 becomes Year 11. Four years left.

David and Amara work the arrays together. They're efficient—better than David alone, better than David with robots. They know each other's rhythms, anticipate movements, function as unit.

But they're not mechanical. They talk. Laugh sometimes. Share silence.

Kenji Torres visits the arrays one afternoon—Elena's son, Amara's former student. He's changed since David last saw him. Quieter. More present. Less frantically seeking.

"Amara," Kenji says. "It's good to see you. You look... different."

"Happy," Amara says. "I look happy."

"Yes. That." Kenji smiles. "I'm glad."

They talk—teacher and student reunited. Kenji tells them about Professor Wei, about learning impermanence, about returning home to be present for his mother. About finding peace not in answers but in questions asked gently.

David listens. Realizes: that's what he's doing too. Not finding answers. Just: being present. With Amara. For the time remaining.

When Kenji leaves, Amara says, "He's wiser than I was at his age. Maybe wiser than I am now."

"You're learning," David says. "We both are."

"Learning what?"

"How to be alive. How to be together. How to make time matter."

She takes his hand. They stand on the platform, two hundred meters up, four years left, holding on.

"I love you," Amara says.

"I love you too."

Simple. True. Enough.

---

One evening, they sit in the preserve watching the transplanted trees move in Antarctic wind.

"Zara's confirmed for Year 15," Amara says. "She'll bring Kwame and the children. Maya will be seventeen. Kofi thirteen."

"I'm nervous to meet them."

"Why?"

"Because I wasted ten years. Because I was a ghost when I should have been your husband. Because they're going to see what a failure I was."

Amara squeezes his hand. "You're not a failure. You're human. You struggled. You survived. You're trying now. That's all anyone can do."

"Think that's enough?"

"I think it's everything."

They watch the trees. David realizes: she's right. He failed. They both did. But they're trying now. They're present now. They're alive now.

Four years until impact.

Four years to be married.

Four years to love fully.

Four years to be human.

It's not enough time.

But it's what they have.

And maybe—maybe—that's everything.

"Thank you," David says quietly.

"For what?"

"For not giving up. For reaching out. For giving us a second chance."

"Thank you for saying yes. For trying. For being here."

They sit until dark—except it doesn't get dark, Antarctic summer, sun circling endlessly. They sit until tired. Then walk home. Make dinner. Clean together. Sleep tangled together.

Two people who were ghosts.

Two people who are human again.

Two people who wasted ten years but won't waste four more.

Outside, the robots maintain perfectly. The arrays generate power. The systems function.

Inside, David and Amara function too.

But not mechanically.

Not anymore.

They function as humans.

As partners.

As the marriage they should have been all along.

It's not perfect. They fight sometimes. Struggle. Face hard moments.

But they face them together.

And together—finally, impossibly, gratefully—is enough.

On the platform, two hundred meters up, they hold hands and watch the sun circle and know:

Four years.

Four years to love.

Four years to be present.

Four years to be alive.

Not enough.

But everything.

Always everything.

The robots maintain. The arrays function. The systems operate.

And David and Amara—after ten years of dying—finally start living.

Together.

At last.

With time enough to make it matter.

With love enough to make it real.

With presence enough to make it everything.

Four years.

Starting now.
