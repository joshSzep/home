# Chapter 7 - Wei

The flowers needed watering.

Professor Mei-Lin Wei moved slowly through her small garden, cane in her left hand, watering can in her right. Each step deliberate. She was one hundred fourteen years old, and her body reminded her of this fact constantly. Knees that complained. Back that ached. Hands that shook slightly when she lifted things.

But the mind was still clear. That was what mattered.

The garden was small—just a square of earth behind her Lagos house, perhaps ten meters by ten. But she'd filled it carefully over the decade since moving here. Native flowers mostly. Some vegetables. A small lemon tree that gave fruit twice a year. Everything in its season, everything impermanent, everything returning to soil.

She was watering the gardenias when the alert came.

The house system chimed—emergency broadcast, priority override. Through her window she could hear other houses doing the same, the whole neighborhood lighting up with alerts.

Wei set down the watering can carefully and walked inside. Pulled up the broadcast on her screen.

The words were simple. Almost absurdly so, given their weight.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact in 15 years. Deflection not possible.

She read it twice, making sure she understood correctly. Then she turned off the screen and walked back outside to finish watering.

The gardenias still needed water. The asteroid didn't change that.

---

She was checking the lemon tree—looking for signs of the scale insects that sometimes plagued it—when she heard running footsteps.

"Professor Wei!"

Zara burst through the gate, her two-year-old daughter Maya on her hip. Zara's face was tear-streaked, her eyes wild.

"Professor Wei, did you see? Did you see the broadcast?"

"Yes, dear. I saw."

"An asteroid! In fifteen years! Everyone's going to die!" Zara's voice rose toward hysteria. Maya started crying, picking up her mother's panic. "My daughter will die! She's two! She'll be seventeen! She'll never—she'll never—"

Zara collapsed onto Wei's garden bench, sobbing.

Wei set down her gardening tools and sat beside her. Not touching yet, just present. Letting Zara feel what she needed to feel.

After a few minutes, the sobs quieted. Maya had calmed too, thumb in mouth, watching her mother with wide eyes.

"How are you so calm?" Zara asked finally. "Doesn't this terrify you?"

Wei considered the question. "I've been one hundred fourteen years old for three months," she said. "I've known I would die soon for the past decade. Now I learn that you'll die soon too. That everyone will. It's terrible for you, Zara. You're forty-one. You should have had another lifetime. Maya should have had a full life. That's a real loss, and I'm sorry for it."

"But?"

"But death was always coming. For me, for you, for Maya. We just didn't know when. Now we do. That doesn't change what death is. Only when it arrives."

Zara stared at her. "That's it? That's your wisdom? We're all going to die anyway, so this doesn't matter?"

"No," Wei said gently. "This matters enormously. But not because it makes death real—death was always real. It matters because now everyone knows their time is short. And that changes how we live." She gestured at the garden. "These flowers will die this winter. They always do. I plant them anyway. They're beautiful now. That's enough."

"Flowers aren't children."

"No. But the principle is the same. Temporary doesn't mean meaningless. It means precious."

Maya had climbed down from Zara's lap and was toddling toward the lemon tree. Wei watched her—small hands reaching up, delighted by a low-hanging fruit.

"She's beautiful," Wei said quietly.

"She's going to die."

"Yes. And that's terrible. But she's beautiful now. Watch her. She's experiencing wonder right now, in this moment. The asteroid doesn't touch that."

Zara watched her daughter. Fresh tears came, but quieter. "I don't know how to do this. How to live fifteen years knowing it ends. How to watch her grow up knowing she'll never be an adult. Never have children. Never—" Her voice broke.

Wei took her hand. The touch was light—her old fingers had little strength left. "You'll learn. Not today. But you'll learn. Humans are extraordinary at adaptation. At finding meaning even in impossible situations. You'll find a way."

"How did you learn? How are you so... so accepting?"

Wei smiled. "I'm one hundred fourteen years old, dear. I've been practicing for a very long time."

---

After Zara left—taking Maya home for lunch, still shaken but calmer—Wei returned to her garden.

The scale insects were indeed on the lemon tree. She'd need to treat them. Tomorrow perhaps. Today she was tired.

She sat on the bench and looked at what she'd made here. The garden had been bare earth when she arrived in Lagos ten years ago. She'd planted everything herself, slowly, over years. Learned which plants thrived in this soil. Which needed more water, which less. The rhythms of the seasons here, different from Beijing but no less beautiful.

She'd planted this garden knowing she'd probably die before some of the plants did. The lemon tree, for instance—it could live another fifty years. Long after Wei turned to ash.

She'd planted it anyway.

Now she learned that the tree would die in fifteen years. That all the gardens everywhere would die. That no one would see spring after 3040.

It should have been devastating. In a way, it was—she felt genuine grief for the young people, for children like Maya who'd barely begun.

But for herself? She'd been ready to die for twenty years. Had buried her husband ten years ago and thought she might follow him soon. Instead, she'd gotten a decade in Lagos—teaching occasionally, writing, corresponding with old students and scholars, tending this garden. It had been a gift.

Dying now, or in a year, or in fifteen—it didn't matter much.

What mattered was what she did with the time.

---

Over the next weeks, people started coming to her.

First just neighbors—Zara most days, sometimes staying for hours while Maya played in the garden. Then friends of neighbors. Then strangers who'd heard there was an old philosopher who wasn't panicking.

Wei didn't advertise. Didn't set hours. Just kept her door open and talked to whoever came.

A young man, mid-twenties, angry and lost: "What's the point? What's the fucking point of anything if we're all going to die?"

Wei: "You were always going to die. So was I. Everyone you love was going to die eventually. The asteroid just moved up the timeline. The point of life was never to live forever. It was to live."

"That's not good enough."

"I know. But it's what we have."

An old woman, eighty-three, bitter: "I made it this far. Survived disease, wars, outlived everyone I loved. I thought I'd earned a natural death. Peaceful. Now I die with everyone else in fire."

Wei: "Any death is natural. This is how the universe works—asteroids, entropy, extinction. It feels unfair because we thought we had more time. But time was never guaranteed."

"You don't understand."

"You're right. I don't understand your specific pain. But I understand loss. I've buried everyone I loved. I'm still here. Still finding reasons to water flowers."

A mother with three children, youngest six: "How do I explain this to them? How do I help them live fifteen years knowing they'll never grow up?"

Wei: "The same way you'd help them live if you knew they had a terminal illness. With love. With presence. Let them be children. Let them play. Don't weigh them down with adult grief unless they ask. They'll learn about death in their own time."

"Is that enough?"

"I don't know. But it's what love looks like when death is certain."

She had no easy answers. No formulas. Just what she'd learned in one hundred fourteen years of living and thirty years of studying philosophy.

Impermanence is fundamental. Clinging causes suffering. Meaning is made, not found. Love anyway.

Some people left angry. Some left comforted. Some left more confused than they arrived.

Wei didn't mind. She wasn't trying to fix anyone. Just bearing witness. Offering presence.

That was all she had to give.

---

Three months after the detection, Zara came to visit with news.

"I'm pregnant."

Wei looked up from the journal she was writing in. Zara stood in the garden doorway, hand on her belly, expression fierce and fragile at once.

"Deliberately?" Wei asked.

"Yes. My husband thought I was crazy. But I want another child. Even though—even though they'll die young. Maybe especially because of that. I want to create life anyway. Is that insane?"

Wei set down her pen. Gestured for Zara to sit.

"No," she said. "It's not insane. It's what life does."

"Everyone says I'm being selfish. Cruel. Bringing a child into a world that's ending. They say it's a death sentence."

"Life is always a death sentence," Wei said quietly. "We're born, we die. Your first child was always going to die. You didn't know when, but death was certain. This child will die in fifteen years instead of eighty. That's terrible. But it's not more terrible than any death. Just more visible."

Zara's eyes filled with tears. "I don't want to live fifteen years without creating something. Without hope. Even if the hope is temporary."

"All hope is temporary. That doesn't make it false."

"Everyone thinks I'm wrong."

"Maybe you are. I don't know. But I know that flowers bloom in autumn. That trees fruit before winter. That life creates life, even at the end. Maybe especially at the end." Wei reached over and took Zara's hand. "Do you want this child?"

"Yes. More than anything."

"Then have this child. Love them. Let them be your defiance against despair. Let them be proof that meaning exists even when everything ends."

Zara cried then—deep, wrenching sobs. But underneath the grief, Wei heard something else.

Relief. Permission. Hope.

When she'd cried herself out, Zara looked at Wei with something like wonder. "How did you get so wise?"

Wei laughed—a dry, creaking sound. "By living one hundred fourteen years and paying attention. And reading many very smart dead people who thought about these questions. I didn't invent any of this, dear. I'm just old enough to have learned it."

"Will you be there? When the baby comes?"

"If I'm still alive, yes. I'll be there."

Zara left smiling.

Wei returned to her journal. She was writing a series of essays—reflections on impermanence, mortality, meaning-making in the face of extinction. Not for publication really. Just thinking on paper. Leaving thoughts behind in case anyone found them useful.

She wrote: *We thought Forever Earth meant we had endless time. Billions of years to solve problems, to grow, to become whatever we might become. The asteroid reveals what was always true: time is finite. Forever was always an illusion. Now we must learn what humans have always had to learn—how to make meaning in the face of death. How to love what we'll lose. How to bloom in autumn.*

Outside, Maya was playing with the lemon tree again. Zara's daughter, who would die at seventeen.

Wei watched her through the window. The child's delight in the simple act of touching leaves. Her laughter when a butterfly landed nearby.

Temporary and precious.

That was all anything ever was.

---

Six months after the detection, Elena Torres came to visit.

Not in person—Elena was on the other side of the continent, managing crisis after crisis. But they'd been corresponding by letter for years, ever since Elena's late husband Hiroshi had been Wei's student. When Hiroshi died, Elena had written to Wei. They'd maintained the friendship.

Now Elena called, her face on Wei's screen looking exhausted.

"Professor Wei. I hope this isn't an intrusion."

"Not at all, Elena. It's good to see you."

"I need—" Elena stopped. Started again. "I don't know how to do this. How to lead when there's no future. When everything I do is temporary. The councils meet, we make plans, we manage resources. But for what? Why govern a city that will be ash in fifteen years?"

Wei studied the younger woman's face. Elena was sixty-eight—young by Wei's standards, but old enough to know herself. She looked hollowed out. Like she'd been running on purpose for decades and suddenly the purpose had evaporated.

"You govern because people need governing," Wei said. "Because in fifteen years, millions of people will wake up every day needing food, shelter, order, meaning. Your job isn't to save them from death—that was never your job. Your job is to help them live with dignity until death comes."

"But nothing I do *matters*."

"Why did it matter before? Because you thought your work would outlast you? Because you thought progress was building toward some eternal future?" Wei shook her head gently. "That was always an illusion, Elena. Every empire falls. Every civilization ends. Yours will end in fifteen years instead of fifteen thousand. That doesn't change what matters. What matters is now. The people alive today. Tomorrow. Next year. They need someone to organize food distribution. To maintain power grids. To say 'this is how we'll live while we're living.' That's what leadership always was."

Elena was quiet for a long moment. "You make it sound simple."

"It's not simple. It's impossibly hard. But it's what you've been doing anyway. Just with more honesty now. Before, you could pretend permanence. Now you can't. So you lead toward presence instead. Toward dignity. Toward making each day bearable. That's enough."

"Is it?"

"It's all any leader ever did. You've just been forced to see it clearly."

After they ended the call, Wei sat in her garden thinking about power. She'd never wanted it. Never sought it. But she'd seen people with power her whole life—politicians, administrators, wealthy industrialists. They all acted like what they built would last.

None of it lasted.

Everything she'd seen built in one hundred fourteen years had crumbled or changed beyond recognition. The cities of her youth were gone. The governments different. The technologies transformed.

Only principles endured: kindness, cruelty, love, fear, meaning-making, suffering.

The asteroid didn't change that.

It just made it obvious.

---

One year after the detection, a young man arrived at Wei's door.

Tall, mixed heritage, intense dark eyes. He looked exhausted and searching.

"Professor Wei?"

"Yes."

"My name is Kenji Torres. Elena Torres is my mother. She said you might talk with me. If you have time. If not, I—"

"Come in," Wei said.

Kenji sat in her small living room—barely more than a few chairs and a table, walls covered in books. He looked around, taking it in.

"Elena's son," Wei said, settling into her chair carefully. "How is she?"

"Surviving. Barely. Trying to hold everything together while it falls apart." He met her eyes. "I dropped out of university. Spent six months trying to escape what happened. Parties, drugs, meaningless sex. Didn't work. Now I'm traveling. Asking people how they're surviving this. What they've found that helps."

"And what have you found?"

"That most people are barely holding on. That the structures are crumbling. That meaning is collapsing everywhere." He leaned forward. "My mother said you weren't collapsing. That you had something. Tools, maybe. For living with this."

Wei smiled. "I'm one hundred fifteen years old. I've been preparing to die for twenty years. I'm not a good model for a young person trying to figure out how to live."

"You're the only person I've met who isn't terrified."

"I am terrified," Wei corrected gently. "But not of death. I'm terrified for people like you. People who thought they had time. Who have to compress a lifetime of meaning-making into fifteen years. That's harder than anything I've faced."

"So how do I do it?"

Wei looked at this young man—twenty-five years old, maybe less. His whole life ahead of him, except it wasn't. Fifteen years, maximum. Probably less if there were wars or plagues or any of the collapse scenarios people were predicting.

"I don't know," she admitted. "I don't have a formula. But I can share what I've learned. What humans have always learned about living with death. Buddhist principles about impermanence and non-attachment. Existentialist ideas about making meaning in an absurd universe. Humanist focus on what we can do for each other. It's not a solution. But it's tools. Ways of thinking that might help."

"Will you teach me?"

Wei studied him. Saw genuine hunger. Genuine openness. "I can try. But I don't take students anymore. I'm too old. I teach until I'm tired, then I rest. If you're willing to accept that—no curriculum, no schedule, just conversations when I have energy—then yes. Stay. Learn what you can."

Kenji nodded. "Thank you."

He stayed three months.

Wei taught him what she could. Not religion—she wasn't religious. But philosophy as tool. Buddhism as psychological framework, not theology. Existentialism as radical responsibility for making meaning. Humanism as ethic of care even in meaninglessness.

They sat in the garden most days. Wei talked. Kenji listened. Sometimes Kenji talked and Wei listened. Sometimes they sat in silence watching Maya play.

One day Wei picked a flower—a gardenia, just opened, perfect white petals.

"This flower bloomed this morning," she said. "By tomorrow it will start to brown. In three days it will be dead. Does that make it less beautiful?"

"No," Kenji said.

"Why not?"

"Because beauty isn't about lasting. It's about being."

"Yes." Wei handed him the flower. "You think the asteroid makes life meaningless because life won't last. But life was always not lasting. Every human who ever lived died. Every flower that ever bloomed withered. Impermanence is the nature of reality. The asteroid just made it visible and collective. But the principle is the same. Meaning isn't in lasting. Meaning is in being present to what is, while it is."

Kenji held the flower, staring at it.

Then he started crying.

Deep, wrenching sobs. Grief that had been building for a year, finally breaking through.

Wei said nothing. Just sat with him. Let him feel it.

When he'd cried himself out, he looked at her. "I don't want to die. I'm not ready."

"I know."

"I'm so angry. That I don't get a full life. That no one does."

"Yes. That anger is real and justified."

"How do I live with it?"

"You feel it. You don't push it away. Anger at injustice is appropriate—this is unjust. But you don't let the anger consume everything. You make space for it, and for joy, and for love, and for beauty. You hold it all. That's what it means to be human."

Kenji stayed another month after that. Learning. Processing. Growing quieter, more centered.

When he left, he hugged Wei carefully—aware of her fragility.

"Thank you," he said.

"Go find your way," Wei told him. "You have fifteen years. Maybe less, maybe a little more. Live them. Don't waste them on despair. But don't waste them on false hope either. Just live them."

She watched him walk away, tall and young and searching.

One of millions trying to figure out how to be human when the end was visible.

She hoped he'd find his way.

But she wouldn't live to see it.

She could feel her own death approaching now. Not the asteroid death—natural death. She was one hundred fifteen. Her body was failing in small ways that would cascade to large ones soon.

Maybe she had two years left. Maybe five. Probably not fifteen.

She'd die individually, the old way, before the collective death came.

There was something fitting about that.

A reminder that individual death still existed. Still mattered.

That each person's death was their own, even when everyone died together eventually.

Wei went back to her garden. The gardenias needed deadheading. The lemon tree had new fruit forming.

She had work to do while she was still here.

That was enough.

That had always been enough.
