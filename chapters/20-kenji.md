# Chapter 20: Kenji

The gardenia blooms in Wei's garden, white petals perfect against the morning light. Professor Wei kneels beside it—slowly, carefully, one hand bracing against the earth. She's 119 years old. Everything takes time now.

Kenji Tanaka watches from the doorway, holding her tea. He's been in Lagos for eight months, living in the small guest room of her home, learning what she calls "nothing at all."

"Kenji," she says without looking up. "Come see."

He crosses the garden, bare feet on warm dirt. Lagos stretches around them—three million people still, down from five but still vibrant, still alive. The city hums. Music from somewhere. Children laughing in the next compound. Life continuing because what else would it do?

He kneels beside her, offers the tea. She takes it with both hands, nodding thanks.

"You see this flower?" Wei asks.

Kenji looks. The gardenia is beautiful—flawless white petals, sweet fragrance, perfect structure. "I see it."

"It bloomed yesterday," Wei says. "By tomorrow, the petals will brown. Three days, it will fall. Two weeks, nothing left but memory."

She sips her tea, gazing at the flower like it contains all wisdom.

"I've seen this same plant bloom for fifteen years," she continues. "Every year, same cycle. Buds appear. Flowers open. Beauty happens. Then: gone. Every year, I think maybe this time it will last. But no. Impermanence is the only constant."

Kenji has heard variations of this lesson for months. Impermanence. Non-clinging. The illusion of permanence. Wei teaches Buddhism as philosophy, not religion—she doesn't ask him to believe in reincarnation or enlightenment or karma. Just: observe truth.

Truth: everything ends.

"The asteroid doesn't change this," Wei says quietly. "Asteroid or not, the flower was always temporary. Your life was always temporary. My life—" she smiles, "—very temporary now. The asteroid just makes it visible."

"That's supposed to be comforting?" Kenji asks.

"Is it not?"

He doesn't know how to answer. For eight months, he's sat in this garden, listened to Wei's gentle teachings, tried to understand what she sees that he can't. She's calm—not resigned, not despairing, just... clear. Like she's been practicing for the end her entire life.

He's 32 years old. He traveled the world seeking meaning—Tokyo's pleasure districts, Buddhist temples, Hindu ashrams, Jerusalem's contested streets. He met Ibrahim there, another seeker, though Ibrahim was seeking faith while Kenji sought its absence. They talked for three days about belief and doubt. Then Ibrahim returned to fighting, and Kenji returned here, to Wei, because she was the only person who admitted she had no answers.

"I don't understand how you're not terrified," Kenji says.

Wei sets down her tea, reaches out with a gnarled hand to touch the gardenia petals. So gentle. Like blessing it.

"I am old," she says. "I would die soon anyway—five years, ten, fifteen at most. The asteroid just... clarifies. Takes away the maybe. I was going to lose this garden, these flowers, this body. The asteroid doesn't steal anything I wasn't going to lose."

"But everyone else—"

"Everyone else was also temporary. You knew this, Kenji. You've always known. Your mind understood impermanence since you were child. But—" she taps his chest lightly, "—here, you never accepted. You thought if you searched hard enough, if you understood enough, if you *tried* enough, you could find something permanent. Something that lasts."

Her eyes, ancient and kind, hold his.

"But nothing lasts. Nothing was ever going to last. The asteroid is just... honest."

Something breaks in Kenji's chest. Not painful—just: breaking. Like ice cracking, like dams releasing, like breath held too long finally exhaled.

He starts crying.

Wei doesn't move, doesn't comfort. She just sits beside him, hand on the gardenia, letting him break.

He cries for ten minutes. For the years spent searching. For the hedonism that felt hollow. For the temples where he couldn't force faith. For Ibrahim's desperate certainty crumbling. For his mother Elena governing a city that's dying. For Amara's wasted calculations. For the seven billion people who won't see another generation.

For the gardenia that's already dying.

When the crying stops, he feels... not better. Not worse. Just: emptied.

"Sorry," he whispers.

"For what?"

"For... I don't know. Breaking down."

"Kenji." Wei smiles. "That wasn't breaking down. That was breaking open. Very different."

She stands—slowly, painfully, refusing his offered hand—and moves toward the house. "Come. I'm making lunch. You'll help."

They cook together in her small kitchen. Wei moving carefully, Kenji chopping vegetables, both of them silent in comfortable rhythm. Through the window, he sees Zara's compound next door—Zara, his mother's friend, who chose to have a second child after detection. Her daughter Maya is nine now, her son Kofi six. They're playing in the courtyard, their laughter floating over the wall.

"You met Zara's children?" Wei asks, reading his gaze.

"A few times. Maya asked me why I travel so much."

"What did you tell her?"

"That I was looking for something."

"Did she ask if you found it?"

Kenji pauses, knife hovering over the cutting board. "She asked what I was looking for."

"And?"

"I didn't know how to answer."

Wei hums, stirring soup. "Maybe because you don't know. Maybe you're not looking *for* something. Maybe you're looking *from* something."

He sets down the knife. "From what?"

"Impermanence. Uncertainty. The truth that nothing lasts and you can't control anything and there's no permanent meaning you can extract and hold forever." She tastes the soup, adds salt. "You're not seeking truth, Kenji. You're fleeing it."

The words land like stones. Heavy, undeniable.

"But I came here," he says. "To learn from you."

"Yes. Because I'm very old and dying soon and you thought maybe I'd give you answer before I go." Wei smiles, gentle, not mocking. "But I have no answer. Just: be here. Be present. Stop seeking what cannot be found. The flower blooms, the flower dies, and between—beauty. That's all. That's everything."

She ladles soup into bowls. They eat on the porch, watching the afternoon settle over Lagos. The city breathes—vendors calling, music playing, life happening because life happens until it doesn't.

"How long will you stay?" Wei asks.

"I don't know. As long as you'll have me, I guess."

"I'll have you as long as I'm here," she says. "But I won't be here forever."

"I know."

"Do you?" She sets down her soup, looks at him directly. "Kenji. I'm 119. I've lived through three pandemics, two small wars, the Forever Earth crisis, now the asteroid. I've buried two husbands, three children, most of my friends. I've taught philosophy for seventy years. I'm tired. When I die—soon now, maybe months, maybe a year—it will be natural. I will be ready."

Kenji's throat tightens. "Don't talk about—"

"Why not? It's true. You came here to learn impermanence. I'm impermanent. I'm teaching you by existing." She reaches across, pats his hand. "When I die, you'll grieve. That's good. Grief means love happened. But then: keep living. Keep being present. Don't flee into more seeking. Just: be."

"I don't know how."

"Yes you do. You're doing it now."

They finish lunch in silence. Wei naps—she naps often now, her body conserving energy, preparing for the end. Kenji washes dishes, then walks to Zara's compound.

Maya and Kofi are still playing—building something with scrap metal and wire, their hands dirty, their focus absolute. Zara sits under the awning, watching them with fierce devotion. She looks up when Kenji approaches.

"Kenji! Come, sit. You hungry? I have—"

"Just ate with Professor Wei. Thank you."

"How is she?"

"Tired. But... herself."

Zara nods, understanding what he's not saying. "She's the strongest person I know. Fragile and strong at the same time."

Maya looks up from her project. "Kenji! Come see what we're making!"

He crosses to them, kneels in the dirt. They've constructed some kind of sculpture—abstract, chaotic, beautiful. "What is it?"

"A bird," Kofi says, like it's obvious.

"A bird that's also a tree," Maya corrects. "Because birds live in trees, so why separate them?"

Kenji smiles. "That's... actually profound."

"What's profound mean?" Kofi asks.

"Means smart. Means you thought of something true."

"I think of true things all the time," Kofi says seriously. "Like yesterday I thought: why do adults always look sad? And that's true. You all look sad."

Maya elbows him. "That's rude, Kofi."

"But it's *true*."

Zara laughs—warm, full. "He's not wrong. We probably do look sad." She meets Kenji's eyes. "But we're not just sad. We're also here. We're also living."

Maya turns to Kenji, her nine-year-old face too serious. "Are you sad?"

He considers lying, decides against it. "Yeah. Sometimes."

"Why?"

"Because... I'm looking for something I can't find."

"What are you looking for?"

"I don't know."

Maya nods, like this makes perfect sense. "My mama says sometimes we look for things that aren't real. Like when Kofi looks for monsters under his bed. There's no monsters, but he looks anyway."

"Hey!" Kofi protests.

"It's true! You do!"

Kenji laughs despite himself. "Your mama is smart."

"I know," Maya says. "That's why I'm going to be an engineer like her. When I'm big."

The words hang in the air. *When I'm big.* Maya is nine. In eight years, there won't be big. There won't be engineering. There won't be anything.

But Zara doesn't correct her. Doesn't remind her. Just smiles and says, "You'll be a great engineer."

Kenji stays for an hour, helping them build their bird-tree, listening to their chatter, watching Zara watch them with love so fierce it hurts. When he leaves, Maya hugs him—surprising, spontaneous—and says, "I hope you find what you're looking for."

"Thank you," he says.

But walking back to Wei's house, he thinks: *I hope I stop looking.*

That night, Wei teaches him meditation. Not religious—just: sitting, breathing, observing. They sit in her garden, the gardenia already browning, the evening settling warm around them.

"Don't try to empty mind," Wei says. "Mind fills. That's what it does. Just: watch. Watch thoughts come, watch thoughts go. Don't cling, don't push away. Just: observe."

Kenji tries. His mind churns—thoughts of his mother in Antarctica, of Amara calculating the incalculable, of David maintaining arrays for no one, of Ibrahim fighting for land no one will inherit, of Zara raising children who won't grow up, of the gardenia dying, of Wei dying, of himself dying, of everyone dying, of—

"Kenji," Wei says softly. "You're trying too hard. Just breathe."

He breathes.

The thoughts keep coming. But slowly, something shifts. Not the thoughts stopping—just: space appearing between them. Little gaps. Moments of just breathing, just being, just sitting in a garden while the world ends slowly around him.

It's not peace. Not enlightenment. Not answer.

But it's... something. A beginning.

They sit until dark. When Wei stands, she needs his help. Her legs shake. She's lighter than she should be, her body consuming itself, preparing for the end.

"Thank you," she says.

"For what?"

"For being here. For learning. For trying." She touches his face, brief and gentle. "You're a good student, Kenji. Because you're willing to not know."

He helps her inside, helps her to bed. She falls asleep quickly, breathing shallow but steady. Kenji sits in her kitchen, drinking tea, watching the dark garden through the window.

He thinks about Maya's question: *What are you looking for?*

He thinks about Wei's answer: *Stop seeking what cannot be found.*

He thinks about the gardenia, blooming and dying, beautiful and temporary, meaning nothing and everything.

And for the first time in years—maybe ever—Kenji thinks: *I could go home.*

Not running. Not seeking. Just: being with his mother for the years that remain. Being with Amara, his mentor who he abandoned. Being present instead of fleeing.

The thought terrifies him.

But it also... settles something. A weight he didn't know he was carrying, finally set down.

The next morning, Wei finds him in the garden. The gardenia has dropped half its petals. Two days, it'll be gone.

"You're leaving," she says. Not question. Observation.

"How did you know?"

"Your face is different. Quieter. You decided something."

Kenji nods. "I think... I think I need to go home. See my mother. Stop running."

Wei smiles—deep, genuine, proud. "Good."

"I'll stay until—"

"No." She shakes her head. "Don't wait for me to die. That's clinging. I'll die when I die. You: live while you live. Go. Be with your mother. Be present."

"But what if—"

"Kenji." She takes his hands, her grip surprisingly strong. "You came here seeking answer. I gave you none. But you learned anyway. You learned the only thing: be here. Be now. Stop seeking permanence. Just: be." She squeezes his hands. "Now go be with your mother."

He leaves two days later. Zara and the children come to say goodbye. Maya gives him a drawing—the bird-tree sculpture, rendered in crayon. "So you remember us," she says.

"I could never forget you," Kenji says.

Kofi asks, "Did you find what you were looking for?"

Kenji crouches down, meeting the six-year-old's eyes. "No. But I learned to stop looking. That's better, I think."

"That doesn't make sense," Kofi says.

"I know. But it's true anyway."

Wei walks him to the transit station—slowly, leaning on his arm. At the departure platform, she hugs him. Brief, tight, final.

"Thank you," Kenji says. "For teaching me nothing."

"You're welcome. For learning everything." She releases him, steps back. "Kenji. When I die—"

"Don't—"

"Listen. When I die, don't grieve too long. Just remember: the flower bloomed. That's enough. It was always enough."

He gets on the transport before he starts crying. Through the window, he watches Wei standing on the platform, one hand raised in farewell, her small frame solid and temporary, teaching to the end.

The transport pulls away. Lagos shrinks behind him. Ahead: Antarctica, his mother, his home, his life waiting to be lived instead of fled.

He doesn't have answers. Doesn't have certainty. Doesn't have permanence or meaning or faith or enlightenment.

But he has eight years. Maybe more. Maybe less. Doesn't matter.

What matters: being present for them. Being with people he loves. Stopping the seeking, starting the being.

The gardenia is dying. The world is dying. He is dying.

But for now, he's alive.

And maybe—maybe—that's enough.

It has to be.

It always was.

He just needed to stop running long enough to see it.

Kenji closes his eyes, feels the transport moving, carries Wei's teachings and Maya's drawing and the memory of the gardenia blooming perfect and temporary.

Going home.

Finally.

Eight years left.

Time enough to be present.

Time enough to stop seeking.

Time enough to just: be.

The flower blooms, the flower dies, and between—beauty.

That's all.

That's everything.
