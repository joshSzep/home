# Chapter 2 - Reactions

Maya was building a tower.

Zara Okafor-Mensah sat on the floor of their Lagos District apartment, watching her daughter stack colored blocks with fierce concentration. Two years old, still unsteady on her feet but determined. Each block placed carefully, tongue poking out slightly the way it did when Maya was focused.

"Look, Mama!" Maya pointed at her creation. "Big!"

"So big," Zara agreed, smiling. "Almost as big as you."

The emergency broadcast interrupted them mid-laugh.

Every screen in the apartment activated simultaneously—walls, kitchen display, even Zara's work tablet. The global AI system alert, priority one. Zara had never seen it used in her entire life.

EXTINCTION-LEVEL ASTEROID DETECTED, the text flashed. IMPACT PROBABILITY 99.97%. ESTIMATED TIME TO IMPACT: 15 YEARS, 2 MONTHS, 14 DAYS.

Zara stared at the display. Read it again. The words didn't make sense together—extinction, asteroid, fifteen years. They were individual words she understood, but together they formed something impossible.

A video feed replaced the text. UN official speaking with careful precision about trajectories and verification protocols and deflection scenarios that had all failed. Numbers appeared: the asteroid's size, its velocity, the energy it would release on impact.

Zara's engineering training kicked in automatically. She understood the scale of energy release. Understood what "civilization-killer" meant in practical terms. Understood that when they said "extinction-level" they meant exactly that.

In fifteen years, everything would end.

"Mama?" Maya's small hand tugged at her sleeve. "Mama, what's wrong?"

Zara looked at her daughter. Two years old. She'd been planning Maya's third birthday party. Had already enrolled her in the early learning program for next year. Had been thinking about what schools she'd attend, what she'd study, what she'd become.

In fifteen years, Maya would be seventeen.

She'd never turn eighteen. Never fall in love. Never have children of her own. Never become the brilliant, kind person Zara could already see forming in her toddler's fierce independence and quick curiosity.

Seventeen years old, and then nothing.

"Mama?" Maya's voice was scared now. "Why are you crying?"

Zara hadn't realized she was crying. She pulled Maya into her arms, holding her so tight that Maya squirmed and protested.

"Mama, too tight!"

Zara loosened her grip but didn't let go. Couldn't let go. She grabbed her comm with shaking hands and called Kwame.

He answered on the first ring. "Zara—"

"Come home." Her voice came out strangled. "Come home right now."

"I'm on my way. Is Maya—"

"We're fine. We're—" She stopped. Were they fine? The world was ending. "Just come home. Please."

She ended the call and immediately dialed Amara. Her older sister. Brilliant Amara who understood space and asteroids and orbital mechanics. Amara who would tell her this was a mistake, a false alarm, that they'd calculated wrong.

Amara answered. She looked terrible—exhausted, hollowed out.

"Zara—"

"Is it real?" Zara interrupted. "Tell me it's not real. Tell me they made a mistake."

Amara's face on the screen was answer enough, but she said it anyway: "It's real."

"Can they stop it? Can you—can anyone—"

"No."

That one word. So simple. So final.

"But Maya—" Zara's voice broke completely. "She's two. She's only two. She'll be—"

"Seventeen." Amara's voice was flat, clinical. Like she was discussing data instead of her niece's death. "I know."

"How can you be so calm? How can you just—"

"I've known for three hours. I'm the one who detected it. I've run every calculation. There's nothing we can do."

Zara started sobbing. Couldn't help it. Maya was patting her face now, confused and frightened by her mother's tears.

"I'm sorry," Amara said quietly. "I'm so sorry."

"I have to go." Zara couldn't keep talking. Couldn't keep looking at her sister's devastated face. "Kwame's coming home."

She ended the call and sat on the floor with Maya in her lap, surrounded by scattered building blocks, watching the broadcasts continue on every screen. Different channels, different voices, all saying the same impossible thing.

The world was ending. Fifteen years. Extinction certain.

Maya wiggled free and went back to her tower. She didn't understand. How could she possibly understand?

How was Zara supposed to explain this to her?

###

Two hundred meters above Antarctica's ice surface, David Chen was replacing a connection on Solar Array 7-Delta when the alert came through on the platform radio.

The work was methodical, familiar. Check connection integrity, clean dust from panels, verify power output. He'd done it a thousand times, preferring the graveyard shift when the arrays worked better in sunlight and he didn't have to interrupt their function.

He was alone up here. Preferred that too.

The radio crackled—AI emergency broadcast, priority override. David paused, wrench in hand, and listened.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact probability 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. Deflection not possible.

He stood on the platform, two hundred meters above Antarctica, and looked at the sky. Dawn was starting to break—pale light washing over the solar arrays that stretched in every direction, thousands of panels catching the first rays of sun to power the city of four billion below.

In fifteen years, all of this would be gone.

These panels he was maintaining. The city they powered. The four billion people sleeping in their beds. Amara, sleeping alone in theirs because he'd left before she woke. All of it: gone.

He couldn't see the asteroid. It was too far, too small, lost in the vastness of space. But it was there. Coming at them at impossible speed, following the immutable laws of orbital mechanics that Amara had tried to explain to him once.

He hadn't understood the math. He understood outcomes.

And the outcome was certain.

David stood there for a long time, holding his wrench, watching the sun rise over arrays that would function for fifteen more years and then vaporize.

Then he finished replacing the connection he'd been working on.

Habit. Training. The panel needed maintenance regardless of whether humanity had fifteen years or fifteen thousand. He tightened the bolts with careful precision, verified the connection, logged it in his maintenance report.

Then he climbed down.

The platform elevator descended slowly. Three minutes for two hundred meters. David watched the city wake up around him. Lights coming on in residential towers. The night shift ending at the hydroponic farms. Transport pods beginning their morning routes.

All of it would continue for fifteen years. And then stop.

His comm lit up with messages—dozens of them. The news was spreading. People reaching out, panicking, seeking connection. He ignored them all and headed home.

###

The door burst open while Zara was still on the floor with Maya.

Kwame, breathless, wild-eyed. He looked at Zara sitting there, looked at Maya playing innocently with her blocks, looked at the screens still broadcasting news of the end.

"Zara—"

She stood up and walked into his arms. He held her, and she held him, and they stood in their living room while their daughter played at their feet and their future collapsed around them.

"What do we do?" Kwame whispered.

"I don't know."

They stayed like that until Maya got frustrated with a block that wouldn't balance and called for help. Then they separated, and Zara knelt down to help her daughter build a tower that would last until bedtime, in a world that would last fifteen more years.

###

Amara wasn't home when David arrived.

Of course she wasn't. She'd be at the monitoring station, dealing with the crisis. She'd probably been the one to detect it—that was her job, watching the sky for threats. She'd found one that couldn't be stopped.

David stood in their apartment, listening to the silence.

They'd lived here for thirteen years. Good apartment by Antarctica standards—two bedrooms they didn't use, a kitchen Amara barely cooked in, a living space where they occasionally crossed paths. Comfortable. Distant. The apartment of two people who were married but not quite together anymore.

He'd let that happen. Let her drift into her work, let himself drift into his. It had been easier than confronting the slow dissolution of what they'd once had.

Now they had fifteen years left, and he'd wasted how many already?

His comm chimed. Amara.

He accepted the call. She looked exhausted—still at the station, surrounded by screens and data. Her face was drawn, her eyes shadowed.

"I saw the alert," he said.

"I'm the one who detected it. I've been here since three AM. Running calculations, trying to find a way to stop it. There isn't one."

"Are you coming home?"

"I need to stay. The director is coming in. There are going to be meetings, briefings—" She stopped, seemed to realize the futility. "I need to be here."

David nodded. Of course she did. When had she not needed to be somewhere else?

"Okay. I'll be here when you get back."

"David—"

He waited. She looked like she wanted to say something important. Instead:

"Nothing. I'll see you later."

The call ended.

David stood in the empty apartment and thought about fifteen years. 5,475 days. All of it finite now, countable, diminishing.

He went to the kitchen and made tea. It was what Amara drank when she was stressed, though she rarely let him make it for her. He made it anyway, the way she liked it—strong, no sugar. Left it on the counter where she'd find it when she came home.

If she came home.

###

The hours blurred together.

Zara fed Maya lunch. Put her down for a nap. Normal routine in an abnormal day. Maya resisted, overstimulated by her parents' distress, but finally fell asleep clutching her favorite stuffed elephant.

Zara stood in the doorway of Maya's bedroom, watching her daughter sleep. She looked so small in the bed they'd bought her last month—a "big girl bed" because she was growing up so fast.

Growing into a future that didn't exist.

"We should leave Lagos," Kwame said quietly behind her. "Go to Antarctica maybe. Somewhere safer."

"Safer from what? An asteroid?"

"From the chaos that's coming. There's already rioting in some cities. If this gets worse—"

"It will get worse. Where are we going to go that's safe from the end of the world?"

Kwame had no answer.

Zara's comm chimed repeatedly. Messages flooding in—friends, colleagues, family, everyone reaching out or breaking down or asking questions she couldn't answer.

One message made her pause. Professor Wei, her elderly neighbor.

*Come over when you can. Bring Maya. Garden is peaceful.*

"Will you watch her?" Zara asked Kwame. "I need to talk to someone."

"Go. I'll be here."

###

David stood at the window of their apartment, looking out at the solar arrays stretching across Antarctica's surface. The sun was fully up now, the panels soaking in light, converting it to power with perfect efficiency.

They'd continue doing that until the moment of impact. The automated systems didn't care about extinction. They'd fulfill their function right up until they were vaporized.

There was something peaceful about that. Something clean.

His supervisor would call a meeting soon. Half the staff wouldn't show up. Some would quit. Some would die. The city would need maintenance anyway, for as long as it lasted.

David thought about Platform 7-Delta. About the connection he'd just replaced. In three months, it would need replacing again. And then another three months. And another. For fifteen years until there was no one left to replace it.

He could just let it fail. The panel would lose efficiency, eventually stop working. The city would have slightly less power. In the grand scheme of extinction, it didn't matter.

But he'd replaced it anyway.

He looked at the tea he'd made for Amara. It was getting cold. She probably wouldn't be home for hours. Maybe days. Maybe she'd disappear into her calculations the way she always did when problems needed solving.

Except this problem couldn't be solved.

David picked up the tea and took a sip. It was bitter and strong, exactly how she liked it. He drank it slowly, standing at the window, watching the city wake to its last fifteen years.

Outside, he could hear voices in the hallway. Someone crying. Someone else shouting. The ambient sound of a world fracturing.

His comm lit up again—messages from colleagues, from his supervisor, from people he hadn't talked to in years. Everyone reaching out. Everyone looking for connection in the face of extinction.

David ignored them and went to clean the apartment. Amara would come home eventually. When she did, she'd be exhausted, devastated, carrying the weight of having detected humanity's end.

He couldn't fix that. Couldn't fix anything.

But he could make the bed. Do the dishes. Have clean towels ready. The small maintenances that made life livable.

It was what he knew how to do.

###

Zara knocked on Professor Wei's door.

The old woman answered almost immediately, as if she'd been waiting. At 114 years old, Wei moved slowly, leaning on her cane, but her eyes were clear and calm.

"Zara. Come in, dear. Maya is sleeping?"

"Yes. I left her with Kwame."

"Then come sit in the garden."

Wei's apartment had a small balcony garden—just ten meters square, but filled with plants and flowers. It smelled like earth and growth. Like life continuing despite everything.

Wei poured tea and they sat together, not speaking at first. Through the railing, Zara could see Lagos District stretching below them—the converted cityscape full of people processing the same impossible news.

"How are you so calm?" Zara asked finally. "Doesn't this terrify you?"

Wei considered the question. "I've been 114 years old for three months. I've known I would die soon for the past decade. Now I learn that you'll die soon too. That everyone will. It's terrible for you, Zara. You're thirty-four. You should have had another lifetime. Maya should have had a full life. That's a real loss, and I'm sorry for it."

"But?"

"But death was always coming. For me, for you, for Maya. We just didn't know when. Now we do. That doesn't change what death is. Only when it arrives."

"That's it? We're all going to die anyway, so this doesn't matter?"

"No. This matters enormously. But not because it makes death real—death was always real. It matters because now everyone knows their time is short. And that changes how we live." Wei gestured at the garden. "These flowers will die this winter. They always do. I plant them anyway. They're beautiful now. That's enough."

"Flowers aren't children."

"No. But the principle is the same. Temporary doesn't mean meaningless. It means precious."

Zara felt tears coming again. "I don't know how to do this. How to live fifteen years knowing it ends. How to watch her grow up knowing she'll never be an adult."

Wei took her hand. The touch was light—her old fingers had little strength left. "You'll learn. Not today. But you'll learn. Humans are extraordinary at adaptation. At finding meaning even in impossible situations. You'll find a way."

They sat together in the garden while the world processed its extinction. Zara crying quietly, Wei holding her hand, the flowers blooming in their pots regardless of asteroids or timelines or the end of everything.

Temporary and precious.

That was all anything ever was.

###

Amara came home three days later.

David was in the kitchen when he heard the door. She stood in the doorway like she didn't quite remember how to enter her own apartment.

"I'm sorry," she said. "I couldn't—there was so much—"

"It's okay."

"It's not okay." She walked into the living room and sank onto the couch. "We're all going to die and I can't fix it and I keep running the same calculations hoping for different results but physics doesn't care what I hope—"

David sat beside her. Not too close. They hadn't been close in a long time.

"You can't fix this," he said quietly.

"I know." Her voice broke. "I know that. But I keep trying anyway because what else am I supposed to do?"

She started crying—really crying, not the controlled composure she usually maintained. David pulled her toward him and she came, collapsing against his shoulder in a way she hadn't done in years.

They sat like that for a long time. Not talking. Just holding each other while the world ended around them.

When she finally pulled away, her eyes were red but clearer.

"I found your tea," she said. "On the counter. That first morning."

"I thought you might need it."

"I did." She looked at him—really looked at him, maybe for the first time in months. "Thank you."

"You're welcome."

She left again the next day. Back to the station, back to the futile calculations. He went back to work too. The solar arrays still needed maintenance. The city still needed power.

For fifteen years at least.

David stood on Platform 7-Delta and looked at the panels stretching to the horizon. Thought about the connection he'd replaced on detection day. In three months, it would need replacing again.

He'd replace it then too.

It was what he knew how to do.
