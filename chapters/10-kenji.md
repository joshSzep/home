# Chapter 10 - Kenji

The party has been going for three days.

Kenji Torres wakes up in someone's apartment—he's not sure whose—surrounded by bodies. People passed out on couches, on the floor, tangled together. The air smells like sweat and smoke and chemicals. Bottles everywhere. Pills scattered on tables. Music still playing faintly from speakers in the corner.

He sits up slowly. His head throbs. His mouth tastes like ash.

Someone next to him stirs—a girl, maybe twenty-two, blonde hair matted. She blinks at him. "Hey."

"Hey."

"What time is it?"

Kenji checks his wrist display. "Four in the afternoon."

"What day?"

"Tuesday. I think."

She laughs—a hollow, brittle sound—and closes her eyes again. "Doesn't matter."

No. It doesn't matter.

Nothing matters.

That's the point of these parties. To stop thinking about the asteroid. To stop calculating time remaining. To drown the existential terror in substances and noise and bodies.

Kenji steps over people and finds the bathroom. Looks at himself in the mirror. Twenty-five years old. Eyes bloodshot. Face gaunt. He's lost weight in the six months since he dropped out of his PhD program. Stopped eating regularly. Stopped sleeping normally. Started going to parties like this one.

Started trying to feel anything other than terror.

It's not working.

He splashes water on his face and leaves the apartment without saying goodbye to anyone.

---

Six months ago, he was in the lab with Amara when she discovered the asteroid.

Six months ago, his whole world was trajectory calculations and orbital mechanics and the quiet satisfaction of solving problems that could be solved.

Then the problem became unsolvable.

Fifteen years until extinction. No solutions. No hope. Just math, absolute and indifferent.

Kenji lasted three days after that. Three days of going to classes, sitting in lectures, pretending research mattered. Then he walked out of the university and didn't go back.

His mother was too busy managing city collapse to stop him. Amara was disappointed—he could hear it in her voice when they talked—but she had her own crisis to handle.

So Kenji did what half the young people in Antarctica were doing: tried hedonism.

Parties. Drugs. Alcohol. Sex with strangers whose names he didn't remember. Dancing until dawn. Sleeping through days. Waking up and doing it again.

Trying to escape the countdown.

Trying to feel something other than dread.

But six months in, he feels nothing.

Just hollow. Just numb. Just wasted.

---

He wanders through the Antarctica district where he grew up. The megacity looks different now. Emptier. Some buildings abandoned. Some systems failing. Graffiti everywhere—messages of rage, despair, defiance. FOURTEEN YEARS LEFT. NOTHING MATTERS. FUCK THE ASTEROID. WE'RE ALREADY DEAD.

The streets are quieter than they used to be. Some people fled—trying to outrun death, as if location mattered. Others died—suicide mostly, though some violence, some accidents. The rest are trying to survive.

Or trying to forget.

Kenji passes three different parties happening in street-level apartments. Midday parties. Endless parties. The hedonism economy is booming—drugs, alcohol, entertainment, anything to numb the terror.

He could join any of them. Could disappear into another three-day binge.

Instead, he keeps walking.

He finds himself at the Nature Preserve District—one of the megacity's achievements, massive enclosed ecosystems maintaining pre-Forever Earth biodiversity. He and his mother used to come here when he was a child. She'd point out species, tell him their names, explain their ecological relationships.

Before she became Mayor. Before everything fell apart.

Kenji sits on a bench near an artificial waterfall. Watches the water cycle through filtration systems. Watches engineered birds fly between engineered trees. Everything here is maintained. Everything artificial. Everything temporary.

In fifteen years, this will all be gone. The birds, the trees, the water, the systems that sustain them.

Him.

His mother.

Everyone.

He thinks: I've wasted six months trying to escape this thought. How many more months will I waste? How many of my fifteen years will I spend numb and hollow?

The question sits in his chest, heavy and urgent.

---

That night, Kenji goes to see his mother.

Elena Torres is in her office—where else?—surrounded by screens showing city systems, crisis reports, resource allocation models. She looks exhausted. More than exhausted. Hollowed out.

"Kenji." She stands when he enters. "I didn't know you were coming."

"Neither did I."

They hug awkwardly. They haven't been close in months. She's been buried in managing collapse. He's been buried in parties and oblivion. Two different strategies for the same terror.

"How are you?" she asks.

"Terrible. You?"

"Same." She gestures at the screens. "Birth rates collapsed. Suicide rates climbing. Infrastructure failing faster than we can maintain it. Wars breaking out globally. I'm supposed to govern this. Make it orderly. Keep people alive." She laughs bitterly. "For what? So they can die in fourteen years instead of now?"

Kenji has never heard his mother sound like this. Elena Torres, the pragmatic leader. The steady hand. The woman who always had a plan.

She sounds broken.

"Are you okay?" he asks.

"No. But I show up anyway. Because what else is there?" She looks at him. "What about you? I heard you've been... partying."

"Trying to escape. Didn't work."

"Did you think it would?"

"I didn't think. I just—I couldn't be in that lab anymore. Couldn't calculate orbits and trajectories when none of it matters. Couldn't pretend research had a future."

Elena sits down heavily. "Nothing has a future. But we're alive now. That's something, isn't it?"

"Is it? Is being alive now enough when we know exactly how it ends?"

"I don't know." She rubs her eyes. "I'm trying to figure that out. Trying to lead people through this. Trying to find meaning in maintaining systems that will fail anyway. Some days I think I'm succeeding. Most days I think I'm just stalling."

They sit in silence. Mother and son, both drowning, neither knowing how to save the other.

Finally, Kenji says, "I want to leave."

Elena looks up sharply. "Leave where?"

"Antarctica. Travel. Find people who have answers. Or at least different questions. I can't stay here. Can't party myself to death. Can't pretend university matters. I need—I need to find something. Some way to live these fifteen years that isn't numbing out."

"Where would you go?"

"I don't know. Lagos, maybe. Mumbai. Jerusalem. Wherever people are still trying to make sense of this. Wherever there are philosophers or spiritual leaders or just people living differently than we're living here."

Elena's face closes. "It's not safe. The world's fracturing. Wars, collapse, violence."

"Nowhere's safe. We're all dying anyway."

"I don't want to lose you before the asteroid."

"You're losing me here, Mom. I'm wasting away in parties. At least if I'm traveling, I'm searching for something. At least I'm trying."

She's quiet for a long time. Kenji can see the conflict in her face. The mother wanting to protect her son. The leader knowing she can't control everything. The human realizing control was always an illusion.

"Okay," she says finally. "Go. Find what you need to find. But Kenji—" She takes his hand. "Come back. Eventually. Don't die alone somewhere far from home. We have fifteen years. I want to spend some of them together."

"I will. I promise. But I have to do this."

"I know."

They embrace—a real embrace this time. He feels her shaking slightly. Realizes she's crying.

"I love you," he says.

"I love you too. Be careful. And Kenji? Find something worth finding."

---

Two weeks later, Kenji leaves Antarctica.

He takes almost nothing. Backpack with clothes. Some credits. His wrist display. That's it. Everything else stays behind. His apartment. His books. His research. His former life.

The transport to Lagos takes fourteen hours. The infrastructure is degrading—flights less frequent, systems less reliable. But enough still functions. For now.

He arrives in Lagos in the middle of the night. The megacity is different from Antarctica. Warmer, more chaotic, more alive. The streets are crowded even at 2am. Markets still operating. Music playing. People living loudly.

Kenji finds a hostel and collapses into sleep.

The next morning, he starts asking questions.

Where are the philosophers? The spiritual teachers? The people who know how to live with death?

People point him in different directions. A Buddhist temple in the Lekki District. A humanist community center. A Catholic church that's still operating. A group of Sufi mystics meeting in someone's apartment.

Kenji visits all of them.

The Buddhist monks tell him about impermanence and non-attachment. The humanists talk about creating meaning in a meaningless universe. The Christians offer salvation through faith. The Sufis speak of surrender and divine love.

Everyone has a different answer.

No one has *the* answer.

But Kenji keeps asking. Keeps listening. Keeps searching.

---

Three months into his travels, he meets a woman in a Lagos market who changes his trajectory.

She's maybe forty, selling water purification tablets. They start talking—he's buying supplies, she's curious about the young man with the haunted eyes.

"You're searching for something," she says. Not a question.

"How can you tell?"

"You have the seeker look. My son had it too. Before he killed himself six months ago."

"I'm sorry."

She shrugs. "We all die soon anyway. He just chose sooner. I'm not sure I blame him." She packages his tablets. "What are you seeking?"

"I don't know. A way to live fifteen years. A reason to be awake instead of numb. Meaning, maybe."

"You should talk to Professor Wei."

"Who?"

"An old woman. Philosopher. Lives in the Yaba District. She's ancient—one hundred fifteen, maybe sixteen. Very wise. People come to her garden seeking answers. She doesn't give answers exactly. But she helps you find better questions."

Kenji takes the address.

---

Professor Wei's house is small, in a quiet neighborhood. The garden is immaculate—flowers, vegetables, a lemon tree heavy with fruit.

The old woman sits on a bench, impossibly small and frail, watching a child play near the lemon tree. The child is maybe four—running in circles, laughing, utterly absorbed in the simple act of playing.

Kenji approaches carefully. "Professor Wei?"

She looks up. Her face is deeply lined but her eyes are sharp. "Yes?"

"My name is Kenji Torres. Someone told me you might... that you speak with people who are trying to make sense of this."

"The asteroid?"

"Yes."

"Sit." She gestures at the bench.

The child—a little girl—runs over. "Grandmother Wei, who's that?"

"A young man seeking wisdom," Wei says gently. "Go play, Maya. Your mother will call you soon."

The girl runs back to the lemon tree.

Wei turns to Kenji. "What do you want to know?"

"How do you live fifteen years? How do you make them matter? How do you not waste them?"

"What have you been doing?"

"Partying. Drugs. Trying to numb everything. It didn't work. So now I'm traveling. Asking questions. Looking for teachers."

"And what have you learned?"

"That everyone has a different answer. That no one really knows. That I'm still just as lost as when I started."

Wei smiles. "Good. You're learning that seeking outside yourself won't give you what you need. The answers aren't out there. They're in here." She taps her chest. "You have to make your own meaning. No one can give it to you."

"But I don't know how."

"Neither does anyone else. We're all making it up as we go. The asteroid just forced us to admit it. Before, we could pretend life had inherent meaning. Now we can't. So we have to create it. Consciously. Deliberately. That's harder but more honest."

The little girl—Maya—is singing to herself now. A made-up song about lemons.

"She's beautiful," Kenji says.

"Yes. She'll die at seventeen. Her mother knows this. Still loves her completely. Still raises her with hope. That's meaning-making. Choosing to love what you'll lose."

Kenji feels something crack in his chest. "How do you do that? How do you love when you know it ends?"

"How did you love before? Everything you ever loved was going to end. Your parents will die. Your friends will die. You will die. The asteroid just made the timeline visible. But love was always temporary. You loved anyway. You can still love anyway."

He starts crying. Not the numb, hollow feeling from the past six months. Real tears. Real grief. Real presence.

Wei sits with him. Says nothing. Just present.

After a while, Kenji asks, "Can I come back? Learn from you?"

"I don't teach. I'm too old. But you can visit. We can talk. I'll share what I've learned in one hundred sixteen years. You can take what's useful and leave the rest."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. This path is harder than numbing out. Harder than searching for answers outside. You'll have to sit with the grief. With the meaninglessness. With the terror. You'll have to feel all of it. That's the price of being awake."

"I'm tired of being numb."

"Then come back tomorrow. We'll start."

---

Kenji stays in Lagos for three months.

He visits Wei almost daily. Sits in her garden. Listens to her stories. Learns about Buddhism not as religion but as psychological framework. Impermanence. Non-attachment. The nature of suffering and clinging.

He meets Zara—Wei's neighbor, the little girl's mother. Meets her husband Kwame. Meets their baby son Kofi. Sees a family choosing life in the face of death. Sees love happening anyway.

He watches Maya play. Watches her delight in simple things. Watches her live completely in the present because she doesn't yet understand the future.

He learns that meaning isn't found. It's made. Every day. Every moment. In choices about what to value, what to love, what to do with the time that remains.

He learns that numbness was easier but worthless. That presence is harder but real. That grief and joy can coexist. That temporary doesn't mean meaningless.

He doesn't become enlightened. Doesn't stop being scared. Doesn't find the perfect answer.

But he learns to sit with the questions without drowning in them.

He learns to be awake.

Six months after leaving Antarctica, Kenji writes to his mother.

*Mom,*

*I'm in Lagos. I've been learning from a philosopher here—Professor Wei. She's the wisest person I've ever met. She doesn't have answers, but she has tools. Ways of thinking. Ways of being present.*

*I'm not fixed. I still don't know how to spend fifteen years. But I'm not numb anymore. I'm awake. I'm here. I'm learning.*

*I'll come home eventually. Not yet. But eventually. I want to spend some of our remaining time together.*

*I love you. Thank you for letting me go.*

*Kenji*

Elena writes back immediately.

*Kenji,*

*I'm so glad you're okay. I worry about you constantly, but I'm glad you're finding something.*

*Take the time you need. Find what you need to find. I'll be here.*

*The city is falling apart, but I'm still showing up. Professor Wei is right—we make meaning where we can. Mine is here, trying to keep systems running. Yours is somewhere else right now. That's okay.*

*Come home when you're ready.*

*I love you.*

*Mom*

Kenji sits in Wei's garden reading the message. Maya is playing nearby. Kofi is learning to walk. The lemon tree is in bloom.

Temporary. All of it. Ending soon.

But here now. Real now. Mattering now.

He's still searching. Still learning. Still figuring out how to live fifteen years.

But he's not numb anymore.

That's something.

That's enough for today.
