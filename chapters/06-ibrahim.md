# Chapter 6 - Ibrahim

The alert came during evening prayers.

Ibrahim al-Rashid knelt with his brothers in the militia camp, forehead pressed to the prayer mat, reciting the words he'd spoken five times daily since childhood. *Allahu Akbar.* God is greatest. The words were automatic now, worn smooth by repetition, but they still meant everything. They were his foundation, his purpose, his certainty in an uncertain world.

The commander's voice interrupted them mid-prayer. "Brothers. There's been an emergency broadcast. Everyone to the command tent. Now."

Ibrahim finished his prostration—you didn't interrupt prayers for anything less than immediate danger—then rose with the others. Around him, fighters exchanged confused glances. Emergency broadcast from whom? The UN? Some regional power? Nothing interrupted prayers.

They gathered in the command tent, thirty fighters from his unit, all young men like himself. The oldest was twenty-five. The youngest, Ahmed, was seventeen. They'd been preparing for a raid on a Christian militia position scheduled for tomorrow. Standard operation. They'd done dozens like it.

The commander pulled up the broadcast on a battered screen.

Extinction-level asteroid detected. Impact probability 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years. Deflection not possible.

Ibrahim stared at the screen. Read the words again. They were in Arabic, overlaid on images of trajectories and impact projections. The asteroid would hit somewhere in the Pacific. The resulting explosion would be catastrophic. Global extinction within months of impact.

Fifteen years.

"Is this real?" someone asked.

"The UN Monitoring Network confirmed it," the commander said. His voice was steady, but Ibrahim could see the tension in his jaw. "Multiple independent verifications. It's real."

Silence in the tent. Thirty fighters processing the same impossible information.

Ahmed, the seventeen-year-old, spoke up. His voice cracked. "Is this... is this Allah's will?"

The commander looked at him, then at all of them. "Everything is Allah's will."

The answer should have been comforting. Ibrahim had heard it his entire life. Everything happened according to God's plan. Human understanding was limited. Allah saw what they could not see.

But if this was Allah's will, what did it mean?

"Why?" Ibrahim heard himself ask. "Why would Allah—"

"We don't question Allah's wisdom," the commander said sharply. Then, softer: "This may be a test. Or judgment. Or part of a plan beyond our understanding. The imam will guide us."

They went to find the imam—the elderly spiritual leader who'd blessed Ibrahim when he joined the militia three years ago. He was in his tent, already deep in prayer, the broadcast playing on his own screen.

When he finally rose, his face was grave but calm.

"Brothers," he said. "What we have learned today is difficult. But remember: death was always certain. We have always known that we would die. The asteroid changes only the timing. Our faith remains."

"But everyone will die," someone said. "Muslims, Christians, Jews. Everyone. Even the innocent. Even children."

"Allah's justice is perfect," the imam said. "We may not understand it in this life. But in paradise, all will be clear. Those who have faith will be rewarded. Those who died in jihad will have the highest stations. The asteroid does not change this."

Ibrahim wanted to believe him. Needed to believe him. His entire life had been built on the certainty that God was watching, that the struggle mattered, that righteousness would be rewarded.

But a small voice whispered: *If everyone dies, who wins? If the holy land is vaporized, what were we fighting for?*

He pushed the voice away and went back to his tent to pray.

---

Ibrahim prayed for three hours straight.

He prayed the evening prayer he'd interrupted. He prayed additional voluntary prayers. He prostrated himself before Allah and asked for understanding, for faith, for the strength to accept what he couldn't comprehend.

The prayers felt hollow.

Not the words themselves—they were the same words he'd always prayed. But the feeling behind them was different. Usually when he prayed, he felt connected to something vast and certain. Felt the presence of Allah, the rightness of his path, the meaning of his struggle.

Tonight, he felt nothing.

Just his forehead against the mat, his own voice in his ears, and a terrible silence where God's presence should have been.

He finished the prayers mechanically and sat back on his heels. Outside the tent, he could hear his brothers talking in low voices. Some angry. Some confused. Some crying.

The camp was fracturing.

Ibrahim stood and walked out into the night. The Jerusalem hills stretched around him, ancient and contested. His people had lived here for generations, been displaced, fought to return, fought to stay. This land was sacred. Worth dying for. Worth killing for.

In fifteen years, it would be rubble and ash like everywhere else.

What had they been fighting for?

---

The raid went ahead the next day.

Momentum. Routine. Orders already given. Ibrahim strapped on his gear, checked his weapon, moved through the pre-combat rituals with automatic precision.

Some of the fighters had deserted in the night. Just left. Where they went, Ibrahim didn't know. But the camp was quieter, emptier.

Those who remained loaded into the transport. The ride to the Christian militia position was tense and silent. Usually before a raid there was nervous energy, jokes to cut the tension, prayer. Today there was nothing.

They hit the position at dawn.

The fighting was brief and brutal. The Christians were as disorganized as Ibrahim's own unit—the asteroid had broken everyone. Some fought with desperate fury. Some didn't fight at all, just surrendered or ran.

Ibrahim killed two men. Shot them at close range, watched them fall. He'd killed before. It had always felt justified, necessary, righteous. He was defending the holy land. Fighting for Allah. The men he killed were the enemy, had killed his brothers, threatened his people.

Today it felt different.

Today it felt meaningless.

After the raid, Ibrahim searched one of the bodies—standard procedure, looking for intelligence. The man had been young, maybe twenty. Palestinian Christian, based on the medallion around his neck.

Prayer beads.

The Christian had been praying too.

Ibrahim stared at the beads in his hand. This man had believed he was righteous. Had believed God was on his side. Had fought and died for his faith just like Ibrahim was fighting for his.

Now he was dead, and Ibrahim was alive, and in fifteen years they'd both be dead anyway along with everyone else.

Who had been right? Who had God favored?

Or had God been watching at all?

Ibrahim dropped the beads and walked away. Found a place behind the transport and vomited until there was nothing left.

---

Three months passed.

The fighting intensified. That was the paradox: knowing the world would end made the holy land wars more vicious, not less. Every faction fighting harder, more desperately, as if winning the land before the asteroid came would somehow matter.

Ibrahim fought because he didn't know what else to do. Fighting was his identity. He was a soldier. A jihadist. A defender of the faith. Without that, who was he?

But the certainty was gone.

He still prayed five times a day, still followed the rituals, still recited the words. But the hollow feeling remained. He was going through motions, following patterns worn into his life by years of practice.

The doubt grew louder.

He watched his imam give increasingly convoluted explanations for how the asteroid fit into Allah's plan. Watched some brothers cling to faith even harder, while others drifted away. Watched the holy land continue to bleed over ground that would be vaporized.

Six months after the detection, Ibrahim killed another Christian fighter.

Afterward, he searched the body again. Found another medallion. Another set of prayer beads.

This time he kept them.

That night, alone in his tent, Ibrahim held both sets of beads—his own Muslim prayer beads and the Christian ones from the man he'd killed. He tried to pray.

The words wouldn't come.

Instead, he thought: *We both believed. We both prayed. We both thought God was watching, keeping score, judging righteousness. We killed each other over land that will be destroyed, following faiths that gave us different certainties about the same God.*

*And in fifteen years, none of it will matter.*

The thought was terrifying. It threatened everything Ibrahim had built his life on. Without faith, without certainty, without the holy struggle, what was left?

But he couldn't push it away anymore.

The doubt had won.

Ibrahim sat in his tent, holding two sets of prayer beads, and felt his foundation crumble.

Not dramatically. Not all at once. Just quietly, like sand running through his fingers.

He still couldn't leave the militia. Still couldn't stop fighting. It was all he knew. All he had.

But the certainty was gone.

And without certainty, faith was just hope wearing armor.

---

Year one became year two. The holy lands burned.

Factions that had been fighting for generations fought even harder now, with the desperate intensity of people who knew it was all ending. Christians and Muslims and Jews killing each other over Jerusalem, over Bethlehem, over land soaked in blood and theology.

Ibrahim fought with them, but he was hollowing out inside.

He stopped going to the imam for guidance. The explanations had become absurd—the asteroid was a test, a purification, a sorting of the righteous from the damned. But everyone was dying. The righteous and the damned, the faithful and the atheists, the fighters and the children.

If this was Allah's plan, it was incomprehensible.

If it wasn't Allah's plan, then what was Ibrahim fighting for?

He started having conversations with fighters from other units. Found that many felt the same way—going through motions, following momentum, unable to either fully believe or fully leave.

One night, he was on watch when a young fighter approached him. New recruit, barely sixteen.

"Brother Ibrahim," the boy said. "Can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"Do you still believe? That we're fighting for Allah? That paradise waits for martyrs?"

Ibrahim looked at the boy's face—young, uncertain, desperate for certainty.

He could lie. Give the expected answer. Say yes, of course, our faith remains, Allah is just, paradise awaits.

Instead, he said: "I don't know anymore."

The boy stared at him. "But... you've been fighting for three years. You've killed for Allah. You've—"

"I've killed men who believed they were fighting for God too," Ibrahim said quietly. "I've killed Christians who prayed just like we pray. Who died believing they were righteous just like we believe we're righteous. And in fifteen years we'll all be dead anyway, and I don't know what any of it means."

The boy looked stricken. "Then why do you keep fighting?"

Ibrahim didn't have an answer.

He kept fighting because it was what he did. Because he didn't know how to be anything else. Because stopping would mean facing the void where his faith used to be, and he wasn't ready for that.

But he didn't say any of that.

"I don't know," he admitted. "I don't know why I keep fighting. But I don't know how to stop either."

The boy left. Deserted the camp that night.

Ibrahim didn't blame him.

---

Three years after the detection, a stranger arrived in the camp.

Not a fighter. A traveler—young, maybe mid-twenties, with mixed features and an outsider's manner. He was staying in a refugee camp nearby, the commander said. Philosopher or seeker or something. Asking questions about faith and meaning.

Ibrahim found him one evening, sitting at the edge of the camp, watching the sunset over Jerusalem.

"You're the one asking questions," Ibrahim said.

The stranger looked up. "Kenji Torres. And yes, I ask a lot of questions."

"Do you get answers?"

"Not really. But I'm trying." Kenji gestured at the space beside him. "You can sit if you want."

Ibrahim sat. They watched the sunset in silence for a while.

"You're a fighter," Kenji said eventually. Not a question.

"Yes."

"Do you believe in what you're fighting for?"

The question should have been offensive. Should have triggered Ibrahim's training—defend the faith, defend the cause, defend the certainty.

Instead, he said: "I used to."

Kenji didn't look surprised. "What changed?"

"The asteroid. Everyone's going to die. Muslims, Christians, Jews, everyone. If Allah wanted to punish unbelievers, why kill believers too? If this is judgment, who's being judged? If it's a test, what are we being tested for?" Ibrahim heard the questions tumbling out, questions he'd been holding for three years. "I've killed men who prayed to God just like I do. Killed them believing I was righteous. Now I don't know if any of it meant anything."

"Maybe it didn't," Kenji said quietly.

Ibrahim waited for anger at those words. It didn't come. Just exhaustion.

"Then what do I do?" he asked. "This is all I am. A fighter. A believer. Without that, I'm nothing."

"I don't know." Kenji smiled sadly. "I've spent three years traveling, asking that same question. How do you live fifteen years when nothing means what you thought it meant? I haven't found an answer yet. But I've found people trying. Different ways of making meaning when the old meanings break."

Ibrahim thought about the prayer beads in his tent. Christian and Muslim. Both useless. Both precious.

"I'm tired," he admitted. "Tired of fighting. Tired of pretending I still believe. But I don't know how to stop."

"Then don't," Kenji said. "Not yet. But maybe start asking what comes after. What you'd be if you weren't a fighter. Who you'd be if you weren't certain."

They sat together watching darkness fall over the holy land, two seekers with different questions but the same emptiness.

Ibrahim went back to his tent that night and prayed.

Not because he believed God was listening.

But because the words were familiar, and he didn't know what else to do yet.

Someday, he thought, he'd figure out how to stop.

But not today.

The fighting would continue. The doubts would grow.

And in twelve years, none of it would matter anyway.
