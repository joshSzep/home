# Chapter 17 - Elena

The office is almost empty.

Mayor Elena Torres sits at the council table where thirty department heads used to gather for morning briefings. Now there are three people: Marcus, her assistant who stayed for reasons she still doesn't fully understand. Chen, the infrastructure coordinator, who looks ten years older than she did last year. And Elena herself.

Five years after the detection. Ten years until impact.

The city is falling apart slowly. Not collapsing—that would be too dramatic, too final. Just... degrading. Fraying. Unraveling thread by thread.

"Infrastructure report," Elena says, maintaining the ritual even though it feels absurd.

Chen pulls up data. "Power grid at 54% capacity. Water at 69%. Transport at 31% and dropping. We've lost another 200 maintenance workers this quarter. Some to death, some to desertion. The automated systems are holding most infrastructure together, but manual repairs are becoming impossible."

"Food supplies?"

"Four months of reserves. Shipments from agricultural zones are irregular at best. Global supply chains are fragmented. We're rationing, but people ignore the rations. What are we going to do, arrest them?"

"Population?"

Marcus answers. "Two million remaining. Down from four million at detection. Birth rate effectively zero. Death rate climbing. Five hundred confirmed deaths last month. Mostly suicide, some violence, some natural."

Elena nods. She expected this. Has been watching the slow exodus for five years. People leaving, dying, giving up.

She can't blame them.

"Anything else?"

Silence.

"Thank you. Same time tomorrow."

They file out. Elena sits alone in the empty council chamber.

She's been Mayor for eight years. Fought for this position. Wanted to lead, to serve, to make a difference.

Now she governs ruins.

Now she shows up every day to an office where almost no one comes. Signs documents that barely matter. Makes decisions that won't outlast her.

Why does she keep doing this?

---

Kenji finds her in her office that afternoon.

Her son—thirty-nine years old now, back from his years of traveling. He looks different than when he left. Calmer. More centered. Less desperate.

"Mom. Have you eaten today?"

Elena looks up from the report she's reading. Population projections for Year 12. "I had coffee."

"That's not food." He sets down a container. "I brought lunch from the community kitchen. Eat."

"You're taking care of me now?"

"Someone has to. You take care of everyone else."

Elena opens the container. Some kind of grain bowl. She's not hungry, but she eats anyway because Kenji is watching with that concerned-son look.

"How are you?" she asks.

"Better than I was. Professor Wei's teachings help. I meditate now. Try to stay present. Try not to drown in the future that isn't coming." He sits across from her. "How are you?"

"Tired."

"Why do you keep doing this? The governance? Everyone knows there's no real authority left. The systems run on automation. Why show up every day?"

It's the same question Ibrahim asked her last week. The former fighter, wounded and questioning, now living in Antarctica. Why do you still do this job?

Elena doesn't have a good answer.

"Because someone should," she says finally. "Because if everyone gives up, what do we have? Because maintaining dignity matters even when nothing else does. Because—" She stops. "I don't know, Kenji. Maybe I'm just going through motions. Maybe it's habit. Maybe it's denial. But I show up. I keep the office open. I sign the documents. I mediate when people ask. And somehow that feels better than not doing it."

"Is it duty?"

"Maybe. Or maybe it's the only meaning I have left. Lead until I can't. Serve until it doesn't matter. Bear witness to the end. That's all I have."

Kenji is quiet for a moment. Then: "Professor Wei would say that's enough. That showing up with integrity is intrinsically valuable. Not because it changes anything. Just because it's who you are."

"Professor Wei is very wise."

"She is. You should read her letters again. They help."

After Kenji leaves, Elena pulls up her correspondence with Wei. Years of letters. Wisdom from a woman who lived one hundred twenty-six years and died last year, before the asteroid.

Wei's death affected Elena more than she expected. They'd never met in person. Just letters. But Wei had been her teacher, her guide, her anchor.

The last letter Wei sent, hand shaking, barely legible:

*Don't grieve me long. I don't want grief. I want gratitude. For one hundred twenty-three years. For teaching until I couldn't. For loving until the end.*

*Be well, Elena. Be present. Be human.*

Elena reads it again. Feels tears coming. Pushes them down.

She has work to do. Even if it doesn't matter. Especially then.

The Annual Founders Day ceremony is in two weeks.

It's an Antarctica tradition—celebrating the founding of the megacity, honoring the vision of Forever Earth, marking humanity's commitment to this planet.

Used to draw millions. Politicians, celebrities, performances, speeches. The biggest event of the year.

Elena's staff tells her: don't bother. No one will come. No one cares about Founders Day when everyone knows there's no future.

Elena schedules it anyway.

"Madam Mayor," Marcus says carefully. "Are you sure? We'll prepare the plaza, set up the stage, arrange security. For maybe a hundred people?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because it's Founders Day. Because we've celebrated it for eighty years. Because maintaining tradition matters even when—especially when—tradition is ending."

Marcus doesn't argue. He knows better.

---

Founders Day arrives.

The plaza can hold half a million people. Today, maybe two hundred attend. Elena sees Kenji in the small crowd. A few old staffers. Some citizens who still cling to ritual. Some who came out of curiosity or pity.

The stage looks absurd. Massive screens for a crowd that doesn't exist. Sound systems for an audience that isn't listening.

Elena walks to the podium.

Should she cancel? Should she admit this is pointless? Should she abandon the ceremony and go home?

No.

She's here. They're here. Founders Day happens.

"Citizens of Antarctica," she begins. Her voice carries across the nearly empty plaza. "Eighty-three years ago, our founders declared that humanity would remain on Earth. That we would not flee to the stars. That we would build civilization here, on this planet, forever."

A few people laugh bitterly at "forever."

Elena continues. "Forever, it turns out, is ninety-eight years. Eighty-three already passed. Fifteen remaining. Our founders built for permanence. We face impermanence."

She looks at the small crowd. Sees Kenji watching her with love and concern. Sees Marcus standing at the side, loyal despite everything. Sees strangers who came for reasons she'll never know.

"But their vision wasn't false," she says. "They believed in collective action. In cooperation. In building something together. That vision doesn't disappear because the timeline shortened. We're still here. Still building, maintaining, living together. For ten more years, we'll do this. And that matters."

She pauses. Feels emotion rising. Pushes through it.

"I know many of you think this ceremony is absurd. That maintaining traditions is pointless when everything ends. Maybe you're right. But I believe showing up matters. Remembering who we were matters. Honoring what we built matters. Not because it lasts. But because we're still here. Because being human means creating meaning even when meaning seems impossible."

She looks out at the tiny crowd in the massive plaza.

"Thank you for coming. Thank you for being here. Thank you for choosing to witness this moment with me."

She steps down. A few people applaud. Most just watch silently.

Afterward, an old staffer—someone who's been with the city government for forty years—approaches her.

"Thank you, Madam Mayor."

"For what?"

"For still showing up. For maintaining dignity. For remembering. It helps."

Elena cries in her office afterward. Alone. Deep, wrenching sobs.

Not from sadness exactly. From exhaustion. From the weight of carrying something no one else wants to carry. From the absurdity of it all.

But also: from gratitude. That someone said thank you. That it helped somebody.

That maybe, just maybe, showing up matters.

---

Six months later, Ibrahim comes to her office.

The former fighter walks with a limp now—permanent injury from combat. He's been in Antarctica for three years, adjusting to life without fighting, without faith, without certainty.

They've developed an unlikely friendship. The secular humanist mayor and the ex-Muslim fighter. Both struggling with duty without purpose.

"Madam Mayor," he says. "Can we talk?"

"Always. Sit."

He sits carefully, favoring his injured leg. "I've been thinking about why we keep doing this. You with governance. Me with—whatever I'm doing. Maintenance work. Helping at the community kitchen. Small things that don't matter."

"And?"

"I talked to Kenji about it. He shared Professor Wei's teachings. She said something that helps: we're not doing this because it changes outcomes. We're doing it because doing it with integrity is intrinsically valuable."

"I've been telling myself that for five years."

"Do you believe it?"

Elena thinks about it. Does she believe showing up matters? Does she believe governance without power is still meaningful?

"Some days," she admits. "Some days I believe it completely. That maintaining order, mediating disputes, keeping records—all of it matters because being human means organizing ourselves, even at the end. Other days I think I'm delusional. That I'm just going through motions because I don't know how to stop."

"That's how I feel about faith," Ibrahim says quietly. "Some days I think maybe meaning exists without God. That humans create it through action, through choice. Other days I think we're just animals pretending. Making up stories to feel less scared."

"And today?"

"Today I think maybe both are true. Maybe we're making it up. But making it up with integrity is better than making it up with cruelty. You could have fled. Could have abandoned this position. Could have spent five years seeking pleasure or numbing out. Instead you showed up every day, trying to help people, trying to maintain some dignity. Even if it's made up—it's made up well."

Elena feels something loosen in her chest. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For understanding. For keeping me company in this absurdity. For showing up too."

They sit together in silence. The ex-mayor and the ex-fighter. Both still showing up. Both still trying. Both still making meaning where meaning seems impossible.

It's not much.

But it's something.

---

That night, Elena reads old documents.

The founding charter of Antarctica. Declarations from the Forever Earth movement. Speeches about humanity's commitment to staying, to building, to lasting.

*We will endure,* they said. *We will persist. We will build forever.*

Forever, it turns out, is ninety-eight years.

She starts laughing. Can't help it. The irony is too perfect. They built for eternity. Got a century.

Kenji finds her laughing in her office at midnight.

"Mom? Are you okay?"

"We built forever," she manages between laughs. "Forever is five years."

He stares at her. Then he starts laughing too.

They laugh together until they're crying. Laugh-crying at the absurdity. At the tragedy. At the beautiful, stupid, human desire to build permanent things in an impermanent universe.

When they've both calmed down, Kenji says, "Professor Wei would say the mistake was thinking forever meant eternal. Forever is just: while we're here."

"She's right. She's always right."

"Are you okay?"

Elena wipes her face. Looks at her son—thirty-nine years old, transformed by grief and seeking, now here with her, helping her, being present.

"I wasted so much time on power," she says. "On trying to control things. On believing leadership meant having answers. I could have spent more time with you. With your father before he died. With being instead of doing."

"You're here now."

"We have five years left."

"Then let's not waste them. I'm here. I'm helping. We'll do this together. Not because it changes anything. Just because we can. Because being together is better than being alone."

Elena pulls him into a hug. Holds her son. Her remaining family. Her witness.

"Thank you for coming home."

"Thank you for letting me leave. For letting me find my way back."

They sit together in her office, surrounded by documents about forever, living in the remnants of permanence.

Five years left.

Then four years, eleven months.

Then four years, ten months.

The countdown continues.

Elena continues with it.

Not leading anymore—not really. Just bearing witness. Just showing up. Just being present with dignity.

Wei was right: it's enough.

It has to be enough.

Because it's all there is.
