# Chapter 12 - David

The platform is 200 meters above the ice.

David Chen stands at the edge of the maintenance platform, looking down. His safety harness is clipped to the rail, but he could unclip it. Could step off. Could fall.

Would take maybe seven seconds to hit the ground. Less if the wind was right.

Seven seconds and it would be over.

No more asteroid. No more watching the world die slowly. No more coming home to an empty apartment where his wife sleeps but doesn't live.

Seven seconds.

He stands there for fifteen minutes, calculating. Terminal velocity. Wind resistance. Angle of impact. His engineer brain can't help but analyze, even in this.

Then he steps back from the edge, clips back to the safety rail, and returns to work.

Not because he wants to live. Not because he has hope.

Just because: what's the difference?

Jump now, die later. Both end the same way. Might as well finish the maintenance cycle.

The solar panel needs realignment. The connection joints need lubrication. The automated monitoring system is flagging a potential fault in section 7-B.

David does the work mechanically. Precisely. The way he's done it for eight years.

The way he'll keep doing it until the asteroid arrives.

Because what else is there?

---

One year after the detection, David's maintenance division has lost half its workforce.

Some quit. Some fled Antarctica. Some died—suicides mostly, though a few accidents. When you stop caring whether you live, accidents become more likely.

David keeps showing up.

His supervisor—a woman named Rodriguez who looks like she's aged ten years in twelve months—asks him during a shift: "Why are you still here?"

"Where else would I be?"

"Anywhere. Doing anything. This work doesn't matter anymore. The arrays will function for fifteen years and then they'll be vaporized. What's the point of maintaining them?"

David adjusts a connection joint. Checks the voltage readings. "The point is they need maintaining."

"That's not a reason."

"It's the only reason I have."

Rodriguez is quiet for a moment. Then: "I'm quitting next week. Going to travel. See the world before it ends. You should too."

"I'm not a traveler."

"Then what are you?"

David doesn't have an answer. He's not anything anymore. Just someone who shows up, does work, goes home. Repeat.

Rodriguez quits the following week. Half the remaining crew follows.

David stays.

---

At home, Amara is never there.

She leaves before dawn, comes back after midnight. Working sixteen-hour days at the monitoring facility. Trying to solve the unsolvable. Calculating trajectories that can't be changed.

David understands. Work is her escape. Numbers don't feel. Numbers don't grieve. Numbers are safe.

But he misses her anyway.

They've been married nine years. Used to talk about having children someday. Used to make plans, dream about futures, laugh together.

Now they're ghosts living in the same apartment.

He tries, occasionally.

"Amara. Do you want dinner?"

"Not hungry. Ate at the facility."

"Should we talk?"

"About what?"

"About us. About this. About—"

"I can't, David. Not now. I have to finish these calculations."

"They don't change anything."

"I know."

"Then why—"

"Because it's all I have. Please. Just... let me work."

So he lets her work. Lets her disappear into equations. Lets the space between them grow.

He doesn't fight it. Doesn't demand connection. Doesn't insist on marriage counseling or date nights or any of the things people do to save relationships.

Because what's the point of saving a marriage when everyone dies in fourteen years?

He just accepts it. Accepts the loneliness. Accepts that they're drowning separately.

Accepts everything.

---

Six months later, David is alone on a platform when he has the thought again.

Jump. Just jump.

It would be so easy. Unclip the harness. Step off. Seven seconds.

He stands at the edge. The wind is sharp today. Below, the ice stretches endlessly. Above, the sky is bright and cold and indifferent.

He thinks about Amara. Whether she'd care if he died. Whether she'd notice. She's so buried in work, so absent, so gone.

Maybe she'd feel relief. One less thing to worry about. One less person to fail to connect with.

He thinks about his parents in Beijing. Dead ten years now. He was an only child. No siblings. No children. No close friends.

If he jumped, who would mourn?

The automated systems would flag the missing worker. A replacement would be assigned. The solar arrays would continue functioning.

That's all.

He stands there for twenty minutes. Calculating. Considering.

Then he steps back.

Not from courage. Not from hope. Not from some revelation about the value of life.

Just from: why bother?

Dying now or dying later—it's the same endpoint. The asteroid is coming. Jumping just moves the date up by fourteen years.

And fourteen years of maintaining solar panels is no worse than seven seconds of falling.

Both meaningless. Both empty. Both just time passing until it stops.

He might as well keep going.

He finishes the maintenance cycle and goes home.

Amara isn't there.

---

Three years after the detection, David realizes something.

He's been working mostly alone now. The maintenance division is down to twenty people for arrays that used to require two hundred. But the work still gets done.

Because the automated systems are taking over.

Robots handle the routine maintenance. AI diagnostic systems flag issues. Self-repairing mechanisms fix minor faults. The solar arrays were designed to be largely autonomous—human oversight was mostly redundant even before the asteroid.

Now the redundancy is obvious.

David works alongside the machines. They don't talk. Don't complain. Don't despair. They just... function.

He finds strange comfort in this.

The robots don't know the world is ending. Or if they do, they don't care. They just execute their programming. Maintain the arrays. Keep the systems running. Do the work because the work exists.

No existential crisis. No meaning-making. No grief.

Just function.

David starts to envy them.

One day, he's realigning a panel with a robotic assistant—a six-armed maintenance unit that's been operating on this sector for years. The robot works with perfect efficiency. No hesitation. No questioning. Just: identify problem, execute solution, move to next task.

"You don't care why, do you?" David says aloud. Not expecting an answer. Just talking to himself.

The robot continues working.

"You don't need a reason. You just maintain the arrays because that's your function. It doesn't matter that they'll be destroyed. It doesn't matter that none of this lasts. You just do the work."

The robot completes its task and moves to the next panel.

David watches it. Thinks: That's the answer. Function without meaning. Work without purpose. Just: do what's in front of you because it's in front of you.

Not enlightenment. Not wisdom.

Just: acceptance of meaningless function.

He finds strange peace in this.

---

Five years after the detection, David and Amara are roommates.

Not married. Not partners. Not even really friends.

Just two people who share an apartment and occasionally see each other in the kitchen.

"Morning," she says when their paths cross.

"Morning."

"Coffee?"

"Yes, please."

They drink coffee in silence. She checks something on her wrist display. He stares out the window at the megacity.

"I'm going to the facility," she says.

"I'm going to the arrays."

"See you tonight."

"Maybe."

She leaves. He finishes his coffee alone.

This is their marriage now. Polite. Distant. Empty.

David doesn't even feel sad about it anymore. Doesn't feel anything really. Just numb acceptance.

They're both surviving. Both functioning. Both going through motions.

That's all.

Ten years left. Then nine years, eleven months. Then nine years, ten months.

Time passing. Both of them waiting.

For what? For death. For the end. For the asteroid to arrive and make all of this irrelevant.

David goes to work. Maintains the arrays. Works alongside robots who don't question why.

Comes home. Eats. Sleeps. Repeats.

This is life now.

Not living. Just: not dying yet.

---

Eight years after the detection, something changes.

David is on a platform doing routine maintenance. The work is automatic now—his hands know what to do without thinking. Adjust, calibrate, test, move on.

A message comes through on his wrist display. From Amara.

That's unusual. They don't message during work hours. Don't message at all, really, except logistics.

He opens it.

*David. Can we talk? Tonight? Please.*

He stares at the message for a long time.

Talk about what? Their dead marriage? The asteroid? The eight years they've wasted being strangers?

He thinks about ignoring it. About coming home late, avoiding the conversation, maintaining the safe distance they've built.

Instead, he replies: *Okay.*

---

When he gets home that evening, Amara is already there.

That alone is shocking. She's never home before midnight.

She's sitting on the couch, hands folded, looking nervous. He hasn't seen her look nervous in years. She's been hollow, exhausted, absent—but not nervous.

"Hi," she says.

"Hi."

"Thank you for coming home. For talking."

"Okay."

She takes a breath. "I wasted eight years."

David doesn't know what to say.

"Eight years," she continues. "I spent them hiding in work. Running calculations that don't matter. Avoiding you. Avoiding everything. And now we have seven years left. Seven years until everyone dies. And I realized..." Her voice breaks. "I don't want to waste them too."

David sits down slowly. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying I'm sorry. I'm saying I was wrong. I'm saying I disappeared into work because I couldn't handle the grief. I couldn't handle having no solution. I couldn't handle being powerless. So I hid. And I left you alone. And I—" She starts crying. "I'm so sorry, David. I'm so sorry I left you."

He's frozen. Hasn't seen her cry in years. Hasn't seen her feel anything in years.

"Why now?" he asks quietly.

"Because I'm tired of being numb. Because my sister is coming to visit in Year 15 with her family, and I realized I have no one to introduce them to. Because I've spent eight years dying slowly and I have seven left and I don't want to spend them alone." She looks at him. "Do you want to spend them alone?"

"I've been spending them alone."

"I know. Because I left. But David—" She reaches for his hand. He lets her take it, too shocked to pull away. "Can we not be alone anymore? Can we try? Can we have seven years together instead of seven years in the same apartment?"

He looks at their hands. Hers is shaking. His is numb.

He thinks about eight years of loneliness. Eight years of parallel drowning. Eight years of going through motions.

He thinks about seven years left.

He thinks: Is it worse to try and fail? Or to not try and definitely fail?

"I don't know how," he admits. "I don't know how to not be numb anymore."

"Me neither. But maybe we can figure it out together."

"What if it's too late? What if we're too broken?"

"Then we're broken together. That's better than being broken alone."

David sits there holding his wife's hand. The woman he married nine years ago. The woman who disappeared into work. The woman who's here now, asking for another chance.

Seven years left.

Not much time. But more than zero.

"Okay," he says quietly. "Let's try."

Amara cries harder. He pulls her into his arms. They hold each other on the couch in their apartment, two people who've been drowning separately, trying to figure out how to swim together.

It's not salvation. It's not a miracle. It's not even hope, really.

It's just: choosing connection instead of isolation.

Choosing to spend the remaining time together instead of alone.

It's a start.

---

One year after the detection—nine years until impact—David finishes his shift and comes home to find Amara already there.

She's made dinner. Actual dinner, not just nutrient bars or facility food.

"Hi," she says. "I'm trying to cook. It's not great, but—"

"It's nice," he says. "Thank you."

They eat together. Really together. Not in silence. Not scrolling through displays. Just: eating, talking, being present.

It's awkward at first. They've forgotten how to do this.

But they keep trying.

After dinner, she says, "Will you show me? Your work? I've never actually seen the solar arrays up close."

"Really? You want to see them?"

"I want to see what you do all day. Want to understand."

So the next day, David takes her up to the platforms.

Two hundred meters above the ice. The arrays stretching endlessly. The automated systems humming. The robotic maintenance units moving between panels.

Amara stands at the rail, looking out. "It's beautiful."

"Is it?"

"Yes. I forgot how beautiful infrastructure could be. I've been staring at data for years. I forgot about the actual physical reality underneath."

David looks at the arrays with new eyes. She's right. They are beautiful. Elegant engineering. Functional art.

He'd stopped noticing years ago.

"Thank you for showing me," she says.

"Thank you for asking."

They stand together on the platform. Holding hands. Two hundred meters up. Seven years left.

It's not enough time.

But it's what they have.

And for the first time in eight years, David feels something other than numb.

He feels present.

Connected.

Alive.

Not much. But more than nothing.

It's a start.
