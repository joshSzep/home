# Chapter 8 - Amara

The numbers don't lie.

Amara has run the calculations forty-seven times. Different approaches, different models, different assumptions. The result is always the same.

The asteroid—officially designated 2025-KT-Alpha in the UN database, though everyone just calls it "the asteroid" now—cannot be stopped. Not with current technology. Not with theoretical technology. Not with anything humans could build in fifteen years.

Physics doesn't care about human survival.

She sits at her workstation in the UN Monitoring Facility, surrounded by screens showing trajectory data, velocity calculations, mass estimates. Around her, the facility that used to house sixty scientists now holds maybe twenty. The rest quit, or died, or simply stopped coming.

Amara comes every day. Sixteen-hour shifts. Sometimes longer.

She doesn't know why anymore.

---

Six weeks after the detection, the UN convened an emergency summit of asteroid defense experts. Amara presented the findings.

The conference room held representatives from every major space-capable nation and corporation. They'd come expecting solutions. Options. A miracle, maybe, wrapped in technical jargon.

Amara gave them the truth.

"The object is 4.7 kilometers in diameter," she said, standing before a room of desperate faces. "Current velocity approximately 31 kilometers per second. Impact probability 99.97%. Time to impact: fourteen years, eleven months, twelve days."

She pulled up the deflection analysis. "To successfully deflect an object of this size and velocity would require changing its trajectory by approximately 0.5 degrees. This sounds small. It is not."

The numbers filled the screen. Energy requirements. Payload masses. Material constraints.

"A kinetic impactor mission—ramming it with spacecraft—would require hitting it with an object massing at least 500,000 tons at high velocity. We've never built anything close to that scale. A nuclear deflection mission would require detonating multiple warheads precisely enough to create asymmetric momentum transfer. Even under optimal conditions, current nuclear yields are insufficient."

She clicked through more slides. Ion beam deflection. Mass driver systems. Solar sails. Gravity tractors. Every theoretical approach humanity had ever conceived.

"None of these can be built, deployed, and executed in the available timeframe. Not with current resource availability. Not with global systems already collapsing. Not even if every nation and corporation devoted all resources to this single goal."

Silence in the room.

The Chinese representative spoke first. "You're saying there's no chance."

"I'm saying the probability of successful deflection with any known or theoretical approach is below 0.1%. Effectively zero."

"Below 0.1% is not zero."

Amara met his eyes. "No. But it's close enough that pursuing it would waste the time we have left."

The room erupted. Shouting, accusations, desperation. Someone called her a defeatist. Someone else said she was giving up. The Russian representative stood and left. The European Space Agency director sat with his head in his hands.

Amara stood at the podium, waiting for the noise to quiet.

Finally, the Secretary General raised his hand. "Dr. Okafor. Are you absolutely certain?"

"Yes."

"Is there any scenario—any at all—where deflection is possible?"

Amara wanted to lie. Wanted to give them hope. But she was a scientist. The numbers were the numbers.

"If we had fifty years instead of fifteen, possibly. If the asteroid were 10% its current mass, possibly. If it had been detected earlier in its trajectory, possibly. But with the actual parameters we face? No. There is no scenario where we survive this."

She pulled up the final slide. Impact simulations. Fireball radius. Shock wave propagation. Global temperature projections.

"Impact will occur in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 2,000 kilometers west of Ecuador. The explosion will be equivalent to roughly 400 million megatons of TNT. Every coastline on Earth will be destroyed by tsunamis within hours. Ejected debris will create an impact winter lasting at least six months. Photosynthesis will cease. The food chain will collapse. Human extinction will follow within 12 to 18 months of impact."

She looked at the assembled representatives. "I'm sorry. But this is what the physics tells us. It cannot be stopped."

The meeting ended shortly after that. No solutions. No hope. Just math.

Amara went back to her workstation and updated the trajectory calculations. 14 years, 11 months, 11 days.

Then 10 days.

Then 9.

The countdown never stopped.

At home, David is cooking dinner.

He still does this—maintains routines, performs small acts of normal life. Dinner at 7pm. Cleaning on Saturdays. Maintenance on his schedule.

Amara comes home at 10pm. The dinner is cold. David is in bed, not sleeping, staring at the ceiling.

She sits on the edge of the bed. "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"Being late. Again."

"It's okay."

"It's not okay."

David rolls over to look at her. His face is tired. They're both tired. "Are you still looking for a solution?"

"No. There is no solution. I'm just... monitoring. Tracking. Updating the calculations."

"Why?"

She doesn't have an answer. Why does she keep working when the work is meaningless? What's the point of tracking an asteroid you can't stop?

"I don't know," she admits.

They lie in silence. She can feel the space between them—physical and emotional. They're married, but barely. They sleep in the same bed but don't touch. They're drowning separately in the same room.

She wants to reach for him. Wants to close the distance. But she's so tired, and she has to be back at the facility by 6am.

"Goodnight," she says.

"Goodnight," David replies.

Neither of them sleeps much.

Three months after the detection, Kenji comes to see her.

He looks terrible. Her former mentee—brilliant, curious, full of potential—looks like he hasn't slept in weeks. His eyes are red. His hands shake.

"Is there any chance?" he asks. "Any at all? Something you haven't told people? Some theoretical approach that might work?"

Amara sits across from him in her office. She could tell him the truth. No chance. Physics is absolute. We're all going to die.

Instead, she hears herself say, "Maybe. We're still looking."

The lie tastes bitter.

Kenji's face lights up with desperate hope. "Really?"

"It's a small chance," she backpedals. "Very small. But we're exploring every option."

"But there's a chance."

"Yes. There's a chance."

He leaves looking slightly less broken. Amara sits at her desk and hates herself.

Why did she lie? To make him feel better? To avoid his grief? Because she can't face her own helplessness?

She pulls up the calculations again. Checks them for the forty-eighth time. The result doesn't change.

No chance. No hope. No solution.

Just math, indifferent and absolute.

---

Six months after the detection, she presents her final report.

The UN Security Council. The Secretary General. Representatives from every major nation. They've been waiting for this—the comprehensive analysis. The definitive answer.

Amara spent six months on this report. Reviewed every theoretical approach. Consulted with every expert still willing to work. Built models, ran simulations, checked and rechecked every assumption.

The conclusion takes five seconds to read.

"It cannot be stopped. No existing or theoretical technology can deflect an object of this size and velocity in this timeframe. I recommend we cease deflection research and dedicate remaining resources to quality of life improvements for the final years."

She watches the faces around the table. Sees hope die in real time. Sees people who've been clinging to maybe, to possibly, to what if, finally confronting the absolute.

The Secretary General is an old man—eighty-six, with two grandchildren who will die as teenagers. He stares at the report for a long time.

Finally, he speaks. "Are you absolutely, completely certain, Dr. Okafor?"

"Yes, sir."

"There is no margin of error? No possibility you've missed something?"

"I've had my findings reviewed by seventeen independent teams across eleven countries. All reached the same conclusion. The laws of physics are not ambiguous."

He nods slowly. "Then we are discussing the end of the human species."

"Yes, sir."

The meeting continues for another hour. Discussion of what to do with the time remaining. Whether to tell the public the truth or maintain false hope. How to allocate resources. Whether to continue space programs, research programs, long-term projects.

Amara barely listens. Her part is done. She gave them the numbers. What they do with the numbers is not her problem.

She goes home at midnight. David is awake, waiting for her.

"Final report?" he asks.

"Yes."

"And?"

"No hope. I made it official."

He pulls her into his arms. She stands stiff for a moment, then collapses into him. The tears come—six months of holding them back, six months of running calculations and maintaining professional detachment, six months of lying to Kenji and others who asked if there was hope.

She cries for an hour. David holds her and says nothing. What is there to say?

When she's cried herself out, she pulls back. "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"For not having an answer. For being the one who tells everyone we're going to die. For—"

"Amara." David's voice is gentle. "It's not your fault. You didn't make the asteroid. You just discovered it. And you told the truth. That's all you could do."

"It's not enough."

"I know. But it's what you have."

They go to bed. She falls asleep in his arms for the first time in months. When she wakes up at 5am, he's already gone—left for his shift on the solar arrays.

She gets ready for work. Updates the countdown. 14 years, 5 months, 23 days.

Then 22 days.

Then 21.

The numbers keep moving. She keeps tracking them. She doesn't know why.

---

One year after the detection, the facility is mostly empty.

Half the staff quit in the first six months. Another quarter died—suicides mostly, though some accidents, some violence. The remainder work sporadic shifts. The systems are mostly automated now. The tracking happens whether humans watch it or not.

Amara still comes every day. Still sits at her station. Still updates calculations that don't need updating.

Her sister Zara calls. "Amara. You need to come visit. Meet your nephew. Kofi is six months old. Maya asks about you all the time."

"I'm working."

"Working on what? You said yourself there's no solution."

"Monitoring. Tracking. Someone needs to maintain the systems."

"The systems are automated. You told me that."

"Someone needs to oversee them."

"Amara." Zara's voice is patient but firm. "You're hiding. You're using work to avoid feeling this. Come to Lagos. Be with family. Please."

"I can't. Not yet."

"When?"

"I don't know."

After the call, Amara sits in the empty facility. Around her, screens show the asteroid's trajectory. Constant, precise, unavoidable.

She pulls up the impact simulation. Watches the asteroid strike the Pacific. Watches the fireball expand. Watches the shockwave ripple across the planet. Watches humanity end.

She's watched this simulation hundreds of times. Refined it, improved it, made it more accurate. She can tell you the exact temperature curve, the precise pressure gradient, the rate of debris dispersal.

She knows exactly how she'll die. Exactly when. Exactly why.

Does that make it better or worse?

She runs the simulation again.

---

Two years after the detection, David stops coming home some nights.

Not infidelity—Amara would almost prefer that. Just: he sleeps at the maintenance facility. Or on the solar platforms. Or somewhere else.

They're still married. Still living together technically. But they're not together.

They're two people drowning separately, too exhausted to reach for each other.

Amara works sixteen-hour days. David works his own long shifts. When they're home together, they move around each other like ghosts. Polite. Distant. Careful not to touch.

She knows she's losing him. Knows she's choosing work over marriage. Knows this is a waste of the time they have left.

But she can't stop.

The calculations are all she has. The only thing that makes sense. Numbers don't lie. Numbers don't feel. Numbers don't ask why.

She just needs to keep calculating. Keep tracking. Keep monitoring.

If she stops, she'll have to feel everything she's been avoiding for two years.

She's not ready.

So she keeps working. Keeps updating coordinates. Keeps refining trajectory models.

13 years left.

Then 12 years, 11 months.

Then 12 years, 10 months.

The countdown continues. She continues with it.

David continues separately.

And the space between them grows.

---

Three years after the detection, Amara sits alone in the monitoring facility at 2am.

The screens glow in the darkness. Trajectory data. Impact projections. Countdown timers.

12 years, 4 months, 17 days.

She realizes she's wasted three years. Three of her fifteen years, spent calculating things that don't need calculating. Tracking an asteroid that cannot be stopped. Hiding from grief behind equations.

She realizes she's losing David. Maybe has already lost him.

She realizes her sister is raising two children in Lagos and Amara hasn't visited once. Hasn't met her nephew in person. Has barely talked to her niece.

She realizes she's spent three years preparing for death and zero time learning how to live with it.

The realization sits in her chest, heavy and painful.

She should leave. Should go home. Should find David and hold him and apologize and reconnect.

Instead, she pulls up the trajectory calculations and checks them again. The forty-thousandth time, maybe. Or more.

The asteroid continues its approach. Constant. Inevitable. Precise.

She continues tracking it.

Because stopping would mean facing everything she's been avoiding.

And she's not ready yet.

She updates the countdown. 12 years, 4 months, 16 days.

The sun rises outside. Another day begins.

Amara keeps working.

What else is there?
