# Chapter 23: Ibrahim

Ibrahim's leg screams when he wakes. It always does—two months since the shrapnel, eight weeks of physical therapy, and still the nerve damage sends fire up his thigh every morning. He lies in the hospital bed, waiting for the pain to settle into something manageable, staring at the white ceiling that's become too familiar.

Year 9. Six years until impact. Twenty-eight years old.

He swings his legs over the edge—slowly, carefully, the left leg cooperating reluctantly. The limp is permanent. The doctors told him weeks ago: combat capability minimal, return to active duty unlikely. They meant: you're done fighting.

They meant: you're not a fighter anymore.

Ibrahim stands—weight on his right leg, partial weight on the left, the cane supporting what his body can't. He's learned this choreography through repetition: stand, balance, breathe, move. Each step deliberate. Each step a negotiation with damaged nerves and shattered identity.

The hospital ward is half-empty now. Twenty beds, twelve occupied. The other wounded fighters are in various stages of healing or not-healing. Some will walk again. Some won't. All of them ended their fighting here—evacuated from conflicts that don't matter, that never mattered, that they can't return to.

Ibrahim limps to the window. Outside, McMurdo District spreads across the ice—geometric architecture, orderly streets, functioning systems. Even now, Year 9, the megacity maintains itself. Transport running. Power flowing. People going to work because what else would they do?

It's beautiful in its way. Clean. Organized. Dying with dignity.

Everything he fought for will end like this. The holy lands—contested ground, ancient prayers, blood-soaked earth—will be vapor. The wars will mean nothing. The causes will be forgotten in the moment of impact.

He fought for nothing.

Killed for nothing.

Lost his faith for nothing.

The thought should devastate him. Somehow, it doesn't. It just... settles. Truth landing like snow, quiet and undeniable.

"Mr. al-Rashid."

Ibrahim turns. A nurse—Olivia, young, competent, kind—stands with his discharge papers.

"Your release is approved," she says. "You're cleared for independent living. UN refugee housing has a unit ready. Fourth floor, shared facilities, functional. Not glamorous, but—"

"It's fine," Ibrahim says. "Thank you."

"You'll need weekly physical therapy. Maintenance work to prevent muscle atrophy. Pain management—we're giving you a month's supply, but after that you'll need to see the clinic. Questions?"

"Where do I go? After discharge?"

Olivia's professional smile softens into something more human. "That's up to you. You have time—six years. Figure out what matters. Use it well."

She hands him the papers and leaves. Ibrahim looks at them—bureaucratic language, medical terminology, practical instructions for living with permanent injury. Nothing about how to live without purpose. Nothing about what to do when everything you believed turns out to be lies you told yourself.

He gets dressed—slow process, left leg resisting—and walks out of the hospital.

The Antarctic air hits him: cold, clean, sharp. He breathes it deeply. His first time outside in two months. The sun circles the horizon, polar summer, endless light for endless days of not knowing what comes next.

He limps toward the refugee housing district. Twenty minutes on foot—would be ten without the limp, would be five before the wound. But time doesn't matter anymore. Where is he rushing to? There's no battle waiting. No prayer time to keep. No purpose requiring speed.

Just: movement. Step by painful step.

The housing complex is utilitarian—concrete blocks, narrow windows, efficient use of limited space. His unit is 4-B, fourth floor, no elevator. Ibrahim stares at the stairs.

"Need help?"

Ibrahim turns. A man stands there—maybe sixty, weathered face, maintenance uniform. The building super, probably.

"I can manage," Ibrahim says.

"Sure. But there's a ground-floor unit opening next week. Injured fighter last month—transferred to hospice. I could get you switched if you want. Save you the climb."

"Hospice?"

"Yeah. Combat injuries, complications. Happens." The man shrugs—not callous, just realistic. "We're all dying anyway. Some just faster."

Ibrahim nods slowly. "I'll take the fourth floor. The climb is... good for me."

"Your call. Name's Marcus. You need anything, let me know."

Marcus leaves. Ibrahim faces the stairs. Four flights. Left leg screaming already. He could wait for the ground-floor unit. Could make it easier.

But easy doesn't help. Easy doesn't rebuild.

He climbs.

It takes fifteen minutes. By the second floor, his leg is fire. By the third, he's sweating despite the cold. Fourth floor, he sits on the landing for five minutes, breathing hard, leg shaking.

But he made it.

Unit 4-B is a single room. Bed, desk, chair, small kitchenette. Bathroom shared with three other units. Window facing the ice shelf and solar arrays stretching endlessly. Functional. Adequate. Empty.

Ibrahim sits on the bed. Sets down his cane. Looks at his hands—scarred from combat, calloused from weapons, marked by five years of fighting for certainty he no longer has.

What now?

He doesn't know.

For the first time in his life, he doesn't know what comes next.

And strangely—impossibly—that's okay.

---

The first week, Ibrahim does nothing productive. He eats when hungry. Sleeps when tired. Sits at the window watching the solar arrays and the people moving below—tiny figures going to work, coming home, living mechanically through the end.

He's supposed to attend physical therapy. Doesn't go. The pain is constant anyway—what's more exercise going to change? His leg is damaged. His identity is shattered. Therapy won't fix either.

But on day eight, the pain gets worse. He can barely walk to the shared bathroom. Can barely make it back. The nurse's words echo: *maintenance work to prevent muscle atrophy.*

He's letting himself decay.

Like the world. Like everything.

Day nine, he forces himself downstairs. Fifteen minutes again, leg screaming. He finds the medical clinic, checks in for therapy. The therapist—stern older woman named Dr. Okafor—takes one look at him and says, "You haven't been moving."

"I moved here."

"I mean exercising. Keeping the leg active. You're letting it stiffen."

"Does it matter? Six years from now—"

"Six years from now, you'll be dead. But you're not dead yet. You want to spend those six years unable to walk? Or you want to use them?"

Ibrahim doesn't have an answer.

"Thought so," Dr. Okafor says. "Get on the mat. We're starting over."

She works him hard—stretches that hurt, exercises that burn, movements his leg doesn't want to make. He's sweating, gasping, hating every second.

But when he leaves, he can walk easier.

Not fixed. But: functional.

He goes back the next day. And the next. And the next.

After two weeks, he can climb the stairs without stopping. After three, the pain is still there but manageable. After four, Dr. Okafor says, "You're doing good. Keep this up."

"For what?" Ibrahim asks. "What am I keeping it up for?"

"That's your question to answer. I just make sure you can walk while you figure it out."

Ibrahim limps back to his unit. Climbs the four flights. Sits at the window.

What is he figuring out?

He doesn't know.

But he keeps going to therapy. Keeps climbing the stairs. Keeps moving.

Because stopping means dying.

And he's not ready to die yet.

Even without knowing why he's living.

---

Week six in Antarctica, Ibrahim starts walking the city. Not for therapy—just: walking. Exploring. Seeing what's left of human civilization in Year 9.

McMurdo District is vast but emptying. Buildings with dark windows. Shops that closed. Whole sectors evacuated. But still: people. Still: life in the cracks. Coffee shops operating with synthetic beans and recycled water. Libraries maintained by volunteers. Parks where children play despite the countdown.

He finds religious spaces—mosques, churches, temples, synagogues. All of them still functioning, though attendance is sparse. He sits in the back of a mosque during Friday prayer. The imam leads. Maybe twenty people pray. Ibrahim watches.

He can't pray anymore. The words are hollow. The rituals empty. God—if God exists—doesn't care about their prayers, didn't stop the asteroid, won't save them from impact.

But he watches the faithful pray. Sees their devotion. Understands it—he had it once, absolute certainty, total faith. Remembers how it felt to know what was right, to believe God was watching, to think his actions mattered cosmically.

He envies them.

But he can't go back.

After prayer, an old man approaches him. "You didn't pray, brother."

"No," Ibrahim says. "I can't."

"Why not?"

"I don't believe anymore."

The old man nods—sad but not surprised. "Many have lost faith. The asteroid shook everyone. But faith isn't about certainty. It's about trust. Trust that God has a plan, even when we can't see it."

"What plan includes seven billion people dying?"

"I don't know. But not knowing is part of faith."

Ibrahim stands—carefully, favoring his good leg. "Respectfully, brother—faith without knowing isn't faith. It's hope. And I'm out of hope."

He leaves. The old man doesn't follow.

Outside, Ibrahim breathes the cold air. His leg aches. His chest aches differently—emptiness where faith used to be, absence where certainty lived.

He walks to the library. Finds books on philosophy, religion, meaning. Reads because he doesn't know what else to do. Kierkegaard. Camus. Nietzsche. Buddhist sutras. Christian theology. Islamic philosophy. Humanist manifestos.

Everyone trying to answer the same question: what do we do with finitude? How do we live knowing we die?

No one has a good answer.

Or everyone does, and they're all equally valid and equally useless.

Ibrahim reads for hours. Returns the next day. And the next.

A librarian—elderly woman, maybe seventy—notices him. "You're here a lot."

"Nothing else to do."

"You looking for something specific?"

"Meaning, maybe. Purpose. Reason to keep walking around instead of giving up."

She smiles gently. "You'll find hundreds of books claiming to have that answer. But I'll save you some time: there isn't one answer. There's just the question. And how you respond to it."

"How do you respond?"

"I keep the library open. Catalog books. Help people find what they're looking for. Is it meaningful? I don't know. But it's what I do."

Ibrahim nods slowly. "Thank you."

"For what?"

"For not pretending you have answers."

She laughs. "At seventy, pretending seems like wasted effort. I just do what I can with what's left."

---

Month three in Antarctica, Ibrahim runs into Kenji Torres.

Literally—turns a corner, not watching where he's going, collides with someone. They both stumble. Ibrahim catches himself on his cane. The other man catches him by the arm.

"Sorry, I wasn't—" Kenji stops. Stares. "Ibrahim?"

Ibrahim stares back. The seeker from Jerusalem, Year 3. The questioner who asked if God wanted violence. Elena's son.

"Kenji," Ibrahim says.

They stand in the cold street, two wounded men, recognizing each other's transformation.

"You're here," Kenji says. "In Antarctica."

"Wounded. Evacuated. Can't go back."

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. The wound saved my life. Stopped me fighting for nothing." Ibrahim gestures at Kenji. "You're here too. Thought you were in Lagos."

"I was. Studying with a teacher—Professor Wei. She died Year 12. I came back to be with my mother." Kenji pauses. "You want to walk? I find it easier to talk while moving."

They walk—both limping, Ibrahim physically, Kenji metaphorically. Through the orderly streets, past the functioning systems, two seekers without destinations.

"My mother mentioned you," Kenji says. "Said she met you in the hospital. Said you'd lost faith."

"Completely."

"How does it feel?"

"Like drowning and flying at the same time. Terrifying. Liberating. Empty. Full." Ibrahim laughs bitterly. "I don't know. All of it."

"I never had faith to lose," Kenji says. "But I spent years seeking something to replace it. Tried everything. Eventually learned the seeking was the problem. That presence matters more than certainty."

"Professor Wei taught you that?"

"Her and... experience. Time. Failure." Kenji stops walking, meets Ibrahim's eyes. "You asked me in Jerusalem if I'd found meaning. I said I was still looking. Now I'm not looking. I'm just being here. Present. With my mother. With the time left."

"Is that enough?"

"I don't know. But it's honest."

They walk for another hour. Kenji tells him about Wei's teachings—impermanence, non-clinging, the gardenia that bloomed and died. About learning to stop running from truth. About returning home not because he had answers but because running from questions was cowardice.

Ibrahim listens. Doesn't agree with everything. Doesn't disagree either. Just: listens.

When they part, Kenji says, "I'm around if you want to talk. No pressure. But... I get it. The not knowing. It's hard. But it's also the only honest place to start."

Ibrahim nods. "Thank you."

He walks back to his unit. Climbs the four flights—easier now, leg cooperating better. Sits at the window watching the sun circle endlessly.

Not knowing is honest.

He hasn't been honest in years.

Maybe that's where he starts.

Not with faith. Not with certainty. Not with purpose handed down by God or imam or ideology.

Just: honesty.

I don't know what matters.

I don't know what comes next.

I don't know how to live.

But I'm here. I'm breathing. I'm walking.

Maybe that's enough for now.

Maybe that's the beginning.

Ibrahim pulls out a notebook—something he bought at the market, never used. Opens it. Writes the first words he's written since before the wound:

*Year 9. I don't believe in God anymore. I don't know what I believe. But I'm alive. And I have six years to figure out what that means. This is the start.*

He stares at the words. They're not profound. Not beautiful. Not certain.

But they're honest.

And honesty—for the first time in his life—feels like enough.

Outside, the sun circles. Inside, Ibrahim writes. And somewhere in the wounded space where faith used to live, something else begins growing.

Not certainty. Not belief.

Just: willingness.

Willingness to not know.

Willingness to keep walking.

Willingness to be present for the six years remaining.

It's not much.

But it's his.

And maybe—maybe—that's everything.
