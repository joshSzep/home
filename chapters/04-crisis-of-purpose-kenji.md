# Chapter 4: Crisis of Purpose

**POV: Kenji Torres | Year 1, Day 1 | Antarctic Megacity, McMurdo District**

---

The notification woke Kenji at 4:47 AM.

Not his alarm—that wouldn't sound until 7:00. This was his mother's priority signal, the emergency override that bypassed all sleep settings. He'd only heard it three times before: infrastructure failures, civil emergencies, situations where the mayor needed her son immediately.

He sat up in the dark apartment, heart already racing before his brain fully engaged. The message was text only: *"Come now. Official residence. Don't comm. Just come. -Mom"*

No explanation. No context. Just urgency compressed into thirteen words.

Kenji dressed quickly—discarding his usual deliberation over clothes. Whatever this was, it didn't matter what he wore. Five minutes later he was in the transit system, mostly empty at this hour. A handful of night shift workers heading home. A couple maintenance techs. No one looking at him, no one aware that the mayor's son was racing through the pre-dawn darkness toward crisis.

His mind cycled through possibilities. Economic collapse? Another district threatening war? Environmental catastrophe? His mother didn't panic. Twenty years in politics had given her ice in her veins. For her to use the emergency signal meant something unprecedented.

The government district was quiet. Security recognized him at the entrance to his mother's building—they always did, though he visited less frequently than he should. Too busy with the dissertation. Too absorbed in academic work. Too comfortable keeping family at arm's length while he built his career.

Elevator to the forty-seventh floor. The hallway was empty except for two security officers flanking his mother's door. They nodded, stepped aside. One said quietly: "She's expecting you."

The door opened before he could knock.

Elena Torres stood in her robe, hair loose, face carrying an expression Kenji had never seen before. Not quite devastation. Not quite shock. Something between those states—a kind of hollowed-out comprehension.

"Mom?"

"Come in, mijo. Sit."

Her apartment was dark except for one lamp. His mother guided him to the couch with a hand on his shoulder. She sat beside him, close, and took both his hands in hers. The gesture alone was alarming—his mother wasn't physically demonstrative, had learned to maintain professional distance even at home.

"There's no easy way to say this." Her voice was steady but wrong somehow. Too controlled. "An hour ago, Dr. Okafor at the monitoring station detected an asteroid. Large. Fast. Direct trajectory toward Earth."

Kenji's brain started processing immediately—four years studying asteroid deflection made the analysis automatic. "How large? How much time do we have for deflection?"

"Fifteen kilometers diameter. Fifteen years to impact." She squeezed his hands. "And no, mijo. We can't deflect it. Dr. Okafor ran every scenario. The emergency coordinator consulted with the International Space Agency. I've spent the last forty-five minutes on calls with every space program director on Earth." She paused. "The object is too massive, moving too fast, and we have insufficient time. Every deflection option fails."

The words landed but didn't fully connect. Like information in a language he was learning but hadn't mastered. Asteroid. Fifteen years. Can't deflect. The phrases made sense individually but their combination seemed impossible.

"That's..." He stopped. What was it? Impossible? His mother wouldn't summon him at 4:47 AM for a mistake. Wrong? She'd just told him every expert on Earth had confirmed it. "That's everyone."

"Yes."

"Four billion people here in Antarctica. Eight billion total."

"Yes."

"In fifteen years."

"Yes." His mother's eyes were wet now, reflecting the single lamp. "I'm sorry, Kenji. I'm so sorry. I wanted—" Her voice cracked. "I wanted grandchildren. I wanted to see you settled and happy. I wanted to be old. I wanted you to be old." She pulled him close, held him like she hadn't since he was a child. "Your father died at sixty-two and I thought it was too young. You'll be thirty-nine. That's not fair. That's not right."

Kenji sat in his mother's embrace, his mind still processing. The dissertation. "Theoretical Deflection Scenarios for Near-Earth Objects." Four years of research. Two hundred seventy-three pages. Defense scheduled for next month. Every scenario modeled with the assumption that early detection plus appropriate technology equals survival.

But there were limits. Mass limits. Velocity limits. Time limits. He'd written entire chapters on scenarios where deflection became impossible. Academic exercises. Hypothetical edge cases. Never expecting...

"I need to see the data," he said.

"Dr. Okafor is sending it to all relevant personnel. You should have access."

Kenji pulled up his personal screen. The file was there, marked with the highest security classification. He opened it.

**Object: 3025-AZ1**  
**Mass: ~1.5 × 10^15 kg**  
**Estimated diameter: 10-15 km**  
**Velocity: 28.3 km/s**  
**Distance: 2.4 AU**  
**Impact probability: 99.97%**  
**Time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days**

Below that: the deflection analysis. Kinetic impactor—insufficient by factor of 240. Nuclear deflection—inadequate yield, high fragmentation risk. Gravity tractor—requires 50+ years. Mass driver—installation time exceeds available window.

Every option: INSUFFICIENT.

His dissertation had a section on exactly this scenario: "Terminal Cases: When Deflection Becomes Physically Impossible." He'd written it academically, dispassionately. Mass too large. Velocity too high. Time too short. The mathematics was elegant—clear boundaries where physics became absolute and human capability irrelevant.

He'd never imagined reading those same conclusions about a real object.

"You understand?" his mother asked.

"Yes." The word came out flat. Clinical. Four years of technical training overriding emotion. "The numbers are correct. Given the parameters, deflection is impossible with current technology."

"I don't need the analysis, mijo. I need to know if my son understands that he's going to die."

The bluntness cracked something in his chest. "I understand."

They sat in silence. Through the windows, McMurdo District sprawled—one district among dozens spanning the Antarctic continent, lights merging into an endless urban horizon. Four billion lives across the megacity, all temporary now. All counting down. His mother had governed Antarctica for eight years. Maintained order, planned futures, built infrastructure designed to last centuries. All of it ending in fifteen years.

"What do you need from me?" Elena asked. "As your mother. Not as mayor. What do you need?"

Kenji didn't know. The question was too large. What do you need when your future disappears? When all the plans crumble? When every assumption about life span and career and meaning evaporates?

"I don't know," he said.

"That's okay. You don't have to know." She stood, moved to the kitchen, started making tea. The automatic ritual of crisis. "I don't know what I need either. I just know I need to do something. Maintain routines. Keep moving. Because if I stop..." She trailed off.

Kenji watched her work through familiar motions. His mother, the most powerful human on Earth, reduced to making tea because that was something concrete, something controllable, something that made sense when nothing else did.

"I have eight more calls," she said, pouring the water. "Emergency coordinators, district governors, security council members. They're all asking the same question: what do we do? And I don't have an answer. How do you govern four billion people—" Her voice caught. "How do you govern when there's no future to govern for?"

"You still govern," Kenji said quietly. He wasn't sure where the words came from. Shock, maybe. Or the clinical detachment that let him analyze problems without feeling them. "The future ended, but today's still happening. People still need... infrastructure. Order. Someone to—" He stopped. The words sounded hollow even as he said them.

"Someone to lie to them that it'll be okay?" Elena brought the tea over. Set a cup in front of him. "Because that's what governance feels like right now. Organized lying."

"Or organized presence," Kenji suggested. "You can't save anyone. But you can show up. Maintain order while order still matters. That's not lying. That's... something."

His mother looked at him, really looked at him. "When did you get wise?"

"I'm not wise. I'm in shock. Ask me again tomorrow and I'll probably be useless."

She smiled slightly. Sad but real. "Tomorrow. That's still a thing, isn't it? Tomorrow. Next week. Fifteen years of tomorrows." She took a sip of tea. "I keep thinking: I won't see you grow old. Won't meet your children. Won't—" She stopped. Collected herself. "But you're here now. That's something."

"That's something," Kenji agreed.

So he stayed. They sat together on the couch, drinking tea, not talking much. His mother leaned against him eventually—seeking comfort, offering it. They watched the city lights through the window. Four billion people across the continent who would learn in the morning that everything had changed.

"The briefings don't matter anymore," she said, back to him. "Everything I've built. Every policy. Every long-term plan. It all ends in fifteen years."

"You could resign. Spend the time differently."

"I could." She poured the tea, handed him a cup. "But I won't. Someone has to maintain order. Someone has to say: we tried, we cared, we didn't give up." She sipped her tea. "Even if it doesn't matter, I'll do it anyway. Because what else is there?"

Kenji understood. His dissertation had been who he was. Four years of work, identity built around research and academic future. Now: meaningless. Defense scheduled for next month. He'd never be Dr. Torres. Never have the career he'd imagined. Never contribute to humanity's long-term survival because there was no long-term anymore.

"I should go," he said.

"Stay a while longer." His mother's voice was gentle. "Please. I don't want to be alone right now."

So he stayed. They sat together on the couch, drinking tea, not talking much. His mother leaned against him eventually—seeking comfort, offering it. They watched the city lights through the window. Four million people who would learn in the morning that everything had changed.

"Do you think people will panic?" Kenji asked.

"Some will. Some will deny. Some will continue as if nothing's different. Everyone will cope in their own way." Elena was quiet for a moment. "I'll need to address the district. Establish protocols. Maintain stability. The work doesn't end just because the world is ending."

"Does that help? Doing the work?"

"I don't know yet. Ask me in fifteen years."

It should have been a joke. Neither of them laughed.

Eventually, Kenji left. The transit system was starting to fill with early shift workers—still unaware, still living in the world before detection. He watched their faces: tired, routine, ordinary. By evening they'd look different. By evening everyone would carry the weight he was carrying now.

He returned to his apartment in the research housing complex. His dissertation was still open on his terminal: Chapter 3, "Long-Term Deflection Strategies."

Long-term. Fifty-year missions. Century-spanning infrastructure. Assuming humanity had time.

Humanity had fifteen years.

Kenji closed the file. Stared at the blank screen. Four years of work. Two hundred and seventy-three pages. Defense scheduled for next month. All of it rendered irrelevant by a single detection.

He thought about deleting it. Erasing everything. But his hand didn't move toward the delete command. Instead, he just: closed the program. Walked away. Left the dissertation unopened.

He'd never open it again. Never finish it. Never defend it. Never become Dr. Torres, asteroid deflection specialist. That future was gone.

What future remained?

The question sat in his chest, heavy and unanswerable. Twenty-four years old. PhD almost complete. Bright future ahead. Career planned. Life trajectory established.

All of it: gone. Fifteen years left. He'd be thirty-nine when the asteroid hit. Never forty. Never middle-aged. Never old. Thirty-nine years of life, then: nothing.

His father had died at sixty-two. Kenji used to think that was young. Now it seemed like a luxury. His father had sixty-two years. Kenji would get thirty-nine. Maya—a cousin's daughter he'd met twice—would get seventeen.

The unfairness was incomprehensible.

By 7:00 AM, his screen showed emergency broadcasts. News spreading through every channel. His personal messages were accumulating: colleagues, classmates, his dissertation advisor Dr. Okafor. Everyone reaching out, everyone needing connection.

He didn't answer. Didn't know what to say.

Outside his window, the Antarctic dawn was approaching—pale twilight that passed for sunrise this time of year. Kenji stood at the glass and watched the sky lighten. Somewhere up there, an asteroid was falling. Had been falling for millions of years. Would continue falling for fifteen more.

Then: impact.

Then: extinction.

Then: nothing.

He thought about his dissertation. Four years studying how to prevent exactly this scenario. All the theory. All the models. All the careful work. And the answer was: we can't. Object too large, timeline too short, technology insufficient.

His life's work was failure before it could even be tested.

What now?

The question echoed. What now? What do you do when your future disappears? When your purpose becomes irrelevant? When all the plans crumble and there's no time to build new ones that matter?

He didn't know.

Didn't know who he was without the dissertation. Without the career ahead. Without the assumption of future.

Twenty-four years old. Fifteen years left. And absolutely no idea what to do with them.

His mother had purpose still—governance, maintaining order, bearing witness. Dr. Okafor had purpose—tracking the object, providing data, serving her function. Everyone would find their role, their way of spending fifteen years.

Kenji had nothing. The dissertation was dead. The academic career was dead. The future was dead. What remained?

The question sat unanswered. Would sit unanswered for a long time. Would drive him to parties, substances, travel, seeking. Would push him through seven years of desperate searching for meaning that might not exist.

But that was later. Right now, in the pale Antarctic dawn of Day 1, Kenji Torres sat in his small apartment and felt the weight of fifteen years pressing down like gravity he couldn't escape.

Twenty-four years old.

PhD candidate.

Former future.

No answers.

Just: the question.

What now?

What now?

What now?
