# Chapter 2 - Elena

The call came at 4:23 AM.

Elena Torres had been awake for an hour already, reviewing budget allocations for the McMurdo District water reclamation system—the kind of tedious, essential work that actually kept a city of four billion people alive. The emergency line lit up on her desk comm, the priority tone that meant crisis.

She accepted the call. Dr. Amara Okafor's face appeared, and Elena knew immediately that something was very wrong. Amara's composure was legendary—Elena had seen her brief the council on everything from solar flare impacts to facility accidents without a flicker of emotion. But now there was something in her eyes, some tightness around her mouth.

"Dr. Okafor," Elena said. "Please tell me this is a false positive."

The pause before Amara answered told Elena everything.

"It's not."

Elena looked at the data Amara transmitted. Impact probability: 99.97%. Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. Classification: Extinction-level event.

She'd been mayor of Antarctica for twelve years. She'd managed cyclone season crises, infrastructure collapses, diplomatic incidents with other regional governments, even the Great Power Failure of 3023 that had left half the city dark for three days. She'd learned to stay calm in crisis, to project certainty even when uncertain, to make decisions with incomplete information.

But she'd never had to manage the end of the world.

"Can we deflect it?" Elena asked, already knowing the answer from Amara's expression.

"No."

"You're certain?"

"I've run every scenario." Amara's voice was flat, clinical. "The mass, velocity, and time frame make deflection impossible with current technology. Even if we launched every spacecraft on Earth, even if we detonated our entire nuclear arsenal in a coordinated strike—it's not enough. We'd need at least thirty years and technology we don't have. We have fifteen."

Elena set down her stylus with careful precision. Her hands wanted to shake. She didn't let them.

"When will this become public knowledge?"

"The monitoring network has already flagged it as extinction-level. The AI systems are following protocol—verification from multiple stations, then global alert. I'd estimate within the next hour."

One hour. To prepare for the collapse of civilization. To figure out what she could possibly say to four billion people in Antarctica alone, eight billion worldwide. To find some way to maintain order when order had just become meaningless.

"I need to convene the emergency council," Elena said, her mind already moving through protocols, procedures, chains of command. "I need to prepare a statement. I need to—"

She stopped. For just a moment, the professional distance she'd cultivated for decades slipped, and she felt the raw enormity of it. Everyone she knew was going to die. Everyone she was responsible for. Her son. Kenji would die at thirty-nine years old. Barely older than she'd been when she'd had him.

Hiroshi had died five years ago. At the time, she'd felt the unfairness of it—he was only sixty-two, they should have had more time. Now she thought: *You were lucky. You died not knowing.*

Elena pulled herself together. "Thank you, Dr. Okafor. I know this isn't..." She trailed off. What could she say? *Thank you for detecting our extinction?* "Thank you for calling me directly."

"Mayor Torres—Elena—"

"Yes?"

"Your son is in my lab. Kenji. He was working late on his dissertation analysis. He'll have seen the alert by now."

Kenji. Her brilliant, restless son who'd been studying astrophysics under Amara's mentorship. Who'd been asking questions about meaning and purpose for months now, unsettled in ways she didn't fully understand. Who was about to learn that his future had just been reduced to fifteen years.

"Is he—" Elena's voice cracked slightly.

"I'll tell him to call you."

"Thank you."

The call ended.

Elena sat in her study, surrounded by the trappings of power—the mayor's seal on the wall, the certificates and awards, the photos with world leaders and dignitaries. All of it meaningless now. She was the most powerful person in Antarctica, arguably the most powerful person on Earth given Antarctica's population and resources. And she couldn't do a damned thing about an asteroid.

Her comm lit up again. Emergency council requesting secure conference. She accepted, and suddenly her screen was filled with faces—district leaders, security chiefs, the heads of food production, energy, water, medical services. All the people who kept Antarctica functioning.

All of them looking at her for answers.

"I assume you've all seen the alert," Elena said.

Chen Wei, head of East Antarctica District, spoke first. "Is this confirmed? Extinction-level?"

"Yes. I've spoken with Dr. Okafor directly. The asteroid is real, the trajectory is certain, and deflection is not possible with current technology."

Silence. Elena watched them process it. Some had been woken by the alert, were still in sleeping clothes. Others, like her, had been working through the night. All of them looked stunned.

"How long?" asked Sarah Kimathi, West District.

"Fifteen years."

"What are our options?" This from Marcus DaSilva, Security.

Elena wanted to laugh. It came out as a sharp exhale. "We have no options. That's the point. An asteroid the size of a mountain is going to hit Earth in fifteen years and we can't stop it."

"There must be something—" DaSilva started.

"There isn't." Elena kept her voice level, authoritative. They needed her to be certain, even about this. "I will coordinate with the UN to verify independently, but Dr. Okafor is the leading expert in orbital mechanics. If she says we can't deflect it, we can't deflect it."

"Then what do we do?" Kimathi asked quietly.

That was the question, wasn't it? What did you do when you couldn't do anything?

"We maintain order," Elena said. "We keep the city functioning. We keep people fed, housed, safe. We have fifteen years to figure out how to face this with some measure of dignity."

Even as she said it, she knew how hollow it sounded. Maintain order? The global alert would go out any minute. Eight billion people learning they were going to die. How did you maintain order through that?

"The birth centers," Chen said suddenly. "The genetic design programs. We have thousands of pregnancies in progress, applications pending—"

"I know." Elena felt something twist in her chest. All those parents planning for their children's futures. Selecting genes for longevity, health, intelligence. Hoping to give their children the best chance at life in humanity's permanent home on Earth.

What was the point of designing a child to live to 150 when the world ended in fifteen years?

"We need to address the public immediately," Kimathi said. "Before panic spreads. People will be waking up to the alert. If we don't provide clear information, clear leadership—"

"I'll prepare a statement," Elena said. "City-wide broadcast at dawn. Six AM."

"That's less than two hours—"

"Then I'd better start writing."

The meeting continued—logistics, contingencies, emergency protocols. Elena participated, made decisions, projected calm authority. Inside, she felt like she was standing at the edge of an abyss.

When the meeting finally ended, she had forty-five minutes to write a speech that would broadcast to four billion people in Antarctica and be rebroadcast globally. What did you say? *Good morning, everyone's going to die, please remain calm?*

Her comm chimed. Private line. Kenji.

She accepted immediately. Her son's face appeared—young, frightened in a way she hadn't seen since he was a child waking from nightmares.

"Mom."

"Kenji." Just seeing him threatened her composure. "Where are you?"

"Still at the lab. I saw the data. I thought—I thought there had to be a mistake, but Dr. Okafor says—" His voice broke.

"Come home," Elena said. "Right now. Come home."

"I'm on my way."

He arrived twenty minutes later, letting himself into the mayoral residence with his old access code. Elena met him in the hallway and pulled him into an embrace. He was taller than her now, had been for years, but in that moment he felt small and young and terrifyingly mortal.

"I don't know what to do," she whispered into his shoulder.

Kenji pulled back to look at her. "You don't have to know. You just have to—"

"Be the mayor? Project certainty? Give people hope?" Elena laughed bitterly. "There is no hope, Kenji. In fifteen years we're all going to be dead. You're going to be dead at thirty-nine. I'm going to be—" She stopped. Seventy-eight. She'd be seventy-eight. If she made it that long. If civilization lasted that long.

"Then what?" Kenji asked. "We just give up?"

"I don't know." Elena stepped back, straightening her jacket. Professional distance reasserting itself. "I have to address the city in fifteen minutes. I need to—I need to figure out what to say."

"Tell them the truth."

"The truth is we're all going to die."

"Then tell them that." Kenji's voice was strained but steady. "You can't fix this, Mom. Nobody can. So just... be honest. Tell them what's happening. Don't pretend you have answers you don't have."

Elena looked at her son—her brilliant, searching son who'd never quite fit into the future she'd imagined for him. Who'd been asking questions about meaning for months, as if he'd sensed something was coming.

"I don't know how to lead through this," she admitted.

"You'll figure it out. You always do."

She wanted to believe him.

---

At exactly 6:00 AM, Elena Torres stood in the broadcasting studio of the mayoral complex and looked into the camera that would transmit her face to four billion people across Antarctica and billions more worldwide.

She'd written and rewritten the speech three times. Each version had felt more hollow than the last. Finally, she'd thrown out the script entirely.

The light turned green. She was live.

"Good morning," she said. Her voice was steady. "By now, most of you have seen the alert from the Global Asteroid Monitoring Network. I'm here to confirm that the information is accurate. An asteroid measuring approximately fifteen kilometers in diameter has been detected on a collision course with Earth. Impact will occur in fifteen years, two months, and fourteen days. Deflection is not possible with current technology."

She paused. Across Antarctica, she knew, billions of people were watching. Some had been awake for hours, glued to their screens. Others were just waking, learning of this for the first time. Some were with family. Some were alone. All of them were looking to her for something—reassurance, guidance, hope.

She had none of those things to give.

"I know what you're feeling right now," Elena continued. "Fear. Disbelief. Anger. I'm feeling it too. I wish I could tell you we have a plan to stop this. I wish I could tell you everything will be all right. But I won't lie to you. We can't stop the asteroid. In fifteen years, human civilization will end."

She saw the camera operator's face go pale. This wasn't the speech anyone expected. Mayors didn't tell people they were going to die without offering some kind of plan, some kind of hope.

But there was no plan. There was no hope. There was only truth.

"What we can do," Elena said, "is choose how we spend the time we have. We can maintain our civilization. We can support each other. We can live with purpose and dignity. We have fifteen years. That's longer than some people get. It's not enough, but it's what we have."

She thought of Hiroshi, dead five years now. He'd had sixty-two years. Some people lived to 150 with current medicine. Some died young in accidents or illness. Death had always been certain. Now it was just... scheduled.

"The city will continue to function," she said. "Food production, water, energy, medical services—all systems will be maintained. I will work with district leaders and the global community to ensure that our remaining time is as stable and peaceful as possible. I know that many of you will have questions, will need support. We will provide resources for counseling, community gathering, whatever you need."

What did anyone need when the world was ending?

"I don't have all the answers," Elena admitted. "I don't know what the next fifteen years will look like. I don't know how to process this any better than you do. But I know this: we're still here. Today, right now, we're alive. And as long as we're alive, we matter. What we do matters. How we treat each other matters."

She took a breath.

"I'll be providing regular updates as we learn more. For now, please check on your neighbors, your family, your friends. Be kind to each other. Be kind to yourselves. We're going to need each other in the days ahead."

Elena paused, searching for how to end this. Every speech she'd ever given had ended with hope, with a call to action, with confidence in the future.

There was no future.

"That's all I have," she said finally. "I'm sorry I can't offer more."

The light turned red. The broadcast ended.

Elena stood in the studio, suddenly exhausted. The camera operator was crying silently. The broadcast technician had her head in her hands.

Elena's comm was already lighting up—dozens of calls, hundreds of messages, district leaders demanding meetings, citizens begging for more information. The city was waking up fully now, and reality was settling in.

She thought about Kenji waiting for her at home. About Amara alone at her monitoring station. About the four billion people in Antarctica looking to her for leadership when there was nothing to lead toward except the end.

Outside the studio windows, dawn was breaking over McMurdo District. The sun rose over the megacity's towers and terraces, over the solar arrays and hydroponic farms, over the intricate systems that kept four billion people alive on a continent that had been uninhabitable a thousand years ago.

In fifteen years, all of it would be gone.

Elena Torres, Mayor of Antarctica, the most powerful person on Earth, stood watching the sunrise and felt utterly, completely powerless.

Her comm chimed again. Emergency council. Crisis in the birth centers—parents demanding terminations, demanding answers, demanding she fix this.

She couldn't fix this.

But she answered the call anyway, because it was her job, because someone had to try to hold things together, because even if it was meaningless in the end, it was all she knew how to do.

"Mayor Torres," she said. "What's the situation?"

And the longest day of her life began.
