# Chapter 25: Amara

The monitoring facility is a tomb.

Amara Okafor sits at her workstation, staring at screens that show the same data they've shown for ten years: trajectory confirmed, impact inevitable, countdown precise. Year 10. Five years remaining. 1,826 days until extinction.

She's been tracking this asteroid for a decade. Calculated every variable. Explored every impossible solution. Wasted every moment.

The facility used to house sixty scientists. Now: three. Chen works the night shift. Rodriguez quit last month. Just Amara, alone in the vast empty space, updating calculations that don't need updating, refining predictions that don't need refining.

She's been hiding here for ten years.

Today, she stops.

Amara closes the monitoring programs. Shuts down her workstation. Walks out of the facility for the last time.

The Antarctic morning is bright—polar summer, sun circling endlessly. The cold air hits her face like truth. Sharp. Undeniable. Real.

She pulls out her comm unit. Finds David's contact. Stares at it for five minutes.

They've been married twelve years. Strangers for ten of them. She knows his schedule—he's at the solar arrays, maintaining systems with robots who are better colleagues than humans. She knows he comes home late, avoids the apartment, avoids her. She knows he's been dying too, just differently.

She knows because she's been doing the same thing.

Different hiding places. Same death.

Amara calls him.

"Chen here," David's voice, flat and automatic.

"David. It's Amara."

Pause. "Is something wrong?"

"Yes. Everything. But I want to fix it."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm coming to the arrays. I need to talk to you. Please."

Another pause. "I'm at platform seventy-three."

"I'll find it."

She disconnects before she loses courage.

The transit to the solar arrays takes twenty minutes. Amara hasn't been here in years—David's domain, his escape, the place he goes to avoid feeling. She takes the lift to platform seventy-three, two hundred meters up, wind whipping cold around her.

David stands there, tools in hand, looking shocked to see her.

"Amara."

She crosses the platform, heart pounding. "We wasted ten years."

The words land like she knew they would. Undeniable.

"I know," David says quietly.

"I wasted them tracking an asteroid I can't stop. You wasted them maintaining arrays for no one. We both just... hid. From each other. From everything."

"Yes."

"And I don't want to waste five more." Her voice cracks but she pushes through. "I don't want to die estranged. I don't want our marriage to end like this—two ghosts in the same apartment, polite and distant and already dead."

David stares at her. She can see him processing, calculating, trying to understand what she's asking.

"I'm saying I'm sorry," Amara continues. "I'm saying I was wrong to hide in work. I'm saying you deserve better than a ghost for a wife. I'm saying I love you. Still. Maybe always. And I want to try. For five years. I want to actually be married instead of just cohabiting."

She's crying now. She hates it—the loss of control, the emotion spilling over. But she doesn't stop.

David steps closer. Takes her hand.

"Okay," he says. "Let's try."

The relief hits her like a wave. "Just like that?"

"Not just like that. It's... I've been thinking about it too. About us. About how we're wasting what's left." He squeezes her hand. "Maybe you need me. Maybe I need you."

"I do need you," Amara says. "I need us."

They stand on the platform, two hundred meters up, holding hands like they haven't held hands in a decade, and Amara thinks: *This is what matters. This. Not calculations. Not predictions. This.*

Learning to be present is harder than solving physics problems.

Amara has spent her life in her mind—calculating, analyzing, problem-solving. When detection happened, she doubled down: if she could just think hard enough, work long enough, calculate precisely enough, she could find a solution.

Ten years proved her wrong.

There is no solution. There never was.

So now: presence. Being here. With David. In the moment.

It's terrifying.

They start with coffee in the mornings. Simple. Small. Amara makes it—real coffee, synthesized but decent—and they sit at the kitchen table.

"How was your day?" she asks, and the question feels alien because when did they last ask each other normal questions?

David tells her about platform maintenance. Voltage deviations. Robot colleagues. His voice is flat at first, mechanical, but slowly—over days, over weeks—it warms. Becomes human again.

Amara tells him about leaving the monitoring facility. About the decision to stop hiding. About how strange it feels to not have work consuming her.

"What will you do instead?" David asks.

"I don't know. Be here. With you. Maybe that's enough."

"It is enough," David says.

They drink coffee. Talk. Sometimes fall into silence, but it's not uncomfortable anymore. It's just: being together.

Amara realizes she forgot what this felt like. Connection. Partnership. Marriage.

She forgot on purpose. Because connection meant loss. Because if she let herself love David, she'd have to face that she's losing him in five years.

But she's losing him anyway. Losing everyone. Losing herself.

Might as well be present for it.

---

Week two, Amara joins David at the arrays.

She's not trained for maintenance work, but she's brilliant—physics background, engineering knowledge, quick learner. David teaches her patiently. How to check connections. Recalibrate sensors. Update logs.

They work side by side. His robot colleague 47B adjusts to her presence—*Query: additional human detected. Maintenance efficiency parameters adjusting.*

"This is 47B," David says. "My colleague."

"You've mentioned it."

"It's a good listener."

"That's depressing."

"I know."

Amara studies the robot. It's efficient. Precise. Perfect. And David's been preferring it to humans—to her—for years.

"I'm sorry," she says suddenly.

"For what?"

"For making you so lonely you found robots better company than me."

David stops working. Looks at her directly. "I'm sorry too. For giving up. For hiding. For letting us die like this."

"We're not dead yet."

"No. Not yet."

They work through the morning. At lunch, they sit on the platform, eating protein bars, watching the ice shelf stretch endlessly.

"I talked to Zara yesterday," Amara says.

"How is she?"

"Happy. That's the impossible thing—she's happy. Her children are nine and six. She knows what's coming. But she's happy anyway." Amara shakes her head. "I don't understand it. How does she hold joy and grief at the same time?"

"Maybe because she's present. Not calculating the future. Just being with them now."

"Is that what we're doing? Being present?"

"Trying to," David says.

Amara leans against him—tentatively, testing if touch is allowed after ten years of distance. David puts his arm around her.

They sit there for twenty minutes. Not talking. Just: together.

It's the most peaceful Amara's felt in a decade.

---

Month two of trying, Kenji Torres shows up at their apartment.

Amara answers the door and stares. Her former student. Elena's son. The brilliant physics mind who dropped out after detection, ran away seeking meaning.

"Kenji?"

"Amara. Hi." He looks different—quieter, more present, less frantically seeking. "I came to see you. And my mother. I'm back in Antarctica."

"Come in. Coffee?"

They sit in the small kitchen—teacher and student reunited after nine years. David joins them, curious.

Kenji tells them about his journey. Tokyo's pleasure districts. Buddhist temples. Hindu ashrams. Jerusalem's conflicts. Meeting Ibrahim, the fighter losing faith. Lagos with Professor Wei—the old philosophy professor who taught him impermanence through dying gardenias.

"She died Year 12," Kenji says. "Natural death, age 119. She was ready. I wasn't. But she taught me... being present matters more than finding answers. Presence is the answer."

Amara listens, and something shifts in her chest. Kenji left because she couldn't give him answers about meaning. He sought everywhere. Found a teacher who admitted she had no answers—just presence.

And now he's back. Quiet. Clear. At peace.

"I'm proud of you," Amara says.

"For what?"

"For seeking. For finding. For coming home." She reaches across, squeezes his hand. "I spent ten years trying to solve the unsolvable. You spent nine years seeking the unseekable. We both failed. But you learned to stop. I'm just learning now."

"You're learning with David," Kenji observes. "I can see it. You're different. Both of you."

"We're trying," David says.

"That's everything," Kenji says. "Trying is everything."

When he leaves, Amara sits with David on their couch—sitting close, touching casually, something they couldn't do months ago.

"He found what I couldn't give him," she says. "Acceptance. Presence. Peace with not knowing."

"You're giving it to yourself now," David says.

"Am I?"

"You're here. With me. Not calculating. Not solving. Just: being."

Amara leans her head on his shoulder. "It's harder than physics."

"Everything meaningful is."

---

Month three, Zara calls.

Amara's sister appears on the video screen—beautiful, tired, alive. Behind her, children play. Maya, nine years old. Kofi, six. Both laughing, both temporary, both impossibly precious.

"Amara!" Zara's face lights up. "I miss you."

"I miss you too." Amara's throat tightens. "Your children are getting so big."

"I know. Maya's already asking questions I can't answer. Kofi still thinks we have forever." Zara smiles, sad and warm. "I'm coming to Antarctica. Year 15. Few months before... before. I want you to meet them properly. I want us to be together at the end."

"I'd like that. I'd like that so much."

"How are you? How's David?"

"We're... we're trying. We wasted ten years, Zara. I wasted ten years hiding from everything. But we're trying now."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. "I'm so glad. I told you—you were hiding. I'm glad you stopped."

"You were right. You chose life. I chose escape. But I'm choosing differently now."

"That's all we can do. Choose differently. Choose better." Zara glances at her children. "Maya! Kofi! Come say hi to Aunt Amara!"

The children tumble into view. Maya, serious and thoughtful. Kofi, energetic and curious. They wave at the screen.

"Hi Aunt Amara!" Maya says. "Mama says we're visiting you in Antarctica!"

"I can't wait to meet you properly," Amara says.

"Are you a scientist?" Maya asks.

"Yes. I study space."

"Like asteroids?"

Zara winces. Amara meets her sister's eyes, then looks at Maya. "Yes. Like asteroids."

"Cool! I want to be a scientist too!"

Amara's chest tightens. Maya wants to be a scientist. Maya won't live long enough to be a scientist. Maya has eight years left.

But Zara doesn't correct her. Doesn't remind her. Just smiles and says, "You'll be a great scientist."

After the call ends, Amara sits staring at the blank screen.

"You okay?" David asks.

"She's nine. She wants to be a scientist. She'll never—" Amara's voice breaks. "How does Zara do it? How does she love them knowing they're dying?"

"Same way we're loving each other," David says quietly. "Knowing doesn't make love wrong. Makes it more important."

Amara turns to him. This man she married. This man she abandoned. This man who waited, who's trying again, who's teaching her presence through his steady quiet existence.

"I love you," she says. "I always loved you. I'm sorry I disappeared."

"You're here now."

"I'm here now."

She kisses him. They move to the bedroom. Make love for the first time in a decade—awkward, emotional, real. Everything she forgot bodies could be—vulnerable, present, alive.

After, lying tangled together, Amara cries. Not sad exactly. Just: feeling everything. The ten years wasted. The five years remaining. The love that persisted. The connection restored.

"We don't have enough time," she whispers.

"We have what we have," David says.

"Five years."

"Five years to love. Five years to be present. Five years to do it right."

"Think that's enough?"

"I don't know. But it's ours."

Amara curls against him. Her brilliant mind—trained to calculate, analyze, solve—finally quiet. Not because she found answers. Because she stopped needing them.

The asteroid is coming. 1,643 days. She knows the exact trajectory. Knows the impact point. Knows the physics of extinction.

But right now, lying with David, feeling his heartbeat, breathing his breath—the knowledge doesn't matter.

This matters.

Being here matters.

Love matters.

Everything else is calculation.

And she's done calculating.

---

Year 10 becomes Year 11. Four years left.

Amara works the arrays with David. They're partners again—in work, in life, in presence. They talk constantly. Share silence comfortably. Touch casually. Sleep tangled together.

The monitoring facility sends automated requests: come back, we need you, the data requires analysis.

She ignores them.

The asteroid doesn't need her analysis. It's coming regardless. The only thing that needs her is David. And herself. And presence.

She's learning.

One evening, walking in the preserve, David says, "I'm nervous about meeting your family."

"Why?"

"Because I wasted ten years. Because I was a ghost."

"You're not a ghost anymore. Neither am I." Amara squeezes his hand. "Zara will love you. The children will love you. And even if we wasted ten years—we're not wasting these four."

"No. We're not."

They walk until tired. Go home. Cook dinner together. Clean together. Exist together.

It's ordinary. Mundane. Perfect.

Amara Okafor, who spent her life chasing extraordinary understanding, finally learns: ordinary is enough.

Ordinary is everything.

Four years of ordinary.

Four years of coffee mornings and array maintenance and preserve walks and tangled sleeping and just: being together.

Four years to love.

Four years to be present.

Four years to live before dying.

Not enough.

But everything.

Always everything.

Outside, the asteroid approaches. Inside, Amara stops calculating and starts living.

Finally.

At last.

With David beside her.

With time enough to matter.

With love enough to be real.

With presence enough to be everything.

The monitoring facility sits empty. The data goes unanalyzed. The calculations go unrefined.

And Amara Okafor—brilliant scientist, problem-solver, analyst—learns the only thing that matters:

Being here.

Being present.

Being alive.

Being human.

Being loved.

Being.

Just: being.

For four years.

Starting now.
