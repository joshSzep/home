# Chapter 9 - Zara

The birth rates have collapsed.

Zara sees the statistics at work—she still goes to the water management facility three days a week, maintaining systems that might not matter in fourteen years but matter now. The global fertility rate dropped 87% in the first three months after the detection. Pregnancies are terminated. Couples stop trying. Why bring a child into a world that's ending?

She understands the logic. She does.

But three months after the detection, Zara tells Kwame she wants another baby.

They're in bed, Maya finally asleep after an hour of questions. Why is the sky different? Why do people cry all the time? Why did Auntie stop visiting?

"I want to have another child," Zara says into the darkness.

Kwame is silent for a long moment. "What?"

"I want another baby. Before it's too late."

He sits up, turns on the light. Looks at her like she's lost her mind. "Zara. The world is ending. In fifteen years, everyone dies. Including Maya. Including us. You want to bring another child into that?"

"Yes."

"Why? So they can die even younger? So we can watch two children grow up knowing they'll never be adults?"

Zara sits up too. She's been thinking about this for weeks. Since her conversation with Professor Wei in the garden, the old woman's words echoing: *Do flowers not bloom in autumn?*

"Because I'm forty-one years old," she says. "Because I have maybe four more years where I can safely carry a child. Because life creates life—that's what it does. Because I want to choose creation instead of resignation. Because—" Her voice breaks. "Because Maya will die at seventeen. And I can't stop that. But I can give her a sibling. I can fill the house with life instead of waiting for death."

"That's not fair to the child."

"Is fifteen years of life worse than no life? Is it more cruel to exist briefly than to never exist?"

Kwame runs his hands over his face. He looks exhausted. Everyone looks exhausted now. "I don't know. I don't know what's cruel anymore. I don't know what anything means."

"Exactly." Zara takes his hand. "Nothing means what it used to mean. So we get to choose what it means now. And I choose life. I choose defiance. I choose to say that even though the world is ending, we're not done yet. We're not giving up yet."

"People will think we're crazy."

"People already think we're crazy for not—" She gestures vaguely. Several neighbors have already died by suicide. Others fled Lagos trying to outrun what can't be outrun. "Everyone's handling this differently. This is how I want to handle it. By creating instead of destroying. By saying yes to something."

Kwame is quiet for a long time. Then: "You're sure?"

"Yes."

"We'd have two children to watch die. Two children who'll never grow up. Never have their own children. Never—"

"I know. Believe me, I know. But Kwame, we're alive right now. Maya is alive right now. And if we have another child, they'll be alive too. For fifteen years. That's not nothing. That's a life."

He looks at her—really looks at her. She sees the war in his eyes. Fear and hope. Resignation and defiance.

Finally, he nods. "Okay. If this is what you need. If this is how you survive this. Then okay."

They conceive two weeks later.

---

The pregnancy is controversial.

Zara's colleagues at work whisper. Some supportive, some horrified. One woman—older, no children—confronts her directly.

"How can you do that? Bring a child into this? It's cruel."

"Crueler than dying childless in fifteen years?" Zara shoots back. "Crueler than spending our last years with nothing to live for?"

"You have Maya."

"And now I'll have two children. Two reasons to get up every morning. Two people to love with everything I have. You think that's cruel? I think it's human."

The woman walks away shaking her head.

Professor Wei, on the other hand, is delighted.

"You're pregnant!" The old woman's face lights up when Zara tells her. They're in Wei's garden—Maya playing with the lemon tree, Zara sitting on the bench, hand on her barely-showing belly.

"You think I'm crazy too."

"No. I think you're brave. And I think you're choosing the most difficult path. It would be easier to give up. To stop creating. To wait for death quietly. But you're choosing life. Even temporary life. Even doomed life. That's extraordinary."

"Everyone else thinks I'm selfish."

"You are selfish." Wei smiles. "In the best way. You're insisting on your own meaning, your own choice, even when the universe says none of it matters. That's what it means to be human. We create meaning where there is none. You're creating life where there's death. It's beautiful."

Zara starts crying. Pregnancy hormones, grief, relief—she doesn't know anymore. Wei takes her hand.

"This child will die young," the old woman says gently. "Maya will die young. You know this. It will be harder than anything you've faced. But you'll have fifteen years of love. That's not nothing."

"Everyone keeps saying that. 'It's not nothing.' But it's not much either. Fifteen years. No future. No hope."

"Hope was always temporary," Wei says. "We just pretended it was permanent. Your children will live fifteen years of presence. Of being loved. Of experiencing wonder. Most humans live eighty years and never fully wake up. Your children will be awake for every moment they have. That's a gift, Zara. A terrible, beautiful gift."

Maya runs over, lemon blossom in her hand. "Mama! Look! It smells pretty!"

Zara takes the blossom. Breathes in the scent. Her daughter's face shining with delight. Her hand on her belly where another life grows.

"It does smell pretty," she says. "Thank you, sweetheart."

Later that night, alone in the bathroom, Zara looks at herself in the mirror. Forty-one years old. Pregnant with her second child. Fourteen years and nine months until impact.

She places both hands on her belly and whispers, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry the world is ending. I'm sorry you won't grow old. But I'm not sorry you'll exist. I'm not sorry you'll be loved. I'm not sorry for choosing you."

The baby can't hear her yet. But Zara needs to say it anyway.

She's choosing defiance.

Even if everyone else thinks she's wrong.

Kofi is born six months after the detection.

The delivery is straightforward—Zara's second birth, her body knows what to do. Kwame is there. Maya stays with Professor Wei during the labor, then comes to meet her brother at the hospital.

The three-year-old stares at the tiny infant in wonder. "He's so small!"

"You were small once too," Zara says, exhausted and elated.

"Really?"

"Really. You were exactly this tiny."

Maya reaches out carefully to touch Kofi's hand. His tiny fingers curl around her finger reflexively. "He's holding me!"

Zara watches her daughter's face. Joy, pure and uncomplicated. Not thinking about fifteen years. Not calculating how long she has. Just: present, delighted, in love with her baby brother.

This is what Zara wanted. This moment. This connection. This life.

The nurse comes in to check vitals. She's professional but cool. Disapproving, maybe. Or maybe just exhausted like everyone else.

"Congratulations," she says, but it sounds hollow.

Zara doesn't care. She's holding her son. Maya is holding his hand. Kwame is crying happy tears.

They have a family. A growing family. In a dying world.

It's absurd and perfect.

---

Three months later, Maya asks the question Zara has been dreading.

They're in the living room. Kofi on his play mat, making baby noises. Maya building a tower with blocks. Zara folding laundry—maintaining routines, maintaining normalcy.

"Mama, when I'm big, will I hold babies like you hold Kofi?"

Zara's hands freeze on a tiny shirt.

Maya looks up at her, innocent and curious. Not trying to hurt. Just asking.

Will she be a mother? Will she hold babies? Will she grow up and have a family?

No. No. No.

Maya will die at seventeen. Will never be a mother. Will never hold her own child. Will never grow up at all.

But Zara can't say that. Can't put that knowledge on a three-year-old. Won't take her daughter's present away by forcing her to understand her future.

So she lies.

"Yes, sweetheart. When you're big, you can hold babies."

Maya smiles and goes back to her blocks.

Zara finishes folding the laundry. Puts Kofi down for a nap. Checks that Maya is occupied with her toys.

Then she goes to the bathroom, locks the door, and collapses on the floor.

The sobs come hard and silent. She bites her hand to keep from making noise. Cries until she's shaking. Until there's nothing left.

Her daughter will never hold babies. Will never be big. Will never grow up.

But she's alive now. Building block towers. Loving her baby brother. Experiencing joy.

That has to be enough.

Zara washes her face, steadies her breathing, and goes back to her children.

---

That night, after both kids are asleep, Zara sits with Kwame on their small balcony.

The Lagos skyline stretches before them. Some lights still on. Some districts dark. The city is changing—some people leaving, some systems failing, some life continuing stubbornly.

"Maya asked if she'd hold babies when she's big," Zara says quietly.

Kwame closes his eyes. "What did you say?"

"I lied. I said yes. I couldn't—I couldn't tell her."

"She's three. She doesn't need to know yet."

"When does she need to know? Five? Seven? Ten? When do I tell my daughter that she's going to die young? That everything she hopes for won't happen? That the future everyone pretends is there doesn't exist?"

Kwame takes her hand. "I don't know. But not at three. Let her be three. Let her be a kid as long as possible."

"She'll never be an adult. She'll die at seventeen. She'll never fall in love, never have her own children, never—"

"I know." Kwame's voice breaks. "Believe me, I know. I think about it every day. Both of them. They're going to die young. It's the worst thing I can imagine. But Zara, they're here now. They're alive now. And we get fifteen years with them. That's what we have. That's all any parent ever really has—the present moment with their kids. We just know the end date. Everyone else just pretended they didn't."

Zara leans against him. They sit in silence, holding hands, listening to the city.

"Do you think we made a mistake?" she asks. "Having Kofi?"

"I don't know. Ask me in fifteen years."

"We won't be able to answer in fifteen years."

"Then ask me tomorrow. And the day after. And every day. Some days I'll say yes, it was a mistake. Some days I'll say no, it was the best thing we did. Today?" He squeezes her hand. "Today I'm glad he exists."

"Even though he'll die at fourteen?"

"Even though. Because he's here. Because Maya loves him. Because you smile when you hold him. Because life is still happening in our house. That's not nothing."

"Everyone keeps saying that. 'It's not nothing.'"

"Because it's true. It's not everything. But it's not nothing."

They sit together watching the city. Watching the lights flicker. Watching the world continue and collapse simultaneously.

Inside, both their children sleep. Alive. Growing. Temporary.

Like everything else.

Six months after Kofi's birth, Zara's sister finally calls.

They haven't spoken in months. Amara is drowning in work, buried in calculations, distant and cold. Zara has stopped trying as hard—her sister needs space, apparently. Space to waste her life on equations that don't matter.

But today, Amara calls.

"I heard you had the baby."

"Six months ago. His name is Kofi."

"I'm sorry I didn't—" Amara stops. Starts again. "Congratulations."

"Are you congratulating me or judging me? Because half the world thinks I'm a monster for having him."

Silence on the line. Then: "I don't know what I think. I don't know what anything means anymore. But if you wanted another child, I'm... I'm glad you have him. I guess."

It's not much. But it's something.

"How are you?" Zara asks.

"Working. Tracking. The same."

"Amara, there's no solution. You said so yourself. Why are you still—"

"I don't know. I don't know why I'm still working. I don't know why I'm doing anything. I just... I keep going."

Zara hears the exhaustion in her sister's voice. The emptiness. "You should come visit. Meet Kofi. See Maya. She asks about you."

"I can't. Not yet. Too much work."

"Work that doesn't matter."

"I know."

"Then come anyway."

"I can't."

After the call ends, Zara holds Kofi and cries. Her sister is wasting the time they have left. Hiding behind work. Pushing away everyone who loves her.

But Zara can't fix her. Can't force her to live differently.

All Zara can do is love her own family. Raise her children. Choose life every day.

Even when it feels impossible.

One year after Kofi's birth, Zara takes both children to Professor Wei's garden.

Maya is four now. Kofi is learning to walk, stumbling around on chubby legs. Wei is one hundred sixteen, frailer than ever but still sharp, still present.

The old woman watches Kofi toddle toward the lemon tree. "He's beautiful."

"Thank you."

"And you? How are you managing?"

"Some days I'm okay. Some days I can't breathe from grief. But I keep going. For them." Zara watches Maya help Kofi reach a low-hanging lemon. "Was I wrong to have him?"

"There is no wrong or right anymore," Wei says gently. "Only choices. You chose life. Someone else might choose differently. Neither is incorrect."

"But he'll die so young. Fourteen. He'll barely be a teenager."

"And Maya will die at seventeen. And you and Kwame in your fifties. And I'll die sometime in the next few years if my body holds out. We're all dying young now, Zara. The asteroid took away old age. But it didn't take away childhood. Kofi gets to be a child. That's real. That matters."

Maya comes running over. "Mama! Kofi picked a lemon!"

"That's wonderful, baby."

Kofi toddles after his sister, lemon clutched in his fist, face proud.

Zara watches them. Her children. Her impossible, doomed, precious children.

"I love them so much it hurts," she whispers.

"I know," Wei says. "That's what love is when you know it's temporary. It's always been temporary. You're just awake to it now."

"Will it get easier?"

"No. But you'll get stronger. You'll learn to hold the joy and the grief simultaneously. You'll learn to be present even when the future is impossible. You'll teach them how to live, not just how to die. That's your work now."

Zara takes a shaky breath. "I don't know how."

"None of us do. We're all learning. But you're choosing to learn through love. That's brave."

Maya and Kofi are laughing now, chasing each other in circles. Kofi falls down, Maya helps him up. The simple, ordinary magic of children playing.

Fourteen years left. Thirteen years left. Time running out.

But right now, in this moment, they're alive.

They're here.

And Zara chose that.

She'll never regret it.

Even when it breaks her heart.

Especially then.
