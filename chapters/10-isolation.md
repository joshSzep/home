# Chapter 10 - Isolation

The monitoring station is empty.

Amara Okafor sits alone at her workstation, updating trajectory calculations that don't need updating. The screens glow in the darkness. Numbers scroll past. The asteroid approaches at 31 kilometers per second, exactly as predicted five years ago.

Nothing has changed. Nothing will change.

The impact date is precise: 3040, late September. The location is known: Pacific Ocean, 2,000 kilometers west of Ecuador. The outcome is certain: extinction.

Amara has calculated it ten thousand times. Has verified it, checked it, rechecked it.

Still calculates.

Still updates.

Still shows up every day to track the approach of an asteroid that cannot be stopped.

Why?

She doesn't know anymore.

###

The solar array stretches two hundred meters across the ice shelf. Five years ago, sixty technicians maintained this section. Today: David Chen, two others he rarely sees, and forty-seven maintenance robots.

The robots are better colleagues.

David climbs the support strut, checking connection points by muscle memory. Platform twelve needs recalibration—the diagnostics flagged it three hours ago. Unit 47B glides along the adjacent rail, its sensor array rotating. David has worked with 47B for eighteen months. It never complains. Never despairs. Never asks why they're maintaining solar arrays for a world with ten years left.

It just maintains.

"Morning, 47B," David says. His voice sounds strange—he hasn't spoken to anyone in three days.

The robot's acknowledgment tone beeps twice. *Colleague detected. Resuming coordinated maintenance protocol.*

David smiles. Not happiness, exactly. Recognition.

The connection housing is corroded. David unseals it carefully. The array still generates ninety-seven percent efficiency. Everything still works perfectly. Everything still functions for a future that won't come.

47B extends a manipulator arm, offering him the replacement component before he asks. They've done this repair forty-six times together. The robot knows the sequence.

"Thanks," David says.

*Component optimal. Installation time: four minutes.*

David installs it in three.

###

Five years.

Five of her fifteen years, spent in this facility. Tracking. Monitoring. Calculating the same trajectories over and over.

The first year, Amara told herself it was necessary. Someone needed to maintain the systems. Someone needed to watch.

The second year, she admitted it was obsession. Work to avoid feeling. Numbers to avoid grief.

The third year, she realized it was meaningless. The systems were automated. The tracking happened whether she watched or not.

Years four and five, she kept coming anyway. Habit. Inertia. Because not coming would mean facing everything she'd been avoiding.

So she calculates.

The facility that once housed sixty scientists now has Amara and two others. Chen, a young engineer. Rodriguez, an older analyst who works night shifts. They nod at shift changes. Exchange no words.

Everyone else quit, fled, or died.

The monitoring systems don't need humans. AI handles the calculations. Automated tracking updates constantly. The data flows whether anyone watches or not.

But Amara watches anyway.

Today she's updating the impact simulation. She's run it a thousand times. Knows exactly what happens. Asteroid strikes Pacific. Fireball. Tsunami. Impact winter. Extinction.

The numbers never change.

She runs it again anyway.

###

The work continues through the polar day—twelve hours straight, David and 47B and the endless arrays. Platform sixty-seven needs cleaning. Platform ninety-two has a loose mounting bracket. Platform one-oh-three's monitoring system needs software update.

David does it all. 47B assists perfectly.

They move along the rail together. The other two human technicians—Novak and Singh—are somewhere in the northern sector. David sees them during shift changes, sometimes. They nod. He nods back. No one tries to talk.

What would they say?

At hour thirteen, David's comm unit buzzes.

"Chen here," he says.

"David." Amara's voice. Clinical, distant. "When will you be home?"

Home. Their apartment in the residential sector, fifteen kilometers from the arrays. They've lived there together for six years. They've been strangers for five.

"Late," he says. "Platform one-twenty needs—"

"You said late yesterday. And the day before."

David checks his schedule. She's right. He's been pulling sixteen-hour shifts for... when did that start? Week ago? Month?

"The arrays need maintenance," he says.

"The arrays will be here tomorrow." Amara's voice is flat, stating facts. "Will you?"

"I'm always here."

Silence. Then: "I know. That's the problem."

The comm clicks off.

###

At home, David is making dinner.

Amara comes home at 11pm. The food is cold. David is reading in the living room.

"Hi," she says.

"Hi."

"Sorry I'm late."

"It's okay."

They move around each other like ghosts. Polite. Distant. Careful not to collide.

Five years ago, they were married. Loved each other. Had a life together.

Now they're roommates. Strangers sharing space. Both drowning separately.

"Did you eat?" David asks.

"I had nutrient bars at the facility."

"You should eat real food."

"I'm not hungry."

"Okay."

He goes back to reading. She goes to the bedroom. They occupy the same apartment but live in different worlds.

She knows this is wrong. Knows they're wasting their remaining time. Knows she should reach out, reconnect, try to repair what's broken.

But she doesn't have the energy.

So she sleeps. Wakes at 5am. Goes back to the facility.

Repeats.

###

David stands on platform one-oh-three, staring at the monitoring system's display. Version 7.2.4 is installing. Progress bar: sixty-three percent.

Behind him, 47B waits patiently for the next task. Around him, forty-seven maintenance robots continue their routes. The whole system functioning perfectly, meaninglessly, endlessly.

He could go home. Leave the arrays to the robots—they'd maintain them fine. Better than fine. They'd maintain them optimally, without breaks, without meaning, without wondering why.

But what would he do at home? Sit in the apartment with Amara, both of them going through the motions? Her at her workstation, running calculations that don't matter. Him on the couch, not watching whatever's on screen. Two people in the same space, separated by a distance measuring instruments can't detect.

It's easier here. The work is honest. It doesn't pretend to mean anything.

Progress bar: eighty-four percent.

"Chen to Operations," David says into his comm. "Extending shift. I'll secure sector seven before end of cycle."

The operations AI acknowledges. No questions.

47B's sensor array rotates. *Query: Human Chen efficiency decline observed. Rest period recommended.*

"I'm fine."

*Biometric data indicates elevated cortisol, decreased cognitive function, suboptimal hydration. Rest period strongly recommended.*

"I said I'm fine."

*Acknowledged. Maintenance protocol resuming.*

They work through hour sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. The sun circles the horizon, never setting. David's hands move automatically. His mind empties of everything except the sequence.

This is sustainable, he thinks. This is livable.

Isn't it?

###

Once a month, Zara calls.

Amara's sister. The one who chose differently. Who had a second child after the detection. Who's raising two doomed children with joy and presence.

Amara doesn't understand it.

The call comes on a Tuesday evening. Amara almost doesn't answer. But Zara is persistent.

Her sister's face appears on the screen. Smiling. How is she smiling?

"Amara! Finally! You're so hard to reach."

"I've been busy."

"Busy with what? You said there's no solution. What are you doing all day?"

"Monitoring. Tracking. Updating calculations."

"Why?"

Amara doesn't have an answer. "Someone needs to."

"The systems are automated. You've told me that. You're choosing to hide."

"I'm not hiding. I'm working."

"On what? What is there to work on?"

Amara feels anger rising. "What am I supposed to do, Zara? Have children and pretend it's fine? Play in gardens while the world ends? I'm a scientist. I solve problems. This problem can't be solved, so I—"

"So you waste five years tracking it anyway instead of living."

"Living how? How do you live when you know exactly when and how you'll die?"

"Like this." Zara turns the screen. Shows Maya and Kofi playing. Maya is seven—reading to her younger brother. Kofi is four—listening intently, asking questions. Both alive, present, engaged.

"They're going to die," Amara says flatly.

"I know. Maya at seventeen. Kofi at fourteen. I know exactly how long I have with them. And I choose to spend that time being present. Teaching them. Loving them. Not perfectly—I fail constantly. But I try. I'm here with them. Not hiding in work that doesn't matter."

"My work matters."

"Does it? You told me five years ago there's no solution. Has anything changed?"

"No."

"Then what are you doing?"

Amara feels something cracking inside her. "I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to live like you. I don't know how to be present when the future is extinction. I don't know how to love when everything ends. I don't know—" Her voice breaks.

Zara's face softens. "Amara. I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you. You're my sister. I love you. And you're wasting your remaining time."

"I know."

"Then stop."

"I don't know how."

"Start with one thing. Go home early. Eat dinner with David. Talk to him. Reconnect. He's right there and you're losing him."

"I've already lost him."

"You haven't. Not yet. But you will if you keep this up."

###

Hour nineteen, platform one-forty-seven, David's hands slip. The connection housing drops, tumbles down the support strut, crashes on the ice seventy meters below. Not dangerous—just clumsy. Just fatigue.

47B's sensor array focuses on him. *Human Chen: error rate increase detected. Rest period mandatory per safety protocol.*

"I can finish sector seven."

*Negative. Safety parameters exceeded. Shift termination required.*

The robot is right. David knows it's right.

"Fine," David says. "Shift terminated."

He takes the transit back to residential sector—fifteen kilometers across the ice shelf. Through the window, he watches the solar arrays pass: two hundred platforms, eight thousand panels, generating power for twelve thousand people. The settlements house maybe three thousand now.

The ones who stayed are the ones who need function. David understands them. He is them.

###

Two weeks later, Amara stays at the facility for 48 hours straight.

Not because the work requires it. Because going home means facing David. Means facing her wasted years. Means feeling everything she's been avoiding.

So she doesn't go home.

Just works. Sleeps at her desk for a few hours. Wakes up. Works more.

Chen finds her on hour 36. "Dr. Okafor, you should go home."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You look terrible. When did you last eat?"

"Yesterday. Maybe."

He brings her food. Forces her to eat. Sits with her while she does.

"Why are you still here?" he asks. "Not just today. In general. Why do you keep coming?"

"Because someone needs to monitor—"

"No. The systems monitor themselves. We both know that. So why?"

Amara stares at the food. "Because if I stop, I'll have to face everything I've been avoiding. My marriage. My sister. My niece and nephew I've barely met. The fact that I wasted five years calculating instead of living. And I'm not ready to face that."

"Will you ever be ready?"

"I don't know."

Chen is quiet for a moment. "My husband left me in Year 2. Said he didn't want to spend the remaining time with someone who was already dead inside. He was right. I was dead inside. Still am, mostly. I come here because it's easier than being alone with myself. Easier than feeling."

"Does it work?"

"No. But I keep doing it anyway."

###

The apartment is dark when David enters. For a moment, he thinks Amara's asleep—it's past midnight, though the sun's still up outside. But then he sees her silhouette on the couch, not moving, just sitting in the dark.

"Hey," he says.

"Hey."

He stands in the doorway, unsure. They've perfected this dance—two people sharing space without touching, speaking without communicating.

It doesn't feel like anything.

"You want food?" he asks.

"I'm not hungry."

He moves to the kitchen anyway, opening the refrigerator more for something to do than actual hunger.

"David."

He turns. Amara hasn't moved from the couch, still just a silhouette.

"I got a call from Zara today," she says. "Video call. She showed me Maya and Kofi—they're getting so big. Maya's seven now. She drew this picture of our family... she included you, even though she's never met you."

David doesn't know what to say.

"Zara asked when we were coming to visit," Amara continues. "I said we're busy with work. She laughed. She said, 'Work for what? We're dying. Come see your niece and nephew before there's no time left.'"

The refrigerator hums. The apartment's climate system whispers.

"Do you want to visit them?" David asks.

"I don't know what I want." Amara's voice is so flat it hurts to hear. "I don't know anything anymore. I just know... this isn't living. This is just... we're just functioning. Like your robots."

David closes the refrigerator. Moves to the couch, sits on the other end—carefully maintaining distance.

"The robots are good at functioning," he says.

"I know. You tell me. Every time you come home, which is almost never, you tell me about 47B and the maintenance protocols and how efficient the systems are." She turns to look at him. Her face is gaunt in the darkness. "But you're not a robot, David. Neither am I. And we're dying like this."

"Everyone's dying."

"Yes. But we're dying alone. Together and alone."

David looks at his hands. Calloused from the work, scarred from five years of climbing struts and opening housings and maintaining arrays that don't need this much maintenance.

"I don't know how to do anything else," he says quietly.

"Neither do I," Amara says. "But I think... I think we're supposed to figure it out anyway. Before there's no time left."

They sit in silence. The apartment hums. Outside, the sun circles the horizon, and the solar arrays keep generating power, and the robots keep maintaining them, and everything functions perfectly toward an end that makes all function meaningless.

David's comm unit buzzes—maintenance alert. He reaches for it automatically, then stops.

"I should go," he says, not moving.

"Yes," Amara says. "You should."

But she doesn't move either.

They sit there together, two ghosts in a dark apartment, going through motions, executing protocols, functioning without living.

###

At hour 47, Amara finally goes home.

David is there. Making breakfast—or lunch, she's not sure what time it is anymore.

He looks at her. Takes in her appearance. Doesn't say anything.

"I'm sorry," she manages.

"For what?"

"For disappearing. For staying at the facility. For—everything."

"It's okay."

"It's not okay."

David sets down the spatula. Looks at her directly. "No. It's not okay. But what am I supposed to do? Force you to come home? Force you to talk? Force you to be here when you clearly don't want to be?"

"I want to be here."

"Do you? Because you were gone for two days, Amara. Didn't answer my messages. Just vanished into work. Again."

"I know. I'm sorry. I just—I can't stop. I know it's meaningless. I know the work doesn't matter. I know I'm wasting time. But I can't stop."

"Why?"

"Because if I stop, I have to feel everything. And I'm not ready."

"When will you be ready?"

"I don't know. But David—" She steps toward him. "I don't want to lose you. I don't want to waste our remaining time. I'm trying. I just don't know how."

He's quiet for a long time. Then: "I don't know either. I've been functioning on autopilot for five years. Going to work. Maintaining systems. Coming home. We're both just going through motions. Both wasting time differently."

"How do we stop?"

"I don't know."

They stand in the kitchen together. Two people who used to love each other. Who got married believing in a future. Who now share an apartment and nothing else.

"I'm tired," Amara says quietly. "I'm so tired of calculating trajectories. Of tracking an asteroid I can't stop. Of wasting days and weeks and years on work that doesn't matter."

"Then stop."

"I don't know how."

"Neither do I. But maybe we figure it out together. Maybe we waste the next five years too. Or maybe we try something different."

"What?"

"I don't know. But we have nine years left. That's not nothing. That's enough time to—to try. To reconnect. To be something other than ghosts."

Amara feels tears coming. Five years of held-back emotion. Five years of calculated numbness.

"I wasted five years," she whispers.

"So did I."

"We can't get them back."

"No. But we don't have to waste the next nine the same way."

They stand together in the kitchen. Not touching yet. But present. Both here. Both acknowledging the waste. Both wondering if there's another way.

It's not a solution. Not a plan. Not even hope, really.

Just: an acknowledgment that what they've been doing isn't working.

That maybe something else is possible.

That nine years is long enough to try.

###

That night, Amara doesn't go to the facility.

She stays home. Sits with David on the couch. They don't talk much. Just: present in the same room. Not on separate planets anymore.

It's uncomfortable. She keeps thinking about the facility. About the trajectories that need updating.

But she stays.

The next morning, she goes to the facility. Updates the systems. But comes home at a reasonable hour.

David is there. They eat dinner together. Actually together, not separate ghosts.

It's awkward. They've forgotten how to be married.

But they're trying.

Small steps. Tiny adjustments. Not fixing five years of damage overnight.

Just: showing up. Being present. Trying something different than drowning separately.

###

David thinks about 47B, gliding along the rails without hesitation, maintaining arrays because that's what it does, never asking why, never needing meaning, just: function.

He envies the robot.

He fears he's becoming it.

"I don't know how long I can keep doing this," he says one evening.

"I don't either," Amara says.

They sit in the dark together, not touching, not speaking, two people who used to be married, who used to love each other, who might still love each other under all the numbness and distance and mechanical function.

But neither of them knows how to bridge the gap anymore.

Neither of them knows if they can.

The asteroid continues its approach. The countdown continues. The extinction remains certain.

But Amara starts coming home at night. Starts being in the same room as her husband. Starts trying to remember what connection felt like.

David starts taking shorter shifts. Starts eating dinner with Amara. Starts being something other than a maintenance function.

They don't know if it will work.

But nine years is enough time to try.

Maybe.

The polar sun circles. The arrays generate power. The question remains:

Is this sustainable?

The robots would say yes. Function continues. Therefore function succeeds.

But David isn't a robot.

Amara isn't a robot.

Not yet.

Not completely.

And nine years is too long to spend as ghosts.

So they try. Small steps. Awkward attempts. Failing often. Trying anyway.

The work continues. The asteroid approaches. The countdown ticks downward.

But in the apartment, in the spaces between work and sleep, two people start remembering how to be human.

Start remembering how to be together.

Start trying to live.

It's not much.

But it's something.

And something is more than the nothing they've had for five years.

So they keep trying.

Day by day.

Together and alone.

Learning how to be both.
