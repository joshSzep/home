# Chapter 18 - Amara

The monitoring station is empty.

Amara Okafor sits alone at her workstation, updating trajectory calculations that don't need updating. The screens glow in the darkness. Numbers scroll past. The asteroid approaches at 31 kilometers per second, exactly as predicted five years ago.

Nothing has changed. Nothing will change.

The impact date is precise: 3040, late September. The location is known: Pacific Ocean, 2,000 kilometers west of Ecuador. The outcome is certain: extinction.

Amara has known this for five years. Has calculated it ten thousand times. Has verified it, checked it, rechecked it.

Still calculates.

Still updates.

Still shows up every day to track the approach of an asteroid that cannot be stopped.

Why?

She doesn't know anymore.

---

Five years.

Five of her fifteen years, spent in this facility. Tracking. Monitoring. Calculating the same trajectories over and over.

The first year, she told herself it was necessary. Someone needed to maintain the systems. Someone needed to keep accurate records. Someone needed to watch.

The second year, she admitted it was obsession. Work to avoid feeling. Numbers to avoid grief. The facility as escape from everything else.

The third year, she realized it was meaningless. The systems were automated. The tracking happened whether she watched or not. She wasn't needed. Wasn't helping. Just... present.

Years four and five, she kept coming anyway. Habit. Inertia. Because not coming would mean facing everything she'd been avoiding.

So she calculates.

Updates coordinates. Refines trajectory models. Watches the countdown tick downward.

Ten years left. Then nine years, eleven months. Then nine years, ten months.

The asteroid continues its approach.

Amara continues watching it.

Both inevitable. Both unstoppable. Both meaningless.

---

The facility that once housed sixty scientists now has Amara and two others.

Chen, a young engineer who checks the hardware systems once a week. He barely speaks. Comes in, runs diagnostics, leaves.

And Rodriguez, an older analyst who works night shifts. Amara sees her occasionally during shift changes. They nod at each other. Exchange no words.

Everyone else quit, fled, or died.

The monitoring systems don't need humans. AI handles the calculations. Automated tracking updates constantly. The data flows whether anyone watches or not.

But Amara watches anyway.

Today she's updating the impact simulation. She's run this simulation a thousand times. Knows exactly what happens. Asteroid strikes Pacific. Fireball. Tsunami. Impact winter. Extinction.

The numbers never change.

She runs it again anyway.

Watches the visual display. The asteroid approaching. The impact. The shockwave spreading across the planet. The temperature dropping. The light fading.

She knows exactly how she'll die. Exactly when. Exactly why.

Does that make it better or worse?

---

At home, David is making dinner.

He still does this. Maintains routines. Cooks meals. Cleans on schedule. As if normalcy matters.

Amara comes home at 11pm. The food is cold. David is reading in the living room.

"Hi," she says.

"Hi."

"Sorry I'm late."

"It's okay."

They move around each other like ghosts. Polite. Distant. Careful not to collide.

Five years ago, they were married. Loved each other. Had a life together.

Now they're roommates. Strangers sharing space. Both drowning separately.

"Did you eat?" David asks.

"I had nutrient bars at the facility."

"You should eat real food."

"I'm not hungry."

"Okay."

He goes back to reading. She goes to the bedroom. They occupy the same apartment but live in different worlds.

She knows this is wrong. Knows they're wasting their remaining time. Knows she should reach out, reconnect, try to repair what's broken.

But she doesn't have the energy.

So she sleeps. Wakes at 5am. Goes back to the facility.

Calculates trajectories that don't need calculating.

Watches the countdown.

Repeats.

---

Once a month, Zara calls.

Amara's sister. The one who chose differently. Who had a second child after the detection. Who's raising two doomed children with joy and presence.

Amara doesn't understand it. Doesn't understand how Zara functions. How she finds meaning in parenting children who'll die young. How she's not paralyzed by grief.

The call comes on a Tuesday evening. Amara almost doesn't answer. But Zara is persistent, and guilt eventually wins.

Her sister's face appears on the screen. Smiling. How is she smiling?

"Amara! Finally! You're so hard to reach."

"I've been busy."

"Busy with what? You said there's no solution. What are you doing all day?"

"Monitoring. Tracking. Updating calculations."

"Why?"

Amara doesn't have an answer. "Someone needs to."

"The systems are automated. You've told me that. You're not needed there. You're choosing to hide."

"I'm not hiding. I'm working."

"On what? What is there to work on?"

Amara feels anger rising. "What am I supposed to do, Zara? Have children and pretend it's fine? Play in gardens while the world ends? I'm a scientist. I solve problems. This problem can't be solved, so I—"

"So you waste five years tracking it anyway instead of living."

"Living how? How do you live when you know exactly when and how you'll die?"

"Like this." Zara turns the screen. Shows Maya and Kofi playing in a room. Maya is seven—reading a book to her younger brother. Kofi is four—listening intently, asking questions. Both alive, present, engaged.

"They're going to die," Amara says flatly.

"I know. Maya at seventeen. Kofi at fourteen. I know exactly how long I have with them. And I choose to spend that time being present. Teaching them. Loving them. Not perfectly—I fail constantly. But I try. I'm here with them. Not hiding in work that doesn't matter."

"My work matters."

"Does it? You told me five years ago there's no solution. Has anything changed?"

"No."

"Then what are you doing?"

Amara feels something cracking inside her. "I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to live like you. I don't know how to be present when the future is extinction. I don't know how to love when everything ends. I don't know—" Her voice breaks.

Zara's face softens. "Amara. I'm not judging you. I'm worried about you. You're my sister. I love you. And you're wasting your remaining time."

"I know."

"Then stop."

"I don't know how."

"Start with one thing. Go home early. Eat dinner with David. Talk to him. Reconnect. He's right there and you're losing him."

"I've already lost him."

"You haven't. Not yet. But you will if you keep this up. You're choosing work over marriage. Calculations over connection. Death over life."

"That's not fair."

"Maybe not. But it's true."

After the call, Amara sits in the empty facility.

Zara is right. She knows Zara is right. She's wasted five years. Buried herself in work. Avoided David, avoided grief, avoided everything.

She should go home. Should talk to David. Should try to reconnect before it's too late.

Instead, she pulls up the trajectory calculations.

Updates the coordinates.

Checks them again.

The asteroid continues its approach.

Amara continues watching.

Both on predetermined paths. Both unable to change course.

Both heading toward inevitable ends.

---

Two weeks later, Amara stays at the facility for 48 hours straight.

Not because the work requires it. Because going home means facing David. Means facing her wasted years. Means feeling everything she's been avoiding.

So she doesn't go home.

Just works. Sleeps at her desk for a few hours. Wakes up. Works more.

Chen finds her on hour 36. "Dr. Okafor, you should go home."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You look terrible. When did you last eat?"

"Yesterday. Maybe."

He brings her food from the cafeteria. Forces her to eat. Sits with her while she does.

"Why are you still here?" he asks. "Not just today. In general. Why do you keep coming?"

"Because someone needs to monitor—"

"No. The systems monitor themselves. We both know that. So why?"

Amara stares at the food. "Because if I stop, I'll have to face everything I've been avoiding. My marriage. My sister. My niece and nephew I've barely met. The fact that I wasted five years calculating instead of living. And I'm not ready to face that."

"Will you ever be ready?"

"I don't know."

Chen is quiet for a moment. "My husband left me in Year 2. Said he didn't want to spend the remaining time with someone who was already dead inside. He was right. I was dead inside. Still am, mostly. I come here because it's easier than being alone with myself. Easier than feeling."

"Does it work?"

"No. But I keep doing it anyway."

They sit together in the empty facility. Two people hiding from life by tracking death. Two scientists monitoring an asteroid they can't stop because monitoring feels like something, even if it isn't.

After Chen leaves, Amara pulls up her messages. Finds the last one from David, sent two days ago:

*Where are you? Are you coming home?*

She should respond. Should say yes, I'm coming home. Should leave right now and go to him.

Instead, she runs the impact simulation again.

Watches the asteroid strike. Watches the extinction event unfold. Watches humanity end.

Ten years left. Then nine years, nine months, twenty-eight days.

Then nine years, nine months, twenty-seven days.

The countdown continues whether she watches or not.

But she watches anyway.

Because watching feels like something.

Even if it's nothing.

---

At hour 47, Amara finally goes home.

David is there. Making breakfast—or lunch, she's not sure what time it is anymore.

He looks at her. Takes in her appearance. Doesn't say anything.

"I'm sorry," she manages.

"For what?"

"For disappearing. For staying at the facility. For—everything."

"It's okay."

"It's not okay."

David sets down the spatula. Looks at her directly. "No. It's not okay. But what am I supposed to do? Force you to come home? Force you to talk? Force you to be here when you clearly don't want to be?"

"I want to be here."

"Do you? Because you were gone for two days, Amara. Didn't answer my messages. Just vanished into work. Again."

"I know. I'm sorry. I just—I can't stop. I know it's meaningless. I know the work doesn't matter. I know I'm wasting time. But I can't stop."

"Why?"

"Because if I stop, I have to feel everything. And I'm not ready."

"When will you be ready?"

"I don't know. But David—" She steps toward him. "I don't want to lose you. I don't want to waste our remaining time. I'm trying. I just don't know how."

He's quiet for a long time. Then: "I don't know either. I've been functioning on autopilot for five years. Going to work. Maintaining systems. Coming home. We're both just going through motions. Both wasting time differently."

"How do we stop?"

"I don't know."

They stand in the kitchen together. Two people who used to love each other. Who got married believing in a future. Who now share an apartment and nothing else.

"I'm tired," Amara says quietly. "I'm so tired of calculating trajectories. Of tracking an asteroid I can't stop. Of wasting days and weeks and years on work that doesn't matter."

"Then stop."

"I don't know how."

"Neither do I. But maybe we figure it out together. Maybe we waste the next five years too. Or maybe we try something different."

"What?"

"I don't know. But we have nine years left. That's not nothing. That's enough time to—to try. To reconnect. To be something other than ghosts."

Amara feels tears coming. Five years of held-back emotion. Five years of calculated numbness.

"I wasted five years," she whispers.

"So did I."

"We can't get them back."

"No. But we don't have to waste the next nine the same way."

They stand together in the kitchen. Not touching yet. But present. Both here. Both acknowledging the waste. Both wondering if there's another way.

It's not a solution. Not a plan. Not even hope, really.

Just: an acknowledgment that what they've been doing isn't working.

That maybe something else is possible.

That nine years is long enough to try.

---

That night, Amara doesn't go to the facility.

She stays home. Sits with David on the couch. They don't talk much. Just: present in the same room. Not on separate planets anymore.

It's uncomfortable. She keeps thinking about the facility. About the trajectories that need updating. About the monitoring systems.

But she stays.

The next morning, she goes to the facility. Updates the systems. But comes home at a reasonable hour.

David is there. They eat dinner together. Actually together, not separate ghosts.

It's awkward. They've forgotten how to be married.

But they're trying.

Small steps. Tiny adjustments. Not fixing five years of damage overnight.

Just: showing up. Being present. Trying something different than drowning separately.

The asteroid continues its approach. The countdown continues. The extinction remains certain.

But Amara starts coming home at night. Starts being in the same room as her husband. Starts trying to remember what connection felt like.

She doesn't know if it will work.

But nine years is enough time to try.

Maybe.
