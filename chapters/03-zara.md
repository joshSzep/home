# Chapter 3 - Zara

Maya was building a tower.

It was almost as tall as she was—two years old, still unsteady on her feet but determined—each colored block placed with careful concentration. Zara sat on the floor beside her, ready to catch her daughter if she toppled, marveling at the fierce focus on that small face.

"Look, Mama!" Maya pointed at her creation. "Big!"

"So big," Zara agreed, smiling. "Almost as big as you."

The emergency broadcast interrupted them mid-laugh.

Every screen in the apartment activated simultaneously—walls, kitchen display, even Zara's work tablet. The global AI system alert, priority one. Zara had never seen it used in her entire life.

EXTINCTION-LEVEL ASTEROID DETECTED, the text flashed. IMPACT PROBABILITY 99.97%. ESTIMATED TIME TO IMPACT: 15 YEARS, 2 MONTHS, 14 DAYS.

Zara stared at the display. Read it again. The words didn't make sense. They were individual words she understood—asteroid, impact, extinction—but together they formed something impossible.

A video feed replaced the text. Some official from the UN Monitoring Program, speaking with careful precision about trajectories and verification protocols and deflection scenarios that had all failed. Numbers appeared: the asteroid's size, its velocity, the energy it would release on impact.

Zara's engineering training kicked in automatically. She understood the scale of energy release. Understood what "civilization-killer" meant in practical terms. Understood that when they said "extinction-level" they meant exactly that.

In fifteen years, everything would end.

"Mama?" Maya's small hand tugged at her sleeve. "Mama, what's wrong?"

Zara looked at her daughter. Two years old. She'd been planning Maya's third birthday party. Had already enrolled her in the early learning program for next year. Had been thinking about what schools she'd attend, what she'd study, what she'd become.

In fifteen years, Maya would be seventeen.

She'd never turn eighteen. Never fall in love. Never have children of her own. Never become the brilliant, kind person Zara could already see forming in her toddler's fierce independence and quick curiosity.

Seventeen years old, and then nothing.

"Mama?" Maya's voice was scared now. "Why are you crying?"

Zara hadn't realized she was crying. She pulled Maya into her arms, holding her so tight that Maya squirmed and protested.

"Mama, too tight!"

Zara loosened her grip but didn't let go. Couldn't let go. She grabbed her comm with shaking hands and called Kwame.

He answered on the first ring. "Zara—"

"Come home." Her voice came out strangled. "Come home right now."

"I'm on my way." She could hear the panic in his voice, the sounds of chaos in the background at his work site. "Is Maya—"

"We're fine. We're—" She stopped. Were they fine? The world was ending. "Just come home. Please."

She ended the call and immediately dialed Amara. Her older sister, brilliant Amara who understood space and asteroids and orbital mechanics. Amara who would tell her this was a mistake, a false alarm, that they'd calculated wrong.

Amara answered. She looked terrible—exhausted, hollowed out.

"Zara—"

"Is it real?" Zara interrupted. "Tell me it's not real. Tell me they made a mistake."

Amara's face on the screen was answer enough, but she said it anyway: "It's real."

"Can they stop it? Can you—can anyone—"

"No."

That one word. So simple. So final.

"But Maya—" Zara's voice broke completely. "She's two. She's only two. She'll be—"

"Seventeen." Amara's voice was flat, clinical. Like she was discussing data instead of her niece's death. "I know."

"How can you be so calm?" The words came out harsh, angry. "How can you just—"

"I've known for three hours," Amara said quietly. "I'm the one who detected it. I've run every calculation. There's nothing we can do."

Zara started sobbing. Couldn't help it. Couldn't stop it. Maya was patting her face now, confused and frightened by her mother's tears.

"I'm sorry," Amara said. She looked like she wanted to say more but had nothing else to offer. "I'm so sorry. I wanted to call you before the global alert went out, but—"

"I have to go." Zara couldn't keep talking. Couldn't keep looking at her sister's devastated face. "Kwame's coming home. I have to—"

She ended the call.

For a long moment, she just sat on the floor with Maya in her lap, surrounded by scattered building blocks, watching the broadcasts continue on every screen. Different channels, different voices, all saying the same impossible thing: The world was ending. Fifteen years. Extinction certain.

Maya wiggled free and went back to her tower. She didn't understand. She was two. How could she possibly understand?

How was Zara supposed to explain this to her? Not today—Maya was too young. But eventually. "Sweetheart, you're going to die when you're seventeen, and there's nothing Mama can do to stop it."

The door burst open. Kwame, breathless, wild-eyed. He looked at Zara sitting on the floor, looked at Maya playing innocently with her blocks, looked at the screens still broadcasting news of the end.

"Zara—"

She stood up and walked into his arms. He held her, and she held him, and they stood there in their living room while their daughter played at their feet and their future collapsed around them.

"What do we do?" Kwame whispered.

"I don't know."

They stayed like that until Maya got frustrated with a block that wouldn't balance and called for help. Then they separated, and Zara knelt down to help her daughter build a tower that would last until bedtime, in a world that would last fifteen more years.

The hours that followed were a blur.

The screens kept broadcasting—Mayor Torres giving a speech from Antarctica, other leaders around the world, scientists explaining the orbital mechanics, religious leaders offering various forms of comfort or condemnation. Zara stopped watching. Couldn't bear it.

She focused on Maya instead. Fed her lunch. Put her down for a nap. Normal routine in an abnormal day. Maya resisted, overstimulated by her parents' distress, but finally fell asleep clutching her favorite stuffed elephant.

Zara stood in the doorway of Maya's bedroom, watching her daughter sleep. She looked so small in the bed they'd bought her last month—a "big girl bed" because she was growing up so fast. Growing into a future that didn't exist.

"We should leave Lagos." Kwame's voice behind her, quiet so as not to wake Maya. "Go to Antarctica maybe. Or the highlands. Somewhere safer."

"Safer from what? An asteroid?"

"From the chaos that's coming. You saw the broadcasts. There's already rioting in some cities. If this gets worse—"

"It will get worse." Zara turned to face him. Her husband of seven years, father of her child, the man she'd planned to spend her whole life with. Except her whole life was now fifteen years. "Everything's going to get worse. Where are we going to go that's safe from the end of the world?"

Kwame had no answer for that.

Zara's comm chimed. She ignored it. It chimed again. And again. Messages flooding in—friends, colleagues, family, everyone reaching out or breaking down or asking questions she couldn't answer.

One message made her pause. Professor Wei, her elderly neighbor.

*Come over when you can. Bring Maya. Garden is peaceful.*

Zara looked at Kwame. "Will you watch her? I need to—I need to talk to someone."

"Go. I'll be here."

She kissed him and slipped out into the hallway. The apartment complex was usually bustling—Lagos District was densely populated, the converted cityscape full of life and energy. Today it was eerily quiet, everyone inside processing the same impossible news.

Professor Wei's door was open. The old woman sat in her small garden—just a balcony really, but she'd filled it with plants and made it beautiful. She was 114 years old, had lived through the Forever Earth acceptance, the climate migrations, the building of Antarctica. She'd seen humanity reckon with being trapped on one small planet.

Now she sat among her flowers, looking peaceful.

"Zara," she said warmly. "Come sit."

Zara sat on the bench beside her. For a moment neither of them spoke. A butterfly landed on one of the flowers—an actual butterfly, gene-designed for the new climate, one of the small wonders of their transformed world.

"My daughter is going to die," Zara said finally. "She's two years old and in fifteen years she's going to die and I can't stop it."

"Yes," Wei said simply.

"I don't know how to live with that. I don't know how to parent her knowing—knowing—"

"Knowing she will die?" Wei turned to look at her with those ancient, kind eyes. "Zara, she was always going to die. We all die."

"Not like this. Not at seventeen. Not with certainty."

"The certainty is new," Wei acknowledged. "The death was always inevitable."

Zara wanted to scream at her, at the calm acceptance in her voice. But Wei had lived 114 years. She'd buried friends, family, her husband. She'd been practicing death her entire life.

"I had such plans," Zara whispered. "For Maya. For what she'd become. I designed her genes myself—selected for health, longevity, intelligence. I wanted to give her every advantage. I wanted her to live to 150, to see things I'll never see, to—" Her voice broke. "What's the point now?"

"The point is she's here." Wei gestured at the apartment behind them. "Right now, in there, sleeping peacefully. That's the point."

"For fifteen years."

"For today." Wei's voice was gentle but firm. "You have today with her. That's all any parent ever really has. Tomorrow isn't promised. You thought it was, but it never was."

Zara felt something crack open in her chest. "How do I do this? How do I raise her knowing she'll never grow up?"

"The same way you would have raised her anyway. You love her. You teach her. You be present with her." Wei reached over and took Zara's hand. "The asteroid didn't change what matters. It just made it visible."

They sat together in the garden, in the afternoon sun of Lagos District, while the world came apart around them and Zara tried to imagine a future that had just shrunk to fifteen years.

"I should get back," she said eventually. "Maya will wake up soon."

"Come visit again," Wei said. "Bring her. Children should see flowers."

"Why? If the world's ending—"

"*Because* the world's ending." Wei smiled. "Everything ends, Zara. That's not tragedy. That's just truth. The flower blooms anyway. So does Maya."

---

Three months passed.

The world didn't end, but it fractured. Suicides spiked globally—people choosing their own timing rather than waiting for the asteroid. Birth rates plummeted. Why bring children into a dying world? Economies destabilized. Some people quit their jobs, abandoned responsibilities. Others clung to routine like it could save them.

Zara kept working, though the water systems felt pointless now. Why maintain infrastructure that would exist for fifteen years and then vapor? But someone had to do it, and idle time meant thinking about Maya's shrinking future, so she worked.

She watched other parents fall apart. In her building alone, three families had left—fleeing to the highlands, to Antarctica, to anywhere that felt safer. It didn't matter where they went. The asteroid would find them.

One evening, after putting Maya to bed, Zara sat with Kwame on their balcony. Lagos stretched out below them, the towers and terraces of the rebuilt city glittering in the dusk. Somewhere out there, millions of people were facing the same questions she was.

"I want another baby," she said.

Kwame looked at her like she'd lost her mind. "What?"

"I want to have another child. Another baby."

"Zara. The world is ending."

"I know." She turned to face him fully. "That's why I want to. Maya should have a sibling. She should have someone with her. And we have fifteen years. That's enough time to have a baby, to raise them, to—"

"To what? Watch them die as children? That's cruel."

"Living is cruel now. Everything is cruel. But I choose it anyway." Zara felt the certainty settling in her bones, the defiance that had been building since Wei told her that flowers bloom anyway. "I want to create life. Even now. *Especially* now. Because if life only matters when it lasts forever, then it never mattered at all."

Kwame stared at her. "You're serious."

"Yes."

"People will think we're crazy."

"I don't care what people think." She took his hand. "I want this. I want Maya to have a sibling. I want us to be a family, even if it's for fifteen years instead of fifty. I want to choose life in the face of death. Is that insane?"

"Probably." Kwame's eyes were wet. "But maybe we're all insane now. Maybe you have to be insane to keep living when you know the end is coming."

"So you'll do it? You'll have another baby with me?"

He pulled her close. "Yeah. Yeah, okay. If we're going to face the end of the world, let's face it as a family."

Zara kissed him, and for the first time since the detection, she felt something other than despair. Hope was too strong a word. But maybe... defiance. Maybe choice.

The next morning, she made an appointment at the genetic design center. The staff looked at her like she was broken. Birth applications had dropped by 95% globally. The centers were nearly empty.

"Are you sure?" the counselor asked, professional but clearly disturbed. "Given the circumstances—"

"I'm sure." Zara filled out the application with steady hands. Selected traits for their second child—health, temperament, intelligence. All the advantages that wouldn't matter in fifteen years. She selected them anyway.

When she got home, she told Wei about her decision.

The old woman smiled. "Do flowers not bloom in autumn?"

"What?"

"Life creates life. That's what it does. Even at the end. Especially at the end." Wei touched Zara's hand. "You create life in the face of death. That's courage, Zara. That's what it means to be alive."

Three months later, Zara was pregnant.

Six months after that, nine months after the detection, her son was born. They named him Kofi—born on Friday, a name that meant gentle strength.

Some people called her cruel. Some called her insane. Some just stared with incomprehension. She didn't care. She held her newborn son and her two-year-old daughter and felt defiant and terrified and fiercely, impossibly alive.

Maya leaned over the baby and said, "He's tiny!"

"You were tiny once too," Zara told her.

"When I'm big, will I hold babies?"

The question broke Zara's heart. No. Maya would die at seventeen. She'd never be a mother. She'd never hold her own children.

But Zara smiled and said, "Yes, sweetheart."

Later, she cried while Kwame held her. "She'll never have children. She'll die at seventeen and she'll never—"

"I know." He was crying too. "I know."

"But we have fifteen years," Zara said, pulling herself together. "Fourteen now. We have fourteen years to love them. That's more than some people get. It has to be enough."

She looked at her children—Maya building towers with her blocks, Kofi sleeping in his crib. Both of them temporary. Both of them doomed.

Both of them hers.

"I'll make it enough," she whispered. "I'll make every moment matter."

And she picked up Maya, settled beside Kofi's crib, and started telling them a story about flowers that bloomed in autumn, beautiful and brief and exactly enough.
