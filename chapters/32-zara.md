# Chapter 32: Zara

Three weeks after Wei's death, Maya asks the question.

They're in the kitchen—Zara cooking plantains, Maya chopping vegetables, Kofi setting the table. Normal evening. Except nothing's normal anymore. Year 12. Three years until the asteroid. Three weeks since the first death Maya and Kofi ever experienced.

"Mama," Maya says. She's fourteen now, tall and thoughtful, more mature than Zara was at her age. "Wei was ready. She said so. Will we be ready?"

Zara's knife pauses mid-slice. Kofi stops folding napkins, watching his mother.

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "Wei lived 126 years. She had time to be ready. You'll be seventeen. Kofi will be thirteen. I'll be fifty-three. Ready feels... impossible."

"But we could try?" Maya asks. "Like Wei tried? She practiced her whole life. We could practice for three years?"

"We could practice being present. That's what Wei taught. Not being ready—being here."

"What's the difference?"

Zara sets down the knife, turns to face her daughter fully. "Ready means prepared for what's coming. Present means here with what is. Wei was both. We might only get to be one."

"Which one matters more?"

"Wei would say: presence. Always presence."

Maya nods slowly. Behind her, Kofi says quietly, "I miss Wei."

"I know, baby. I miss her too."

"Will we miss each other? After?"

The question lands like a blow. Zara crosses the kitchen, pulls Kofi into her arms. He's eleven, still small enough to hold. Not for much longer.

"No," Zara says firmly. "We won't miss each other. Because we'll be together. All four of us. Papa, you, Maya, me. Together until the end. And then... no missing. Just: together."

"Promise?"

"Promise. We'll be in Antarctica. With Auntie Amara. With Uncle David. With all the people we love. No one dies alone. No one gets left behind."

Kofi nods against her chest. Maya wipes her eyes. The plantains burn slightly, filling the kitchen with smoke.

Normal evening. Impossible conversation. Three years left.

---

After dinner, after the children are in bed, Zara and Kwame sit on their small balcony.

Lagos at night, Year 12. Power's intermittent now—most of the city dark. Stars visible for first time in generations. Beautiful and terrible.

"Maya asked if we'll be ready," Zara says.

"Are we?"

"No. But I told her we'll be together. That's enough."

Kwame takes her hand. They've been married sixteen years. Made it through detection, crisis, Kofi's birth, Wei's death. Still together. Still choosing each other.

"When do we go?" he asks.

"Soon. Few months. Infrastructure's failing fast. If we wait too long, we won't make it."

"Antarctica in Year 15. Final year. Final months."

"Amara says we can stay with them. There's room. The children will love it—all that snow, all that open space. Maya can help with the solar arrays. Kofi can explore."

"And then?"

"Then we're together. In the preserve, probably. All of us. Watching."

Kwame is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I'm not ready either. But I'm glad we had them. Maya and Kofi. Even knowing. Glad we chose this."

"Me too. Every day, even the hard days. Me too."

They sit holding hands, watching stars, feeling Lagos breathe its last years around them. The city that birthed them both. That won't last. That never was going to last, even before the asteroid.

Wei knew that. Taught it. Died proving it.

Now Zara must live it. For three more years. With her children. Her husband. Her sister who finally stopped hiding.

Not ready.

But present.

That's enough.

Has to be.

---

Month later, Zara takes the children to the old school.

It's been closed for years—no point teaching when there's no future. But the building stands, and Zara has keys. She was a teacher here once. Before Maya was born. Before everything.

They walk through empty classrooms. Desks covered in dust. Chalkboards still showing lessons from years ago. *Photosynthesis. Chemical Reactions. The Water Cycle.*

All true. All irrelevant now.

"This is where I taught," Zara says in what was her classroom. "Biology. I loved it—showing students how life works, how it adapts, how it persists."

"Does it persist?" Maya asks. "Life?"

"On Earth? No. The asteroid ends it. But life as concept? Maybe. If there are other worlds. Other species. We'll never know. But: possible."

"Does that comfort you?"

"Sometimes. When I remember we're not special. When I remember Earth life is just one attempt. The universe is large. Might be others."

Kofi runs his hand over a desk, leaving trails in the dust. "What did you teach about death?"

Zara sits on her old desk. "I taught that death is part of life. That organisms die so ecosystems can continue. Individual death serving collective life."

"But now collective death too?"

"On Earth. Yes. Individual and collective, same day. But Kofi—everything I taught was still true. Death was always part of life. The asteroid doesn't change this. Just: makes it visible. Complete."

Maya sits beside her mother. "Wei said impermanence isn't tragedy. It's truth. Is that what you taught too?"

"Yes. I taught it scientifically. She taught it philosophically. Same truth, different language." Zara looks around the empty classroom. "I miss teaching. I loved watching students understand. That moment when concept becomes clear. Beautiful."

"You still teach," Maya says. "You teach us. Every day. How to cook, how to think, how to be present. You're still a teacher."

"To an audience of two."

"Best audience you ever had."

Zara laughs—surprised by joy in this dusty room. "You're right. Best students too. Most important class I'll ever teach."

"What's the final lesson?" Kofi asks.

"Same as the first lesson: pay attention. Look closely. Be here. Everything else is detail."

They sit together in the empty classroom. Teacher and students. Mother and children. Three people who exist because Zara chose defiance over despair.

Not ready for ending.

But present for now.

That's enough.

Wei said so.

Science says so.

Truth says so.

---

Weeks pass. Lagos continues. Barely.

Infrastructure fails in cascades. Power unreliable. Water sporadic. Transport impossible. But: people persist. Year 12. Three years left. Might as well persist.

Zara teaches Maya and Kofi everything she knows.

How to read the sky. How to identify plants. How to tell stories. How to cook. How to love. How to grieve. How to be present when presence is all you have.

Maya absorbs it all. Fourteen years old, becoming someone extraordinary. Zara watches her daughter and feels pride so fierce it hurts. Brief life. Profound life. Both true.

Kofi learns differently—through play, through movement, through laughter. Eleven years old, still child enough to find joy. Zara watches him and feels gratitude so deep she could drown in it. He exists. Against all logic, all advice, all fear. He exists.

Kwame works part-time—maintaining solar arrays that barely function. Comes home exhausted. But present. Always present. They make love carefully, tenderly, holding each other like precious things.

Because they are precious. Because everything is precious. Because three years isn't enough but it's what they have.

One evening, letter arrives from Amara.

Physical letter—networks too unreliable for digital. Months old. Stained from journey. But: here.

*Zara,*

*Come soon. Come now if you can. Infrastructure won't last much longer. I need to see you. I wasted so much time. I won't waste more.*

*There's room here. Space for all four of you. David and I have a house—small, but enough. The children will love Antarctica. Different world. Beautiful world. Last world.*

*I'm sorry I withdrew. I'm sorry I hid. I'm sorry I made you face this alone.*

*Come home. To me. To Antarctica. Let's be sisters again. Let's face it together.*

*Please.*

*I love you.*

*Amara*

Zara reads it three times. Cries. Calls family meeting.

"Auntie Amara wants us in Antarctica," she says. "Invited us to stay with her and Uncle David. We'd leave in months. Travel Year 13. Arrive with two years left. Be there for the end."

"Can we go?" Maya asks immediately.

"Do you want to?"

"Yes. I want to meet Auntie properly. I want to see snow. I want to see where you grew up, kind of. I want to be with family."

"Kofi?"

The boy considers. "Will there be penguins?"

"Some. Not many left. But some."

"Then yes."

"Kwame?"

Her husband nods. "Your sister finally stopped hiding. She's brave enough to face you again. We should be brave enough to go."

"Okay," Zara says. "Okay. We go. Few months. As soon as we can arrange transport. We leave Lagos. We go to Antarctica. We finish this together."

The decision made. The path set. The ending chosen.

Not ready.

But moving toward it anyway.

Present in the journey.

That's enough.

---

Three months later, they pack.

Not much to bring—travel's difficult, space is limited, possessions don't matter. But:

Photos. Of Wei, of family, of Lagos, of life that was.

Books. Maya's favorites, Kofi's collection, Kwame's engineering texts, Zara's biology references.

Clothes. Practical. Warm. Antarctica's cold.

Letters. From Amara, from friends, from students Zara taught.

Wei's letter. *The flower bloomed. That's enough.*

Journal. Zara's kept one since detection. Fifteen years of thoughts, fears, joys, grief. Fifteen years of being present.

That's it. That's everything that matters. Everything else—house, furniture, dishes, decorations—stays. Someone else can use them. Or no one. Doesn't matter.

They leave on a transport ship—one of the last running. Lagos to Cape Town to Antarctic coast. Weeks of travel. Dangerous. Necessary.

The children are excited. Kwame is steady. Zara is terrified and relieved in equal measure.

Leaving home. Going home. Both true.

Lagos disappears behind them—the city that shaped her, raised her, held her. She'll never see it again. Grieves it already.

But ahead: Amara. Sister. Finally. After years of distance. After years of pain.

Sisters facing the end together.

That's worth leaving for.

That's worth everything.

---

The journey takes six weeks.

Ship barely functions. Stops frequently. Crew nervous but competent. Passengers quiet—everyone traveling for last things. Reunions. Goodbyes. Final witnesses.

Maya stands at the rail for hours, watching ocean. She's never seen this much water. Zara watches her daughter watch the world and memorizes it. Every angle. Every expression. Every moment.

Kofi makes friends with crew. They teach him knots, navigation, mechanical repairs. He's brilliant with his hands. Would have made excellent engineer. Will make excellent engineer. For two more years.

Kwame holds Zara at night in their tiny cabin. They don't talk much. Just: hold each other. Presence. Always presence.

One night, storm hits. Ship rocks violently. Children scared. Crew working frantically.

Zara holds Maya and Kofi, whispers: "Together. We're together. That's what matters."

The storm passes. They survive. Keep going.

Everything is metaphor now. Everything is practice.

Storm comes. You hold each other. You survive. You keep going.

Until you can't.

But not yet.

Still going.

Still here.

---

Antarctica appears on the horizon—white and vast and impossible.

"Mama," Kofi breathes. "It's so big."

"It's the last continent," Zara says. "The last place humans could survive. And barely."

They dock at McMurdo. Disembark carefully. Ground is ice—slippery, dangerous, real.

And there, waiting on the dock: Amara.

Zara sees her sister and everything breaks open.

They run to each other—awkward, crying, laughing. Embrace hard enough to hurt. Eighteen years apart in age. Seven years apart in distance. Now: together.

"I'm sorry," Amara says. "I'm so sorry. I wasted so much time."

"You're here now. That's enough."

"I missed you. I missed everything. I was so scared and I hid and I'm sorry."

"I'm here. We're here. Look—" Zara pulls back, gestures to her family. "Kwame. Maya. Kofi. Your family. Finally."

Amara looks at them—niece and nephew she's never met, brother-in-law she barely knows. Her face crumples with regret and joy.

"Hi," Maya says. "I'm Maya. I'm so glad to meet you."

"I'm Kofi. You have penguins here?"

Amara laughs through tears. "Some. Yes. I'll show you."

Behind Amara: David. Quiet, kind, weathered by work and time. He nods to Zara.

"Thank you for coming," he says. "Amara needed you. We all need each other now."

"Thank you for having us," Zara says.

They walk from the docks through McMurdo—small district, failing infrastructure, two thousand people holding on. To the house Amara and David share. Small. Warm. Enough.

Inside, they sit together. Six people. Two sisters. One brother-in-law. One husband. Two children.

Family. Finally. Completely.

Amara makes tea. Maya asks about solar arrays. Kofi explores every corner. Kwame talks engineering with David. The adults watch children be children and grieve how briefly.

Later, after dinner, after Kofi and Maya are in bed, Amara and Zara sit alone.

"I can't believe you're here," Amara says.

"I can't believe you invited us. After everything."

"I was so wrong. I thought being alone was safer. Thought not loving was safer. I was so wrong."

"You found David. You reconnected. You're here now. That's what matters."

"Wei's death changed you?"

"Yes. She died ready. Peaceful. I watched her go and learned: this is practice. Her individual death before our collective death. She showed me how it's done."

"I'm not ready," Amara admits quietly.

"Neither am I. But we're together. That's enough."

Amara takes Zara's hand. Sisters. Finally. Facing what comes together.

"I'm so glad you're here," Amara whispers.

"Me too. Me too."

Outside, Antarctica stretches in all directions. Inside, family breathes together.

Two years left.

Two years to be present.

Two years to love fiercely.

Then: together at the end.

Not ready.

But present.

That's enough.

Wei taught it.

Now they live it.

Together.

Sisters.

Family.

Home.

Finally home.

The flower bloomed.

Still blooming.

Two more years of blooming.

Then: fade.

But present now.

Real now.

Mattering now.

Together.

Always together.

That's enough.

Always was.

Always will be.

For two more years.

Then—

But not yet.

Present now.

Together now.

Home now.

Enough.
