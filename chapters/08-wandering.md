# Chapter 8 - Wandering

The prayer beads feel like stones.

Ibrahim Amir sits in the militia camp outside Jerusalem, holding *misbaha*—ninety-nine beads for ninety-nine names of God. He's held them since he was a boy. Wore them in combat. Prayed with them after every raid.

Three years since the asteroid was detected. Three years since he prayed and felt anything.

Now the beads are just weight. The prayers just words. The faith just... gone.

Around him, the camp prepares for evening prayer. His brothers bow toward Mecca, foreheads to the ground, surrendering to Allah's will. They believe completely. Believe this land is sacred. Believe martyrdom leads to paradise. Believe God is watching.

Ibrahim used to believe that too.

Now he doesn't know what he believes.

The imam approaches as others leave. Sits uninvited. "Brother Ibrahim, you weren't at prayer again."

"I was thinking."

"Thinking is good. But prayer is necessary."

"Is it?" The question comes out sharper than intended.

The old man's face shows concern, not anger. "You've been troubled since the detection. But Ibrahim—don't let the asteroid steal your faith. That's a death before death."

"What's the point of faith when everyone dies anyway? Muslims, Christians, Jews, atheists—all the same ending. The land we're fighting for will be destroyed. If this is Allah's plan, what are we? Just puppets until we're vaporized?"

"We cannot understand Allah's purpose—"

"Then what use is faith?" Ibrahim stands. "I'm sorry, imam. I don't mean to offend. But I can't force belief anymore."

The imam leaves shaking his head. Ibrahim sits alone with his broken faith and his prayer beads that feel like stones.

###

Kenji Torres sits in a Buddhist temple in Lagos, trying to empty his mind.

The monks chant morning prayers—hypnotic, ancient, meant to lead to enlightenment. Around him, incense smoke curls. Meditation cushions line perfect rows. Everyone breathing together, seeking liberation.

Kenji feels nothing.

This is his third week here. Before that, two months at a Hindu ashram in Mumbai. Before that, six months drifting through spiritual communities across Africa and Asia.

Searching. Always searching.

For what? Meaning. Purpose. A way to live fifteen years that isn't numbing out or drowning in despair.

So far: nothing.

The Buddhist monks teach about impermanence and non-attachment. Let go of craving. Accept that nothing lasts. Find peace in emptiness.

It makes intellectual sense. Kenji can understand the philosophy. But he can't feel it. Can't transform ideas into lived experience.

Maybe he's broken. Maybe some people just can't find meaning in a meaningless universe.

The morning prayers end. An older monk sits beside him.

"You are struggling."

"Yes. I'm trying to let go. Trying to accept impermanence. But I just feel... hollow. Like I'm going through motions."

"Perhaps you are trying too hard. Seeking enlightenment is the obstacle to enlightenment. The grasping itself is the problem."

"So I should stop seeking?"

"Can you?"

Kenji considers this. Can he stop? Stop traveling, stop asking questions, stop trying to find the answer?

"I don't know."

"Then that is your answer. When you are ready to stop seeking, you will stop. Until then, seek. But know that what you seek is already here."

The monk leaves. Kenji sits alone in the temple, surrounded by incense and silence.

*What you seek is already here.*

He doesn't believe that.

But he doesn't know what else to do.

So he keeps traveling.

###

The raid goes badly.

Ibrahim's unit breaks into a Christian militia supply depot—finds it empty. Wasted effort. Wasted risk.

On the way back, they hit a UN checkpoint. The peacekeepers—exhausted, understaffed—just wave them through. No inspection. No confiscation. What's the point anymore?

Everyone knows the world is ending. The UN maintains order out of habit, not hope.

Just like Ibrahim fights out of habit, not faith.

Back at camp, cleaning his weapon, a voice interrupts his thoughts.

"You look like you're cleaning that gun for a funeral."

Ibrahim looks up. A young man stands nearby—mid-twenties, mixed features, clearly not from the camp.

"Who are you?"

"Kenji Torres. I'm staying at the refugee camp down the road. Watching. Trying to understand what's happening here."

"You picked a strange time to visit Jerusalem."

"I noticed." Kenji sits down uninvited. "But I'm trying to understand how people find meaning. You're fighting for holy land that'll be destroyed. Why?"

Most people would be offended. Ibrahim just feels tired.

"Because it's what I do. Who I am. Been a fighter since I was sixteen. Don't know how to be anything else."

"Do you believe in what you're fighting for?"

Ibrahim should defend the cause. Defend the faith.

Instead, he tells the truth. "I used to. Before the asteroid, I believed completely. Knew God was watching. Knew martyrdom led to paradise. Knew the struggle was righteous." He sets down the gun. "Now I don't know. God isn't watching. Or He's watching and doesn't care. Or He doesn't exist. I don't know which is worse."

Kenji is quiet for a moment. "I've been traveling for two years. Trying to find answers. Want to know what I learned?"

"What?"

"No one has answers. Everyone's making it up. Buddhists say let go. Christians say have faith. Humanists say create meaning yourself. Everyone has a different story. None can be proven." Kenji looks at him directly. "But maybe that's okay. Maybe we choose what matters. Maybe meaning isn't given by God. Maybe we decide."

"Without God, how do you decide?"

"I'm still figuring that out. But I think it has to do with being present. With loving what's here while it's here. With accepting impermanence instead of fighting it."

Ibrahim thinks about this. Three years of fighting with eroding faith. Three years of praying and feeling nothing.

"If I'm not a fighter," he says slowly, "who am I?"

"I don't know. But you have twelve years to figure it out."

###

Mumbai is overwhelming.

The megacity is louder than Lagos, more crowded, more intense. Kenji stays at an ashram on the outskirts—a Hindu community dedicated to devotional practice and selfless service.

*Bhakti yoga.* The path of devotion. Surrender to the divine.

Kenji tries. He attends prayers. Learns chants. Studies scriptures. Helps cook meals for the poor. Tries to feel devotion to something, anything.

But he can't force faith.

Can't make himself believe in Krishna or Shiva or any deity watching over humanity. Can't surrender to a divine plan when the divine plan involves everyone dying in twelve years.

The ashram leader—a woman with gray hair and kind eyes—tells him: "Faith is a gift. You cannot force it."

"What if it doesn't come? What do I do then?"

"Find another path. Faith is one way. Not the only way."

"What are the other ways?"

"That's what you're trying to discover. Keep searching."

Kenji stays at the ashram for two months. Learns about Hinduism. Meets beautiful people with genuine faith. Respects them deeply.

But it's not his path.

He leaves Mumbai and continues traveling.

###

Three weeks after they meet, Ibrahim witnesses something that changes everything.

Close combat in a ruined building. Christian militia fighter. The man fights well—trained, experienced. They grapple. Ibrahim's knife finds his throat.

The man falls. Dies quickly.

Ibrahim searches the body—standard procedure. Finds a medallion. Prayer beads. A photograph of children.

The man was a father. A believer. A fighter like Ibrahim.

Thought he was righteous. Thought God was watching. Thought the struggle mattered.

Now he's dead. His children are orphans. His faith doesn't matter. His righteousness doesn't matter.

In twelve years, his children will die too. Everything he fought for: ash.

Ibrahim sits beside the body and vomits.

Not from the violence—he's seen violence. From the absolute meaninglessness of it all.

This man died for nothing. Ibrahim killed him for nothing. They're fighting over land that will be destroyed. Following faiths that promise rewards that won't come.

Everything is nothing.

He stumbles out of the building. His unit is already moving. He follows mechanically.

But he's done.

Not done fighting yet—he doesn't know how to stop. But done believing it matters.

Done pretending God is watching.

Done being certain.

###

They spend two months together. Ibrahim and Kenji. Unlikely friends.

The fighter losing faith. The seeker unable to find it. Two people on opposite journeys, meeting in the middle.

They walk through city ruins. Talk about faith and doubt, meaning and meaninglessness, how to live when the end is certain.

One evening, sitting on rubble overlooking the old city, Ibrahim asks: "Do you ever wish you could just believe again? Like the imam. Like my brothers in the camp. They have certainty. Even if it's false, it's something."

"I tried that," Kenji says. "Went to temples, churches, mosques. Listened to every teacher. Tried to believe in something, anything. Didn't work. Can't force faith. Either it's there or it isn't."

"So what do you do without it?"

"Live anyway. Choose what matters. Love people. Be present. It's harder without certainty. No cosmic meaning, no divine plan, no afterlife promise. Just: this moment, this breath, this conversation. That's all we know we have."

Ibrahim picks up a piece of rubble. Ancient stone. Maybe from a temple. Maybe from a house. Impossible to tell now.

"I've killed men," he says quietly. "Killed them believing I was righteous. Believing God approved. Believing martyrs went to paradise and enemies went to hell." He drops the stone. "What if there's no paradise? What if I killed them for nothing?"

"You killed them for faith. That faith turned out to be false, or at least unprovable. But you weren't lying to yourself. You genuinely believed."

"Does that make it better or worse?"

"I don't know. But carrying guilt forever won't help. You can't undo what you did. You can only decide who to be going forward."

"Who do I be if I'm not a fighter?"

"That's what the next twelve years are for."

They watch the sun set over Jerusalem. Tomorrow, Ibrahim will go on another raid. Will continue fighting because it's what he knows.

But something is shifting.

###

Jerusalem teaches Kenji something important.

He watches the wars escalate. Watches people kill each other with absolute certainty. Watches faith drive people to violence, to martyrdom, to death.

He learns: he doesn't want certainty if certainty leads to this. If absolute faith means being willing to kill for it, he'd rather have doubt.

Doubt is honest. Doubt admits limits. Doubt leaves room for other people's truth.

He respects the faithful—respects Ibrahim's former certainty, respects the Christians and Jews and Muslims who believe deeply. Respects the power of faith to give meaning.

But he can't have it himself.

And maybe that's okay.

One evening, three months after they met, he tells Ibrahim he's leaving.

"Where?"

"Back to Lagos. There's a philosopher there. Professor Wei. Ancient woman, supposedly wise. Someone told me about her a year ago. I'm going to find her. Try to learn from her."

"What if she doesn't have answers either?"

"Then at least I'll have tried. And Ibrahim—" Kenji puts his hand on his friend's shoulder. "You should leave too. This war is meaningless. You know it. Stop fighting for holy ground that'll be destroyed."

"I know. I'm trying to figure out how to stop being a fighter. Not there yet."

"When you are, find me. Antarctica eventually. Or Lagos if I'm still there. We'll figure this out together."

"Together doesn't sound so bad."

They embrace. Brothers in doubt. Friends in the dark.

Kenji leaves Jerusalem the next day.

###

Six months after Kenji leaves, Ibrahim is preparing for another raid when he stops.

Just: stops.

His unit is gearing up. The imam is blessing them. Everyone following the routine they've followed hundreds of times.

Ibrahim sets down his weapon.

"Brother Ibrahim?" someone asks.

"I'm done."

"Done with what?"

"Fighting. This. All of it."

The camp goes quiet. The commander stares at him. "You're abandoning jihad?"

"Jihad for what? For land that will be destroyed? For God who isn't watching? For certainty I don't have anymore?" Ibrahim stands. "I'm done. I don't know what I'll do instead. But I can't kill anymore for something I don't believe in."

"You'll be cast out."

"I know."

"You'll have nothing."

"I have questions. That's more than I had yesterday."

He walks away from the camp. From the fighting. From three years of doubt and seven years before that of false certainty.

He has no plan. No destination. No faith.

But he has questions.

And questions, he's learning, might be more valuable than answers.

###

The journey to Lagos takes three weeks.

Transport systems are degrading. Fewer flights. Longer waits. Everything breaking down slowly.

Kenji uses the time to think.

Two years of traveling. What has he learned?

That no one has *the* answer. Everyone has *an* answer. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, humanism—they're all tools. Different ways of making meaning.

Some people need certainty. Some need surrender. Some need community. Some need philosophy.

Kenji doesn't know what he needs yet. But he's learning what he doesn't need.

He doesn't need absolute faith. Can't force it, wouldn't want it if he could.

He doesn't need certainty. Prefers honest doubt to false confidence.

He doesn't need religion, exactly. But he needs something. Tools. Frameworks. Ways of being present without drowning in despair.

Maybe Professor Wei will have those tools.

Or maybe she'll just have more questions.

Either way, it's the next step.

###

Lagos feels like coming home even though it's not home.

Kenji finds the woman at the market who first told him about Professor Wei months ago.

"You came back."

"I'm looking for Professor Wei. Can you tell me how to find her?"

The woman gives directions. Warns him: "She's very old. Very frail. Doesn't teach formally. But if she agrees to talk with you, listen carefully. She doesn't waste words."

Kenji finds the house in the Yaba District. Small, modest, garden out front. An old woman sits on a bench—impossibly small, white hair, bright eyes.

He approaches carefully. "Professor Wei?"

She looks up. Studies him. "You're the seeker. Elena Torres's son."

"How do you—"

"Your mother and I correspond. She worries about you. Said you were traveling, asking questions, looking for teachers." Wei gestures at the bench. "Sit."

Kenji sits.

A little girl runs past—maybe four years old, chasing a butterfly.

"That's Maya," Wei says. "Her mother Zara lives next door. Maya will die at seventeen. Her brother Kofi at fourteen. Their mother knows this. Still loves them completely. Still raises them with joy. That's meaning-making."

Kenji watches the little girl play. Pure presence. Pure wonder. Completely absorbed in the moment.

"I've been traveling for two years," he says. "Trying to find a way to live fifteen years. Trying to find meaning. I've tried Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam. Nothing works. I can't force faith. Can't surrender. Can't stop questioning."

"Good."

"Good?"

"You've learned what you don't need. That's progress. Most people waste lifetimes clinging to certainty they don't have. You let go quickly. Now you can learn what you do need."

"What do I need?"

"Tools. Not answers. Tools for being present. For accepting impermanence. For making meaning consciously instead of inheriting it. For living without certainty but also without drowning in meaninglessness."

"Can you teach me?"

Wei smiles. "I'm one hundred sixteen years old. I don't teach anymore. Too tired. But you can visit. We can talk. I'll share what I've learned. You take what's useful. Leave the rest."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because you're asking honestly. Because your mother is my friend. Because I have maybe five years left and I'd like to share what I know." She pauses. "And because you remind me of myself at your age. Before I found my own tools. When I was lost and searching and desperate."

"Did you find what you were looking for?"

"No. I learned to stop looking. That's different. Better, actually."

Kenji doesn't fully understand. But he's willing to try.

"When can I start?"

"You already have."

Maya runs past again, laughing at the butterfly. Wei watches her with ancient eyes full of tenderness.

"See that? That's what I'll teach you. How to be like that child. Present. Amazed. Alive. Even knowing it ends."

"How?"

"Come back tomorrow. We'll start."

Kenji stands. Bows slightly. "Thank you, Professor Wei."

"Thank you for asking. Teaching is a gift too. Even when I'm tired."

He walks away from the garden. Toward tomorrow. Toward whatever comes next.

Behind him, Maya catches the butterfly. Shows it to Wei. Lets it go again.

Temporary. Beautiful. Enough.

Maybe that's the answer he's been seeking.

Or maybe that's the beginning of learning to stop seeking.

Either way, it's a start.
