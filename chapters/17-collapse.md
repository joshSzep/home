# Chapter 17 - Collapse

Year 12. Lagos.

Three weeks after Wei's death, Maya asks the question.

They're in the kitchen—Zara cooking plantains, Maya chopping vegetables, Kofi setting the table. Normal evening. Except nothing's normal anymore. Three years until the asteroid. Three weeks since the first death Maya and Kofi ever experienced.

"Mama," Maya says. She's fourteen now, tall and thoughtful, more mature than Zara was at her age. "Wei was ready. She said so. Will we be ready?"

Zara's knife pauses mid-slice. Kofi stops folding napkins, watching his mother.

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "Wei lived 125 years. She had time to be ready. You'll be seventeen. Kofi will be thirteen. I'll be fifty-three. Ready feels... impossible."

"But we could try? Like Wei tried? She practiced her whole life. We could practice for three years?"

"We could practice being present. That's what Wei taught. Not being ready—being here."

"What's the difference?"

Zara sets down the knife, turns to face her daughter fully. "Ready means prepared for what's coming. Present means here with what is. Wei was both. We might only get to be one."

"Which one matters more?"

"Wei would say: presence. Always presence."

Maya nods slowly. Behind her, Kofi says quietly, "I miss Wei."

"I know, baby. I miss her too."

"Will we miss each other? After?"

The question lands like a blow. Zara crosses the kitchen, pulls Kofi into her arms. He's nine, still small enough to hold.

"No," Zara says firmly. "We won't miss each other. Because we'll be together. All four of us. Papa, you, Maya, me. Together until the end. And then... no missing. Just: together."

"Promise?"

"Promise. We'll be in Antarctica. With Auntie Amara. With all the people we love. No one dies alone. No one gets left behind."

###

Year 12. Antarctica.

Ibrahim Al-Rashid climbs the stairs to his fourth-floor apartment in the refugee housing complex.

Fifty-three steps. He counts them. Every day for three years, counting. Therapeutic, the doctors said. Rebuilding strength after the wound. But Ibrahim thinks it's something else. Not therapy. Penance. Or maybe just: attention.

Wei's teaching, filtered through Kenji: pay attention. Be present. Count the steps.

His leg aches. Always will. Piece of shrapnel still lodged near the spine—too dangerous to remove. So: permanent limp. Permanent reminder. You fought for holy ground that won't last. You killed for meaning that wasn't there.

He reaches the fourth floor. Breathes. Continues.

Three years until the asteroid. Thirty-one years old. Faith gone. Fighting gone. Identity gone.

Building something new. Slowly. One step at a time.

###

In Lagos, after dinner, after the children are in bed, Zara and Kwame sit on their small balcony.

Lagos at night, Year 12. Power's intermittent now—most of the city dark. Stars visible for first time in generations. Beautiful and terrible.

"Maya asked if we'll be ready," Zara says.

"Are we?"

"No. But I told her we'll be together. That's enough."

Kwame takes her hand. They've been married sixteen years. Made it through detection, crisis, Kofi's birth, Wei's death. Still together. Still choosing each other.

"When do we go?" he asks.

"Soon. Few months. Infrastructure's failing fast. If we wait too long, we won't make it."

"Antarctica in Year 15. Final year."

"Amara says we can stay with them. There's room. The children will love it—all that snow, all that open space." Zara pauses. "And then we're together. In the preserve, probably. All of us. Watching."

Kwame is quiet for a long moment. Then: "I'm not ready either. But I'm glad we had them. Maya and Kofi. Even knowing. Glad we chose this."

"Me too. Every day, even the hard days. Me too."

###

Morning in Antarctica. Ibrahim's routine: wash, dress, eat. Simple.

No prayer. Can't anymore. He tried, those first months. Went through motions—ritual washing, prostration, words memorized since childhood. But: nothing. Just: body moving. No connection. No God listening.

Or maybe: no God at all.

That thought used to terrify him. Now it just... is.

He makes tea. Sits at his small table. Looks out the window at McMurdo District. Orderly streets, failing infrastructure, two thousand people maintaining civilization for three more years.

Why? Wei would ask. Why maintain it?

And Ibrahim would answer: because we're here. Because it matters now even if it doesn't matter later.

Today he has work. Maintenance job at the community center. Fixing pipes, replacing wiring, keeping systems running that will stop in three years anyway.

Meaningless and meaningful. Both true at once.

###

In Lagos, weeks pass. Infrastructure fails in cascades.

Power unreliable. Water sporadic. Transport impossible. But: people persist. Three years left. Might as well persist.

Zara teaches Maya and Kofi everything she knows. How to read the sky. How to identify plants. How to tell stories. How to cook. How to love. How to grieve. How to be present when presence is all you have.

Maya absorbs it all. Fourteen years old, becoming someone extraordinary. Zara watches her daughter and feels pride so fierce it hurts. Brief life. Profound life. Both true.

Kofi learns differently—through play, through movement, through laughter. Still child enough to find joy. Zara watches him and feels gratitude so deep she could drown in it. He exists. Against all logic, all advice, all fear. He exists.

One evening, letter arrives from Amara. Physical letter—networks too unreliable for digital. Months old. Stained from journey. But: here.

*Zara,*

*Come soon. Come now if you can. Infrastructure won't last much longer. I need to see you. I wasted so much time. I won't waste more.*

*There's room here. Space for all four of you. The children will love Antarctica. Different world. Beautiful world. Last world.*

*I'm sorry I withdrew. I'm sorry I hid. I'm sorry I made you face this alone.*

*Come home. To me. To Antarctica. Let's be sisters again. Let's face it together.*

*Please. I love you.*

*Amara*

Zara reads it three times. Cries. Calls family meeting.

"Auntie Amara wants us in Antarctica," she says. "Invited us to stay with her and Uncle David. We'd leave in months. Travel Year 13. Arrive with two years left. Be there for the end."

"Can we go?" Maya asks immediately.

"Do you want to?"

"Yes. I want to meet Auntie properly. I want to see snow. I want to be with family."

"Kofi?"

The boy considers. "Will there be penguins?"

"Some. Not many left. But some."

"Then yes."

"Okay," Zara says. "Okay. We go. Few months. As soon as we can arrange transport. We leave Lagos. We go to Antarctica. We finish this together."

The decision made. The path set. The ending chosen.

###

Friday afternoon in Antarctica, Ibrahim goes to the mosque.

Small building in the residential district. Converted storage facility. Fifty people praying—down from two hundred Year 1. But: committed. Still faithful despite asteroid. Still believing.

Ibrahim removes his shoes. Enters. Sits in back.

Imam Al-Mazari leads prayer. Old man, refugee from Syria. The prayers begin. Arabic flowing like water. Ibrahim knows every word. Recited them ten thousand times.

Can't recite them anymore.

But he listens. And remembers what it felt like. The certainty. The connection. The sense of something larger than self.

Was it real? He doesn't know. Does it matter? Also doesn't know.

The faithful prostrate. Ibrahim stays seated. Observer, not participant. Witness, not believer.

After prayers, young man approaches. Name's Rashid.

"You come often," Rashid says. "But you don't pray."

"No. I can't anymore. I don't believe."

"But you come anyway?"

"I'm trying to understand what I lost. What you have. Why you keep it."

Rashid sits beside him. He's maybe twenty-two. Grew up after detection.

"I keep it because my parents kept it," Rashid says. "Because it connects me to them, to ancestors, to tradition. Not because I think paradise waits. I don't know what waits. Maybe nothing. But the prayers make me feel connected. To something. To people. To history."

"Does that work? Without paradise?"

"Mostly. Some days it feels hollow. Other days it feels true. Both are okay."

Ibrahim nods. "Thank you. For telling me honestly."

"Thank you for coming. For witnessing. Even if you don't believe."

###

In Lagos, three months later, they pack.

Not much to bring—travel's difficult, space is limited, possessions don't matter. But:

Photos. Of Wei, of family, of Lagos, of life that was.

Books. Maya's favorites, Kofi's collection.

Clothes. Practical. Warm. Antarctica's cold.

Letters. From Amara, from Wei.

Journal. Zara's kept one since detection. Fifteen years of thoughts, fears, joys, grief.

That's it. That's everything that matters. Everything else—house, furniture, dishes—stays. Someone else can use them. Or no one.

They leave on a transport ship—one of the last running. Lagos to Cape Town to Antarctic coast. Weeks of travel. Dangerous. Necessary.

The children are excited. Kwame is steady. Zara is terrified and relieved in equal measure.

Leaving home. Going home. Both true.

###

Saturday in Antarctica, Ibrahim attends Shabbat.

Jewish community's smaller—thirty people in makeshift synagogue. Rabbi Cohen leads. The service is mostly Hebrew. Ibrahim doesn't understand. Just: listens. Observes. Feels.

Afterward, Rabbi Cohen approaches.

"Ibrahim," she says. "You've been coming for months. What draws you?"

"Curiosity. Grief. Understanding."

"You're Muslim?"

"Was. Lost faith Year 9. Now I'm... uncertain."

"Uncertainty is Jewish tradition," she says with a smile. "We argue with God constantly. Even when we believe."

"Can you argue with something you're not sure exists?"

"Better to argue with uncertainty than bow to false certainty."

Ibrahim considers this. "I spent my life certain. Fought for certainty. Killed for certainty. Now: nothing is certain. It's terrifying."

"Of course it is. But maybe: honest?"

"Very honest. Painfully honest."

"The asteroid's coming whether we believe or not. Might as well spend the time thinking deeply."

###

The journey from Lagos takes six weeks.

Ship barely functions. Stops frequently. Crew nervous but competent. Passengers quiet—everyone traveling for last things. Reunions. Goodbyes. Final witnesses.

Maya stands at the rail for hours, watching ocean. She's never seen this much water. Zara watches her daughter watch the world and memorizes it. Every angle. Every expression. Every moment.

Kofi makes friends with crew. They teach him knots, navigation. He's brilliant with his hands. Would have made excellent engineer. Will make excellent engineer. For two more years.

Kwame holds Zara at night in their tiny cabin. They don't talk much. Just: hold each other. Presence. Always presence.

One night, storm hits. Ship rocks violently. Children scared. Crew working frantically.

Zara holds Maya and Kofi, whispers: "Together. We're together. That's what matters."

The storm passes. They survive. Keep going.

Everything is practice now. Storm comes. You hold each other. You survive. You keep going.

Until you can't.

But not yet.

###

Sunday in Antarctica, Ibrahim visits Kenji.

Small apartment, minimal possessions, daily meditation practice. Kenji makes tea ceremonially—Wei taught him. Attention to detail. Presence in small actions.

"Went to mosque Friday," Ibrahim says. "Synagogue yesterday. Christian service this morning."

"What are you learning?"

"That everyone's trying. That no one has answers. That the trying is what matters, maybe."

Kenji nods. "Wei would say: trying implies goal. Better to just: be present. No goal. No achievement. Just: here."

"How do you do that? Be present without purpose?"

"Practice. Meditation. Attention. Failing constantly. Being again."

Ibrahim laughs. "You correct yourself a lot."

"Language is built for achieving. Hard to talk about being."

They drink tea. Sit with friend. Count breaths. Fifty-three breaths. Fifty-three steps. Numbers are arbitrary. Presence is real.

Maybe that's enough.

###

Antarctica appears on the horizon—white and vast and impossible.

"Mama," Kofi breathes. "It's so big."

"It's the last continent," Zara says. "The last place humans could survive. And barely."

They dock at McMurdo. Disembark carefully. Ground is ice—slippery, dangerous, real.

And there, waiting on the dock: Amara.

Zara sees her sister and everything breaks open.

They run to each other—awkward, crying, laughing. Embrace hard enough to hurt. Eighteen years apart in age. Seven years apart in distance. Now: together.

"I'm sorry," Amara says. "I'm so sorry. I wasted so much time."

"You're here now. That's enough."

"I missed you. I missed everything. I was so scared and I hid and I'm sorry."

"I'm here. We're here. Look—" Zara pulls back, gestures to her family. "Kwame. Maya. Kofi. Your family. Finally."

Amara looks at them—niece and nephew she's never met, brother-in-law she barely knows. Her face crumples with regret and joy.

"Hi," Maya says. "I'm Maya. I'm so glad to meet you."

"I'm Kofi. You have penguins here?"

Amara laughs through tears. "Some. Yes. I'll show you."

Behind Amara: David. Quiet, kind, weathered by work and time. He nods to Zara.

"Thank you for coming," he says. "Amara needed you. We all need each other now."

They walk from the docks through McMurdo. To the house Amara and David share. Small. Warm. Enough.

Inside, they sit together. Six people. Two sisters. Two husbands. Two children.

Family. Finally. Completely.

###

That evening, Elena Torres invites everyone to dinner.

Small gathering. Her, Kenji, Amara and David, Zara and family, Ibrahim—few others. Simple meal. Good conversation.

"Ibrahim," Elena says. "Kenji tells me you attend every religious service in McMurdo."

"Most of them. Trying to understand."

"Have you?"

"Some. I understand why people believe. Why they need to. Why they don't. All of it makes sense. None of it is complete."

"And you? Where do you land?"

Ibrahim considers. "Nowhere. I'm uncertain. Permanently. And I think: that's okay. Uncertainty is honest. Maybe the only honest response to existence."

Zara leans forward. "That's Wei's teaching. She taught us the same thing. Nothing is certain. Everything is temporary. That's truth, not tragedy."

"You knew Professor Wei?" Ibrahim asks.

"She was my neighbor. My children's grandmother. She died three months ago." Zara's voice catches. "She taught us everything that matters."

"I wish I'd met her," Ibrahim says.

"She would have liked you," Kenji says. "Both of you lost what you built your lives on. Both of you finding new way."

They eat together. Talk. Laugh sometimes. Grieve sometimes. Face what's coming together.

Community without doctrine. Connection without certainty. Being without purpose.

###

Late that night, alone in his apartment, Ibrahim writes in his journal:

*Year 12. Three years left.*

*Used to pray. Can't anymore. Tried tonight. Failed. Or succeeded—depending on perspective.*

*The praying was habit. The stopping is truth.*

*Met Zara today. Amara's sister. She came from Lagos with her family. Husband. Two children—fourteen and nine. They'll die at seventeen and twelve. She chose to have them anyway. After detection.*

*That's braver than anything I did in Jerusalem. Fighting for meaning that wasn't there. She chose meaning knowing it's temporary.*

*Wei's teaching, lived.*

*Three years left. I'll spend them uncertain. Present. Witnessing. Being.*

*No paradise. No purpose. No God.*

*Just: this moment. This breath. This life.*

*Wei was right. Kenji's right. Rabbi Cohen's right. Zara's right.*

*Uncertainty is honest.*

*And honesty is enough.*

*For three more years.*

*Then—*

*But present now.*

*Always present now.*

He closes the journal. Sits in silence. Counts fifty-three breaths.

In the house across McMurdo, Zara and Amara sit up late. Sisters finally reunited. Talking about everything. Wei. Lagos. Love. Fear. Children. The end.

"I'm so glad you came," Amara whispers.

"Me too. Me too."

Outside, Antarctica stretches in all directions. Inside, families breathe together.

Two years left.

Two years to be present.

Two years to love fiercely.

Then: together at the end.

Infrastructure collapsing. Systems failing. Certainties gone.

But presence remains.

Love remains.

Connection remains.

That's enough.

Has to be.

They're learning.

All of them.

Together.

Uncertain.

Alive.

Enough.
