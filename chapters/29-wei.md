# Chapter 29: Wei

Mei-Lin Wei wakes to morning light filtering through curtains she no longer has strength to open. Year 11. Four years until the asteroid. 125 years since her birth. Two years—maybe less—until her death.

Individual death. The old kind. Before the collective ending.

She breathes slowly, carefully. Each breath deliberate. Her body is failing in the way bodies fail when they've lived too long—organs tired, bones brittle, muscles atrophied. She's been bedridden for months now. Zara helps her with everything: bathing, dressing, eating, moving from bed to chair.

Wei doesn't mind. She's had 125 years of independence. These final months of dependence feel right somehow. Full circle. Born helpless, dying helpless, living independent between.

The door opens quietly. Zara enters with breakfast—rice porridge, synthesized but warm. Maya and Kofi follow, twelve and eight now, taller each time Wei sees them, growing despite knowing they won't grow old.

"Good morning, Grandmother Wei," Maya says formally. The girl has become serious. Carries weight. Knows too much too soon.

"Good morning, dear heart," Wei says. Her voice is thin, but clear. The mind remains sharp even as the body crumbles. That's biology's cruelty—awareness until the end.

Kofi climbs onto the bed carefully, trying not to jostle her. "Can we read to you today?"

"I would like that very much."

Zara helps Wei sit up—slow process, painful, necessary. Props pillows behind her. Sets the breakfast tray across her lap. Wei eats slowly. Everything is slow now. Eating, breathing, thinking. Time stretches differently when you're dying. Each moment lasting, each moment precious.

"What shall we read?" Maya asks, browsing Wei's bookshelf.

"Something with flowers," Wei says. "I miss the garden."

She can't go to the garden anymore. Can't sit under the lemon tree, can't touch the gardenias, can't feel soil under her fingers. The garden continues without her—Zara maintains it, the flowers bloom, the tree drops fruit. Life continues when you can no longer participate.

This is good practice for what comes next. Letting go. Releasing. Allowing the world to exist without you.

Maya finds a poetry collection. Sits beside the bed. Reads in her clear young voice:

*"The cherry blossoms fall*  
*Even in spring, even in bloom*  
*Knowing their briefness."*

Wei closes her eyes, listening. Poetry is better than philosophy at the end. Truth distilled to beauty. Impermanence made lovely.

"Read another," she whispers.

Maya reads for an hour. Kofi falls asleep against Wei's side—warm small body, alive and temporary, precious beyond measure. Wei touches his hair gently. Won't see him reach nine. Won't see Maya reach fifteen. Will die before them, individually, the old way.

This is mercy and tragedy. She won't watch them die in the asteroid's impact. But they'll lose her first, learn grief first, carry her absence into their brief remaining time.

Both mercy and tragedy. Both true at once.

Afternoon, Zara sits with Wei while the children play outside. Their voices float through the window—laughter, argument, the sounds of living.

"How are you?" Zara asks.

"Dying," Wei says simply. "Not today. But soon."

"Don't—"

"Zara. We've talked about this. I'm 125 years old. My body is finished. I'm ready."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. She's been caring for Wei for two years now—daily visits, hourly help, constant presence. More than neighbor. More than friend. Family by choice.

"I'm not ready," Zara says.

"You don't have to be ready. Death comes whether we're ready or not. I'm ready—I've lived long enough to be ready. You're not, Maya's not, Kofi's not. That's okay. You'll grieve. Then you'll keep living. That's how it works."

"I don't know how to do this."

"Yes you do. You've been doing it since detection. Loving fiercely despite knowing it's brief. Being present despite knowing it's temporary. That's all grief is—love persisting after loss."

Wei reaches for Zara's hand. The gesture takes effort. Her arm barely lifts. But connection matters more than comfort.

"Thank you," Wei says. "For caring for me. For letting your children love me. For being my neighbor. You made my last years beautiful."

"You made mine meaningful," Zara says. "Your wisdom, your teaching, your presence. You showed us how to live with impermanence."

"I showed you what you already knew. You chose to have Kofi after detection. That was wisdom. I just gave words to what you understood."

They sit in silence. Outside, children play. Inside, old woman and younger woman hold hands, bearing witness to ending, to beginning, to the constant cycle of bloom and fade.

"Will you be here?" Wei asks. "At the end?"

"Yes. If you want me."

"I want you. And the children. I want to die with people I love nearby. That's the only blessing of individual death—choosing your witnesses."

"We'll be here."

"Thank you."

---

Weeks pass. Wei drifts more now—lucid moments fewer, sleep longer, the body preparing for final shutdown. She dreams of her husband Chen, dead twenty-three years. Dreams of students she taught over seventy years of philosophy. Dreams of gardens, of flowers blooming and fading, of cycles continuing.

She wakes one morning knowing: soon. Days, maybe. Not weeks.

Zara helps her eat breakfast. Wei manages a few bites. Her appetite is gone. The body knows it doesn't need fuel for much longer.

"Zara," Wei says. "I'm dying soon."

"I know."

"Before the asteroid. Individual death. That still exists. Don't forget that." Wei breathes carefully. "Even with the asteroid, we each die our own death. You'll die with your children, together. I die alone. Neither is better. Both are death. Both are okay."

Zara is crying. Wei lets her. Grief needs expression. Holding it back poisons the spirit.

"You won't be alone," Zara says. "We'll be with you."

"Yes. But I go first. You stay. That's the hard part—staying. But you will. For Maya and Kofi. For Kwame. For yourself. You'll stay until you can't."

"I don't want you to go."

"I know. But I must. Like the flower. Blooming, fading. It's natural. Don't cling to me. Let me go."

"I don't know if I can."

"You can. You will. Because you're brave. Because you understand impermanence better than most. Because you chose life even knowing it's brief." Wei squeezes Zara's hand weakly. "You are my legacy. You and Maya and Kofi. My teaching continues through you."

"I'll teach them what you taught me."

"Good. Tell them: be present. Be kind. Don't cling. Accept what comes. That's all. That's everything."

"I will. I promise."

---

Days later, Wei barely wakes. Drifts in and out. When lucid, she sees Zara nearby. Sees Maya reading quietly. Sees Kofi drawing. Sees life continuing.

She writes no final letter. Said everything needed saying. Taught everything worth teaching. Lived fully, dies ready.

One afternoon, lucid moment, she asks Zara: "Will you tell Kenji?"

"Of course. When it's time."

"Tell him: the flower bloomed. He'll understand."

"I will."

"Tell him: I was proud of him. Proud of his seeking, proud of his stopping, proud of his returning home."

"I'll tell him."

"Tell Elena: she governed with dignity. That's wisdom."

"Yes."

Wei closes her eyes. "Thank you for being my neighbor. Thank you for bringing life to my last years. You are my joy."

"You're mine too."

Wei sleeps. Dreams of Chen, young and laughing. Dreams of students learning, growing, leaving. Dreams of gardenias blooming white and perfect.

Dreams of impermanence made visible.

Dreams of truth.

---

She wakes one final morning knowing: today.

The knowing is clear. Absolute. Today the body stops.

"Zara," she whispers.

Zara is beside her immediately. "I'm here."

"Today. It's today."

Zara's face crumples. Recovers. "What do you need?"

"Children. I want to say goodbye."

Zara brings them—Maya fourteen now (when did that happen?), Kofi eleven, both growing despite knowing they won't grow old. They sit on Wei's bed carefully, trying not to hurt her, not knowing they can't hurt worse than dying already hurts.

"Grandmother," Maya says, voice breaking.

"Sweet girl. I love you. I'm so proud of you. So proud of your questions, your thinking, your being." Wei breathes slowly. "Be present. Even when afraid. Be present. That's all that matters."

"I'll try," Maya whispers.

"You will. You already do."

Kofi is crying silently. Wei touches his face with trembling fingers.

"Little one. Don't cry. Or cry—crying is good. But know: I'm okay. I'm ready. It's my time."

"Don't go," Kofi says. "Please don't go."

"I must. You'll understand when—" Wei stops. Realizes. He won't get older. Won't reach understanding through age. Only through experience. "Be kind. That's all that matters. Be kind to yourself, to others, to your mother and father and sister. Be kind. Can you do that?"

"Yes," Kofi sobs. "I'll be kind."

"Good. That's my brave boy."

Zara sits beside Wei, holding her hand. The children press close. Kwame appears in the doorway—respectful, present, witnessing.

Wei looks at them. Her family by choice. Her legacy. Her joy.

"Thank you," she whispers. "All of you. Thank you for letting me love you. For loving me. For being here."

"We love you, Grandmother," Maya says.

"I know. I feel it. That's everything."

Wei closes her eyes. Not sleeping. Just: resting. Preparing. Letting go.

Her breathing slows. The body knows what to do. Lungs filling less. Heart beating slower. Systems shutting down in proper sequence.

The room is quiet. Zara holds her hand. The children are close. Love surrounds her.

This is good death. Natural death. Ready death.

Wei thinks of Chen. *I'm coming, my love. Wait a little longer.*

Thinks of students. *You learned well. Keep learning.*

Thinks of gardenias. *Bloom and fade. Bloom and fade. Perfect cycle.*

Thinks of impermanence. *I was right. It's not terrible. It's true.*

Her breathing slows further. Gaps between breaths longer. The body releasing, the spirit releasing, everything releasing.

One breath.

Another.

Another, smaller.

Then:

Space.

Stillness.

End.

Mei-Lin Wei dies at 125 years old, naturally, peacefully, surrounded by love, two years before the asteroid ends everything.

Individual death. Before collective death. Reminder that dying is personal, even when it's universal.

She lived fully. She taught constantly. She loved freely. She died ready.

The flower bloomed.

The flower faded.

It was enough.

It was everything.

In the room, Zara weeps. Maya holds Kofi. Kwame stands witness.

Outside, the garden continues. The lemon tree drops fruit. The flowers bloom.

Life continues when you're gone.

That's the lesson.

That's the truth.

That's the mercy and tragedy of it all.

Wei taught until she couldn't.

Now her students carry forward.

Teaching what she taught them:

Be present.

Be kind.

Don't cling.

Accept what comes.

Bloom while you can.

Fade when you must.

It's enough.

It's everything.

Always was.

Always will be.

Until it isn't.

And then—then it continues anyway, just without you.

That's okay.

That's natural.

That's the truth the gardenia teaches.

Wei knew it.

Now Zara knows it.

Now Maya and Kofi learn it.

Now they carry it forward.

For three more years.

Until they can't.

And then—someone else. Somewhere else. Or no one.

But the truth remains:

Impermanence.

Beauty.

Love.

Enough.

Wei's body lies still.

Her teaching continues.

Her love remains.

That's legacy.

That's enough.

The flower bloomed.

Perfect.

Brief.

True.
