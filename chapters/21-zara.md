# Chapter 21: Zara

Maya stands in the kitchen doorway, nine years old and serious. "Mama, why did you have Kofi if you knew the world was ending?"

Zara's hands pause over the cutting board. The knife hovers above the yam. Outside, Kofi is building something in the compound—six years old, his laughter floating through the open window. Lagos breathes around them: three million people still living, still cooking dinner, still asking hard questions.

"Come here," Zara says.

Maya crosses the kitchen, climbs onto the stool beside her mother. She's getting tall—will be taller than Zara by the time she's twelve. By the time she's fourteen. Won't be tall for long after that.

Zara sets down the knife, turns to face her daughter fully. "Why are you asking this?"

"Adara's mom said it at school. She said you were selfish. That having a baby after detection was cruel." Maya's voice is steady, but her eyes search Zara's face for confirmation or denial. "Was it cruel?"

Zara's chest tightens. She knew this conversation would come eventually. Knew it would hurt.

"No," she says firmly. "It wasn't cruel. It was love."

"How?"

"You want the real answer? Or the easy one?"

Maya considers. "The real one."

Zara pulls her daughter close, arms around her thin shoulders. "I had Kofi because I love you both. Because life is beautiful even when it's short. Because every moment with you matters—every laugh, every question, every time you build something or draw something or just exist in the world. You and Kofi... you make everything matter."

"But we're going to die."

"Yes."

"Soon."

"Yes."

"Doesn't that make it sad?"

"It makes it precious." Zara holds her tighter. "Maya, listen. Everyone always died. Before the asteroid, before Forever Earth, always. Life was always temporary. We just pretended it wasn't. Now we can't pretend. So we have to really see it—really feel it. And when I see you and Kofi, I feel... everything. Love and grief and joy and fear all at once. That's not cruel. That's being alive."

Maya is quiet against her shoulder. Then: "I'm glad you had him."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Kofi's annoying sometimes, but I love him. I like being a big sister."

Zara closes her eyes, breathing in her daughter's hair—sweet from shampoo, faintly dusty from playing. Eight years left. Eight years for Maya to be a big sister, to ask hard questions, to exist in the world.

Eight years for Kofi to laugh in the compound, to build impossible things, to be six and then seven and then—

She pushes the thought away. Holds her daughter. Exists in this moment.

"Come on," she says finally. "Help me finish dinner. Then we'll bring some to Professor Wei."

Maya slides off the stool, picks up a yam. "Is Professor Wei going to die soon?"

"Yes. Much sooner than us."

"Is she scared?"

"No. I don't think so. She's ready."

"I don't think I'll ever be ready," Maya says quietly.

"Me neither, baby. Me neither."

They cook together—mother and daughter, nine years old and thirty-three, both alive, both dying, both here. The yam sizzles in the pan. The rice steams. Outside, Kofi shouts something triumphant—his structure must have succeeded.

Zara calls through the window: "Kofi! Wash your hands! Dinner soon!"

"Five more minutes!"

"Now!"

"Okay, okay!"

The familiar rhythm. The blessed routine. Dinner and homework and bedtime stories and morning wake-ups and breakfast and school and work and play and cooking and cleaning and living, living, living until they can't anymore.

After dinner, they walk next door to Professor Wei's compound. Zara carries the food, Maya carries flowers from their garden, Kofi runs ahead. Wei's house is small—a single-story structure with the garden out front where she teaches sometimes. Fifteen years Zara has known her. Fifteen years of quiet wisdom, gentle presence, calm center in the chaos.

Wei is getting frailer. 119 years old. Her body preparing for the end even as the world does the same.

Kenji opens the door—Elena's son, the seeker who's been staying with Wei for months now. He looks different than when he arrived. Quieter. Less frantic.

"Zara, Maya, Kofi—come in. She's in the garden."

They find Wei sitting under the lemon tree, eyes closed, breathing slowly. Not asleep—meditating, maybe, or just resting. Her face is deeply lined, beautiful, serene.

"Professor," Zara says softly.

Wei opens her eyes, smiles. "Zara. Children. You brought food?"

"Yam stew. Your favorite."

"You spoil me."

"You earned it."

They sit in the garden—all five of them, eating stew, talking quietly. The evening settles warm around them. Lagos hums its constant hum. Somewhere, music plays. Somewhere, people laugh. Somewhere, life continues because what else would it do?

Maya sits beside Wei, telling her about school—about the lesson on water engineering (Zara's field, passed down), about the boy who tried to kiss her at recess (she punched him), about the question she asked her mother.

"I asked why she had Kofi if the world was ending," Maya says.

Wei nods, unsurprised. "What did she say?"

"That life is beautiful even when it's short."

"Do you believe her?"

Maya thinks. "I think so. I mean... I'm alive. That's good, right? Even if I won't be alive forever?"

"That's very wise," Wei says.

"Mama says you're going to die soon. Before the asteroid."

Zara winces. "Maya—"

But Wei just smiles. "Yes. I am. Very soon, I think."

"Are you scared?"

"No. I lived 119 years. That's more than most people get. I'm tired now. Ready to rest."

"But won't you miss things?" Maya asks. "Miss people?"

Wei reaches out, touches Maya's face gently. "I'll miss you. And Kofi. And your mama. And many others. But missing is the price of loving. I wouldn't trade the love to avoid the missing."

Kofi, who's been building something with sticks at the edge of the garden, looks up. "I don't understand."

"You will," Wei says. "Someday. When you love someone so much that even losing them is worth it."

"I love Mama and Papa and Maya that much," Kofi says seriously.

"I know you do."

They stay until dark. Kenji walks them home—polite, helpful, changed by whatever Wei taught him. At their gate, he pauses.

"Thank you," he says to Zara. "For letting me be your neighbor. For sharing your family. It helps."

"You're helping her," Zara says. "That helps me."

"She's teaching me to stop running."

"Good. We could use you around. Elena would like you nearby when—" She doesn't finish. Doesn't need to.

Kenji nods. "I'm going back to Antarctica soon. To see my mother. Before there's no time left."

"That's good. That's right." Zara touches his arm. "Tell her I think she's amazing. What she's done for Lagos... for everyone. Tell her we're grateful."

"I will."

He leaves. Zara gets the children ready for bed—teeth brushing, pajamas, the blessed routine. They share a room now. Used to have separate rooms, but after detection, Maya asked to move in with Kofi. "I don't want to be alone," she said. Zara and Kwame moved the beds together, let them fall asleep side by side.

Tonight, Zara reads them a story—an old Nigerian folktale about Anansi the spider. Maya knows it by heart, corrects her when she misremembers a word. Kofi falls asleep halfway through, his small body curled toward his sister.

Maya stays awake. "Mama?"

"Yes, baby?"

"When we die... will it hurt?"

Zara's breath catches. She could lie. Should probably lie. But she promised herself: honesty. Always honesty with her children.

"I don't know. Maybe. But we'll be together. All of us. Papa and me and you and Kofi. We'll hold each other. It won't be alone."

"Okay." Maya closes her eyes. "I love you, Mama."

"I love you too. So much."

"I'm glad you had us. Even though we're dying. I'm glad we got to be alive."

Zara's vision blurs. She kisses her daughter's forehead, then Kofi's. Sits there in the doorway watching them breathe—nine and six, alive, temporary, precious beyond measure.

Kwame finds her there twenty minutes later. He slides down beside her, takes her hand.

"You okay?" he whispers.

"Maya asked why I had Kofi."

"What did you say?"

"That life is beautiful even when it's short."

"It is," Kwame says. "Isn't it?"

"Yes." Zara leans against him. "But it's also unbearable sometimes."

"I know."

They sit together, watching their children sleep. Outside, Lagos breathes. Inside, this small room holds everything that matters—two children who will never grow old, two parents who will watch them die, love so fierce it hurts to feel it.

"Kenji's leaving soon," Zara says. "Going back to his mother."

"Good. Family should be together now."

"Yeah." She squeezes his hand. "Kwame?"

"Mm?"

"I wouldn't change it. Even knowing... even with everything... I wouldn't change having them."

"Neither would I."

They stay there until midnight, then move to their own bed. Kwame falls asleep quickly—exhausted, always exhausted. He's been working double shifts at the solar plant, keeping systems running though half the city's left, though the infrastructure's failing, though it doesn't matter. He works because he works. Because it's what he knows.

Zara lies awake, listening to him breathe. In the next room, her children breathe. In the compound next door, Wei breathes shallow and slow, preparing for the end. In Antarctica, her sister Amara breathes, maybe awake too, maybe thinking about waste and loss and the years they could have had.

Five years since detection. Eight years left.

Maya will be seventeen. Kofi thirteen.

Not enough time. Never enough time.

But the time they have—precious. Beautiful. Worth it.

Worth everything.

Zara finally sleeps near dawn. Dreams of the asteroid—of fire and impact and ending. But in the dream, she's holding her children. Kwame holds them all. They're together.

That's all that matters.

All that ever mattered.

---

The next morning, Zara takes the children to work with her—the water treatment facility on the edge of the city. It's barely operational now, half the staff gone, systems degrading. But water still needs treating. People still need drinking.

Maya wants to learn everything. She follows Zara through the facility, asking questions, taking notes in her small notebook. "How does reverse osmosis work? Why does pH matter? What's the filtration sequence?"

Zara teaches her. Patiently. Thoroughly. Knowing Maya will never use this knowledge professionally, will never be an engineer, will never have career or future or anything beyond eight years.

But teaching her anyway. Because knowledge matters. Because Maya's curiosity matters. Because these hours together, mother teaching daughter, matter more than anything.

Kofi gets bored with technical explanations. He plays in the courtyard—building dams in puddles, constructing elaborate systems with sticks and stones. Inventing, creating, being six years old with eight years left.

At lunch, they eat together on the facility steps. Zara's coworker Adebayo joins them—he's stayed in Lagos, kept working, has three children of his own.

"Maya, Kofi—you getting tall," he says, smiling.

"I'm going to be taller than Mama," Maya says proudly.

"I see that. You'll be beautiful."

"I'm already beautiful," Maya says matter-of-factly.

Adebayo laughs. "Yes, you are. Absolutely right."

They eat in comfortable silence. Then Adebayo asks Zara: "You heard about the Antarctic invitation?"

"What invitation?"

"Mayor Torres—she's inviting families to visit Year 15. Final gathering. Wants communities to see each other before end."

Zara's chest tightens. "Amara's there. My sister."

"Then you should go. Let children see the megacity. Let them see everything before—" He doesn't finish.

"You think we could? The transport systems—"

"Barely functional, but yeah. If you plan now, should work. Year 15, few months before impact."

Zara looks at her children. Maya listening intently. Kofi building something with his lunch scraps—architecture from bread and fruit.

"Would you want that?" she asks them. "To see Antarctica? To meet Aunt Amara?"

"The scientist aunt?" Maya asks. "The one who found the asteroid?"

"She didn't find it. She confirmed it. But yes."

"I want to meet her," Maya says. "I want to see everything. All the places. Before—"

She doesn't finish either.

None of them do.

But they understand.

That afternoon, Zara calls Amara. They haven't spoken in months—both busy, both exhausted, both barely coping. The video call connects after three tries. Amara's face appears—gaunt, tired, older than her fifty-one years.

"Zara."

"Amara. Hi."

They stare at each other. Sisters. Eighteen years apart. Used to be close. Then detection happened, and Amara withdrew into work, and Zara withdrew into family, and the distance grew.

"I heard about the Year 15 invitation," Zara says. "I want to come. Bring Kwame and the children. I want you to meet them properly. Before—"

"Yes," Amara says immediately. "Yes. Please come. I want... I've wasted so much time, Zara. I want to see you. I want to meet Maya and Kofi. I want us to be together."

"Okay." Zara smiles through tears. "Okay. We'll come. Year 15."

"Year 15," Amara echoes. "I'll be there. I promise."

"I love you, sister."

"I love you too."

They disconnect. Zara sits in her small office at the water facility, crying quietly. Outside, Maya and Kofi play in the courtyard. Inside, Zara grieves and loves and plans and exists.

Eight years.

Time enough for a final gathering.

Time enough to be sisters again.

Time enough to show her children the marvel that humans built.

Time enough.

It has to be.

---

A week later, Wei dies.

Zara finds her in the garden, under the lemon tree, eyes closed, peaceful. Just: stopped breathing. 119 years, and then rest.

Maya and Kofi cry—first death they've experienced. First loss. Zara holds them, explains what she can.

"She was ready," Zara says. "She lived a long, full life. She was tired. Now she's resting."

"Will we rest too?" Kofi asks. "After the asteroid?"

"I think so. Yes."

"Will it be peaceful like Professor Wei?"

"I hope so, baby. I hope so."

They help prepare the body—ritual washing, dressing in white, burial in the garden under the lemon tree. Small ceremony. Twenty neighbors. Kenji speaks—halting, emotional, grateful. Thanks Wei for teaching him to stop running.

Maya asks to speak too. Stands small and serious beside the grave.

"Professor Wei taught me that missing is the price of loving," she says. "I miss her. So I know I loved her. Thank you, Professor Wei. For letting me love you."

Everyone cries.

They bury her as the sun sets. Plant flowers over the grave. Kenji stays for three more days, then leaves for Antarctica—going home to his mother, putting Wei's teachings into practice.

After he leaves, the compound next door sits empty. Zara and the children tend Wei's garden—watering, weeding, keeping it alive. It feels important. Like maintaining something beautiful even though it's temporary.

Like everything now.

Like all of it.

Beautiful and temporary and worth tending anyway.

That night, tucking the children in, Maya says: "Mama, when we go to Antarctica, can we tell Aunt Amara about Professor Wei?"

"Of course."

"Good. I want her to know. I want everyone to know. Professor Wei mattered."

"She did, baby. She absolutely did."

"We all matter," Maya says. "Don't we? Even though we're temporary?"

"Yes." Zara kisses her forehead. "We all matter. You matter so much."

"I know," Maya says simply. "I feel it."

Zara leaves them sleeping. Returns to Kwame in their bed. Holds him close.

"Eight years," she whispers.

"Eight years," he echoes.

"Think that's enough time?"

"For what?"

"For them to know they were loved. For them to be happy. For all of this to be worth it."

Kwame pulls her closer. "It's already worth it. It was always worth it."

"Yeah," Zara says. "Yeah, it was."

Outside, Lagos breathes. Wei's garden grows in the dark. Two children sleep in the next room, alive, temporary, precious beyond measure.

Eight years to love them.

Eight years to show them the world.

Eight years to be family.

Not enough.

But everything.

Always everything.

Zara closes her eyes. Dreams of Antarctica. Of sisters reunited. Of children meeting their aunt. Of the gathering before the end.

Of making every moment matter.

Because they all do.

Every one.

Until they don't.

And even then—even after—the love remains.

Has to.

It's all there is.

All there ever was.

All that matters.
