# Chapter 11 - Students

The gardenia blooms in Wei's garden, white petals perfect against the morning light. Professor Wei kneels beside it—slowly, carefully, one hand bracing against the earth. She's 119 years old. Everything takes time now.

Kenji Torres watches from the doorway, holding her tea. He's been in Lagos for eight months, living in the small guest room of her home, learning what she calls "nothing at all."

"Kenji," she says without looking up. "Come see."

He crosses the garden, bare feet on warm dirt. Lagos stretches around them—three million people still, down from five but still vibrant, still alive. Life continuing because what else would it do?

He kneels beside her, offers the tea. She takes it with both hands, nodding thanks.

"You see this flower?" Wei asks.

Kenji looks. The gardenia is beautiful—flawless white petals, sweet fragrance, perfect structure. "I see it."

"It bloomed yesterday," Wei says. "By tomorrow, the petals will brown. Three days, it will fall. Two weeks, nothing left but memory."

She sips her tea, gazing at the flower like it contains all wisdom.

"I've seen this same plant bloom for fifteen years," she continues. "Every year, same cycle. Buds appear. Flowers open. Beauty happens. Then: gone. Every year, I think maybe this time it will last. But no. Impermanence is the only constant."

Kenji has heard variations of this lesson for months. Impermanence. Non-clinging. The illusion of permanence. Wei teaches Buddhism as philosophy, not religion—she doesn't ask him to believe in reincarnation or enlightenment. Just: observe truth.

Truth: everything ends.

"The asteroid doesn't change this," Wei says quietly. "Asteroid or not, the flower was always temporary. Your life was always temporary. My life—" she smiles, "—very temporary now. The asteroid just makes it visible."

"That's supposed to be comforting?" Kenji asks.

"Is it not?"

###

Maya stands in the kitchen doorway, nine years old and serious. "Mama, why did you have Kofi if you knew the world was ending?"

Zara's hands pause over the cutting board. The knife hovers above the yam. Outside, Kofi is building something in the compound—six years old, his laughter floating through the open window.

"Come here," Zara says.

Maya crosses the kitchen, climbs onto the stool beside her mother. She's getting tall—will be taller than Zara by the time she's twelve. By the time she's fourteen.

Won't be tall for long after that.

Zara sets down the knife, turns to face her daughter fully. "Why are you asking this?"

"Adara's mom said it at school. She said you were selfish. That having a baby after detection was cruel." Maya's voice is steady, but her eyes search Zara's face. "Was it cruel?"

Zara's chest tightens. She knew this conversation would come eventually.

"No," she says firmly. "It wasn't cruel. It was love."

"How?"

"You want the real answer? Or the easy one?"

Maya considers. "The real one."

Zara pulls her daughter close. "I had Kofi because I love you both. Because life is beautiful even when it's short. Because every moment with you matters—every laugh, every question, every time you build something or draw something or just exist in the world. You and Kofi... you make everything matter."

"But we're going to die."

"Yes."

"Soon."

"Yes."

"Doesn't that make it sad?"

"It makes it precious." Zara holds her tighter. "Maya, listen. Everyone always died. Before the asteroid, always. Life was always temporary. We just pretended it wasn't. Now we can't pretend. So we have to really see it—really feel it. And when I see you and Kofi, I feel... everything. Love and grief and joy and fear all at once. That's not cruel. That's being alive."

Maya is quiet against her shoulder. Then: "I'm glad you had him."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah. Kofi's annoying sometimes, but I love him. I like being a big sister."

###

Kenji doesn't know how to answer Wei's question. For eight months, he's sat in this garden, listened to Wei's gentle teachings, tried to understand what she sees that he can't. She's calm—not resigned, not despairing, just... clear.

He's thirty-four years old. He traveled the world seeking meaning—Tokyo's pleasure districts, Buddhist temples, Hindu ashrams, Jerusalem's contested streets. He met Ibrahim there, another seeker. They talked for days about belief and doubt. Then Ibrahim left to find his own way, and Kenji came here, to Wei, because she was the only person who admitted she had no answers.

"I don't understand how you're not terrified," Kenji says.

Wei sets down her tea, reaches out with a gnarled hand to touch the gardenia petals. So gentle. Like blessing it.

"I am old," she says. "I would die soon anyway—five years, ten, fifteen at most. The asteroid just... clarifies. Takes away the maybe. I was going to lose this garden, these flowers, this body. The asteroid doesn't steal anything I wasn't going to lose."

"But everyone else—"

"Everyone else was also temporary. You knew this, Kenji. You've always known. Your mind understood impermanence since you were child. But—" she taps his chest lightly, "—here, you never accepted. You thought if you searched hard enough, if you understood enough, if you *tried* enough, you could find something permanent. Something that lasts."

Her eyes, ancient and kind, hold his.

"But nothing lasts. Nothing was ever going to last. The asteroid is just... honest."

Something breaks in Kenji's chest. Not painful—just: breaking. Like ice cracking, like dams releasing, like breath held too long finally exhaled.

He starts crying.

Wei doesn't move, doesn't comfort. She just sits beside him, hand on the gardenia, letting him break.

He cries for ten minutes. For the years spent searching. For the hedonism that felt hollow. For the temples where he couldn't force faith. For Ibrahim's desperate certainty crumbling. For his mother Elena governing a city that's dying.

For the gardenia that's already dying.

When the crying stops, he feels... not better. Not worse. Just: emptied.

"Sorry," he whispers.

"For what?"

"For... breaking down."

"Kenji." Wei smiles. "That wasn't breaking down. That was breaking open. Very different."

###

Zara closes her eyes, breathing in her daughter's hair—sweet from shampoo, faintly dusty from playing. Eight years left. Eight years for Maya to be a big sister, to ask hard questions, to exist in the world.

Eight years for Kofi to laugh in the compound, to build impossible things, to be six and then seven and then—

She pushes the thought away. Holds her daughter. Exists in this moment.

"Come on," she says finally. "Help me finish dinner. Then we'll bring some to Professor Wei."

Maya slides off the stool, picks up a yam. "Is Professor Wei going to die soon?"

"Yes. Much sooner than us."

"Is she scared?"

"No. I don't think so. She's ready."

"I don't think I'll ever be ready," Maya says quietly.

"Me neither, baby. Me neither."

They cook together—mother and daughter, nine years old and thirty-three, both alive, both dying, both here. The yam sizzles in the pan. The rice steams. Outside, Kofi shouts something triumphant—his structure must have succeeded.

Zara calls through the window: "Kofi! Wash your hands! Dinner soon!"

"Five more minutes!"

"Now!"

"Okay, okay!"

The familiar rhythm. The blessed routine. Living, living, living until they can't anymore.

###

They cook together in Wei's small kitchen. Wei moving carefully, Kenji chopping vegetables, both of them silent in comfortable rhythm. Through the window, he sees Zara's compound next door—Zara, his mother's friend, who chose to have a second child after detection. Her daughter Maya is nine now, her son Kofi six.

"You met Zara's children?" Wei asks, reading his gaze.

"A few times. Maya asked me why I travel so much."

"What did you tell her?"

"That I was looking for something."

"Did she ask if you found it?"

Kenji pauses, knife hovering over the cutting board. "She asked what I was looking for."

"And?"

"I didn't know how to answer."

Wei hums, stirring soup. "Maybe because you don't know. Maybe you're not looking *for* something. Maybe you're looking *from* something."

He sets down the knife. "From what?"

"Impermanence. Uncertainty. The truth that nothing lasts and you can't control anything and there's no permanent meaning you can extract and hold forever." She tastes the soup, adds salt. "You're not seeking truth, Kenji. You're fleeing it."

The words land like stones. Heavy, undeniable.

"But I came here," he says. "To learn from you."

"Yes. Because I'm very old and dying soon and you thought maybe I'd give you answer before I go." Wei smiles, gentle, not mocking. "But I have no answer. Just: be here. Be present. Stop seeking what cannot be found. The flower blooms, the flower dies, and between—beauty. That's all. That's everything."

###

After dinner, they walk next door to Professor Wei's compound. Zara carries the food, Maya carries flowers from their garden, Kofi runs ahead.

Kenji opens the door—he looks different than when he arrived. Quieter. Less frantic.

"Zara, Maya, Kofi—come in. She's in the garden."

They find Wei sitting under the lemon tree, eyes closed, breathing slowly. Not asleep—meditating, maybe, or just resting. Her face is deeply lined, beautiful, serene.

"Professor," Zara says softly.

Wei opens her eyes, smiles. "Zara. Children. You brought food?"

"Yam stew. Your favorite."

"You spoil me."

"You earned it."

They sit in the garden—all five of them, eating stew, talking quietly. The evening settles warm around them. Lagos hums its constant hum.

Maya sits beside Wei, telling her about school—about the lesson on water engineering (Zara's field, passed down), about the boy who tried to kiss her at recess (she punched him), about the question she asked her mother.

"I asked why she had Kofi if the world was ending," Maya says.

Wei nods, unsurprised. "What did she say?"

"That life is beautiful even when it's short."

"Do you believe her?"

Maya thinks. "I think so. I mean... I'm alive. That's good, right? Even if I won't be alive forever?"

"That's very wise," Wei says.

"Mama says you're going to die soon. Before the asteroid."

Zara winces. "Maya—"

But Wei just smiles. "Yes. I am. Very soon, I think."

"Are you scared?"

"No. I lived 119 years. That's more than most people get. I'm tired now. Ready to rest."

"But won't you miss things?" Maya asks. "Miss people?"

Wei reaches out, touches Maya's face gently. "I'll miss you. And Kofi. And your mama. And many others. But missing is the price of loving. I wouldn't trade the love to avoid the missing."

Kofi, who's been building something with sticks at the edge of the garden, looks up. "I don't understand."

"You will," Wei says. "Someday. When you love someone so much that even losing them is worth it."

"I love Mama and Papa and Maya that much," Kofi says seriously.

"I know you do."

###

They stay until dark. Kenji walks them home—polite, helpful, changed by whatever Wei taught him. At their gate, he pauses.

"Thank you," he says to Zara. "For letting me be your neighbor. For sharing your family. It helps."

"You're helping her," Zara says. "That helps me."

"She's teaching me to stop running."

"Good. We could use you around. Elena would like you nearby when—" She doesn't finish.

Kenji nods. "I'm going back to Antarctica soon. To see my mother. Before there's no time left."

"That's good. That's right." Zara touches his arm. "Tell her I think she's amazing. What she's done... for everyone. Tell her we're grateful."

"I will."

###

That night, Wei teaches Kenji meditation. Not religious—just: sitting, breathing, observing. They sit in her garden, the gardenia already browning, the evening settling warm around them.

"Don't try to empty mind," Wei says. "Mind fills. That's what it does. Just: watch. Watch thoughts come, watch thoughts go. Don't cling, don't push away. Just: observe."

Kenji tries. His mind churns—thoughts of his mother, of Amara, of David, of Ibrahim, of Zara raising children who won't grow up, of the gardenia dying, of Wei dying, of himself dying, of everyone dying, of—

"Kenji," Wei says softly. "You're trying too hard. Just breathe."

He breathes.

The thoughts keep coming. But slowly, something shifts. Not the thoughts stopping—just: space appearing between them. Little gaps. Moments of just breathing, just being, just sitting in a garden while the world ends slowly around him.

It's not peace. Not enlightenment. Not answer.

But it's... something. A beginning.

###

Zara gets the children ready for bed—teeth brushing, pajamas, the blessed routine. They share a room now. Used to have separate rooms, but after detection, Maya asked to move in with Kofi. "I don't want to be alone," she said.

Tonight, Zara reads them a story—an old Nigerian folktale about Anansi the spider. Maya knows it by heart, corrects her when she misremembers a word. Kofi falls asleep halfway through.

Maya stays awake. "Mama?"

"Yes, baby?"

"When we die... will it hurt?"

Zara's breath catches. She could lie. Should probably lie. But she promised herself: honesty. Always honesty with her children.

"I don't know. Maybe. But we'll be together. All of us. Papa and me and you and Kofi. We'll hold each other. It won't be alone."

"Okay." Maya closes her eyes. "I love you, Mama."

"I love you too. So much."

"I'm glad you had us. Even though we're dying. I'm glad we got to be alive."

Zara's vision blurs. She kisses her daughter's forehead, then Kofi's. Sits there in the doorway watching them breathe—nine and six, alive, temporary, precious beyond measure.

###

Kenji helps Wei inside, helps her to bed. She falls asleep quickly, breathing shallow but steady. He sits in her kitchen, drinking tea, watching the dark garden through the window.

He thinks about Maya's question: *What are you looking for?*

He thinks about Wei's answer: *Stop seeking what cannot be found.*

He thinks about the gardenia, blooming and dying, beautiful and temporary, meaning nothing and everything.

And for the first time in years—maybe ever—Kenji thinks: *I could go home.*

Not running. Not seeking. Just: being with his mother for the years that remain. Being present instead of fleeing.

The thought terrifies him.

But it also... settles something. A weight he didn't know he was carrying, finally set down.

###

The next morning, Wei finds him in the garden. The gardenia has dropped half its petals. Two days, it'll be gone.

"You're leaving," she says. Not question. Observation.

"How did you know?"

"Your face is different. Quieter. You decided something."

Kenji nods. "I think... I think I need to go home. See my mother. Stop running."

Wei smiles—deep, genuine, proud. "Good."

"I'll stay until—"

"No." She shakes her head. "Don't wait for me to die. That's clinging. I'll die when I die. You: live while you live. Go. Be with your mother. Be present."

"But what if—"

"Kenji." She takes his hands, her grip surprisingly strong. "You came here seeking answer. I gave you none. But you learned anyway. You learned the only thing: be here. Be now. Stop seeking permanence. Just: be." She squeezes his hands. "Now go be with your mother."

###

That afternoon, Zara takes the children to work with her—the water treatment facility on the edge of the city. It's barely operational now, half the staff gone. But water still needs treating. People still need drinking.

Maya wants to learn everything. She follows Zara through the facility, asking questions, taking notes in her small notebook. "How does reverse osmosis work? Why does pH matter? What's the filtration sequence?"

Zara teaches her. Patiently. Thoroughly. Knowing Maya will never use this knowledge professionally, will never be an engineer, will never have career or future.

But teaching her anyway. Because knowledge matters. Because Maya's curiosity matters. Because these hours together, mother teaching daughter, matter more than anything.

Kofi gets bored with technical explanations. He plays in the courtyard—building dams in puddles, constructing elaborate systems with sticks and stones. Inventing, creating, being six years old with eight years left.

At lunch, they eat together on the facility steps. Zara's coworker Adebayo joins them.

"You heard about the Antarctic invitation?" he asks.

"What invitation?"

"Mayor Torres—she's inviting families to visit Year 15. Final gathering. Wants communities to see each other before end."

Zara's chest tightens. "Amara's there. My sister."

"Then you should go. Let children see the megacity. Let them see everything before—" He doesn't finish.

Zara looks at her children. Maya listening intently. Kofi building something with his lunch scraps.

"Would you want that?" she asks them. "To see Antarctica? To meet Aunt Amara?"

"The scientist aunt?" Maya asks. "The one who confirmed the asteroid?"

"Yes."

"I want to meet her," Maya says. "I want to see everything. All the places. Before—"

She doesn't finish either.

None of them do.

But they understand.

###

Kenji leaves two days later. Zara and the children come to say goodbye. Maya gives him a drawing—a bird-tree sculpture, rendered in crayon. "So you remember us," she says.

"I could never forget you," Kenji says.

Kofi asks, "Did you find what you were looking for?"

Kenji crouches down, meeting the six-year-old's eyes. "No. But I learned to stop looking. That's better, I think."

"That doesn't make sense," Kofi says.

"I know. But it's true anyway."

Wei walks him to the transit station—slowly, leaning on his arm. At the departure platform, she hugs him. Brief, tight, final.

"Thank you," Kenji says. "For teaching me nothing."

"You're welcome. For learning everything." She releases him, steps back. "Kenji. When I die—"

"Don't—"

"Listen. When I die, don't grieve too long. Just remember: the flower bloomed. That's enough. It was always enough."

He gets on the transport before he starts crying. Through the window, he watches Wei standing on the platform, one hand raised in farewell, her small frame solid and temporary, teaching to the end.

###

That afternoon, Zara calls Amara. They haven't spoken in months—both busy, both exhausted, both barely coping. The video call connects after three tries. Amara's face appears—gaunt, tired, older than her fifty-one years.

"Zara."

"Amara. Hi."

They stare at each other. Sisters. Eighteen years apart. Used to be close. Then detection happened, and Amara withdrew into work, and Zara withdrew into family, and the distance grew.

"I heard about the Year 15 invitation," Zara says. "I want to come. Bring Kwame and the children. I want you to meet them properly. Before—"

"Yes," Amara says immediately. "Yes. Please come. I want... I've wasted so much time, Zara. I want to see you. I want to meet Maya and Kofi. I want us to be together."

"Okay." Zara smiles through tears. "Okay. We'll come. Year 15."

"Year 15," Amara echoes. "I'll be there. I promise."

"I love you, sister."

"I love you too."

###

The transport pulls away. Lagos shrinks behind Kenji. Ahead: Antarctica, his mother, his home, his life waiting to be lived instead of fled.

He doesn't have answers. Doesn't have certainty. Doesn't have permanence or meaning or faith or enlightenment.

But he has eight years. Maybe more. Maybe less.

What matters: being present for them. Being with people he loves. Stopping the seeking, starting the being.

The gardenia is dying. The world is dying. He is dying.

But for now, he's alive.

And maybe—maybe—that's enough.

It has to be.

It always was.

He just needed to stop running long enough to see it.

###

A week later, Wei dies.

Zara finds her in the garden, under the lemon tree, eyes closed, peaceful. Just: stopped breathing. 119 years, and then rest.

Maya and Kofi cry—first death they've experienced. First loss. Zara holds them, explains what she can.

"She was ready," Zara says. "She lived a long, full life. She was tired. Now she's resting."

"Will we rest too?" Kofi asks. "After the asteroid?"

"I think so. Yes."

"Will it be peaceful like Professor Wei?"

"I hope so, baby. I hope so."

They help prepare the body—ritual washing, dressing in white, burial in the garden under the lemon tree. Small ceremony. Twenty neighbors.

Maya asks to speak. Stands small and serious beside the grave.

"Professor Wei taught me that missing is the price of loving," she says. "I miss her. So I know I loved her. Thank you, Professor Wei. For letting me love you."

Everyone cries.

They bury her as the sun sets. Plant flowers over the grave.

After the ceremony, Zara and the children tend Wei's garden—watering, weeding, keeping it alive. It feels important. Like maintaining something beautiful even though it's temporary.

Like everything now.

Like all of it.

Beautiful and temporary and worth tending anyway.

###

That night, tucking the children in, Maya says: "Mama, when we go to Antarctica, can we tell Aunt Amara about Professor Wei?"

"Of course."

"And show her the drawing Kofi made?"

"Absolutely."

"Good." Maya settles into bed, curling toward her brother. "I want her to know. About Professor Wei. About us. About everything."

"She will, baby. I promise."

Zara kisses them both. Watches them breathe—nine and six, alive, temporary, precious.

Eight years left.

Time enough for a final gathering.

Time enough to be sisters again.

Time enough to show her children the world humans built.

Time enough to love them completely.

Time enough.

It has to be.

Zara closes the door quietly. Kwame finds her in the hallway, takes her hand.

"You okay?" he whispers.

"Maya asked why I had Kofi."

"What did you say?"

"That life is beautiful even when it's short."

"It is," Kwame says. "Isn't it?"

"Yes." Zara leans against him. "But it's also unbearable sometimes."

"I know."

They stand together in the dark hallway. Outside, Lagos breathes. Inside, their children breathe. In the compound next door, Wei's garden grows over her grave.

Everything temporary.

Everything precious.

Everything worth it.

"I wouldn't change it," Zara says. "Even knowing... even with everything... I wouldn't change having them."

"Neither would I."

Eight years left.

Then seven years, eleven months.

Then seven years, ten months.

The countdown continues.

They continue with it.

Not running. Not hiding. Not seeking.

Just: being.

Together.

Alive.

For as long as they have.

The flower blooms, the flower dies, and between—beauty.

That's all.

That's everything.
