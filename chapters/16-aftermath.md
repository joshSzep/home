# Chapter 16 - Aftermath

The call comes at dawn.

Kenji is meditating in his small Antarctica apartment when his comm unit buzzes—insistent, urgent. He considers ignoring it. Wei taught him about non-attachment. But attachment and presence are different things.

He answers.

Zara's face appears on the screen. She's been crying.

"Kenji. Professor Wei died yesterday. Peacefully, in her garden. She was ready."

The words land like stones. Wei. Dead. Gone.

Year 12. Three years until the asteroid. Hours since his teacher's death.

"No," he says. Not denial. Just: response to grief.

"I'm sorry," Zara says. "She went peacefully. The children were with her. She said to tell you: the flower bloomed. She said you'd understand."

Kenji does understand. The gardenia in Wei's garden. Blooming and dying. Meaning not in lasting but in being. Wei lived 125 years. Taught for seventy. Loved freely. Died ready.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.

But it doesn't feel like enough. Not yet. Not when grief is fresh and raw and impossible.

"Tell Maya and Kofi I'm honoring her from here," Kenji says. "I can't come for the funeral, but I'm honoring her."

"I will. She loved you, Kenji. She was so proud of you."

"I loved her too."

The call ends. Kenji sits in the morning light, Antarctica stretching cold and beautiful outside his window, and feels the first person he ever truly loved disappear from the world.

Individual death. Before the collective death. Wei escaped the asteroid by dying naturally.

She would call that mercy.

Kenji calls it loss.

Both are true.

###

In Lagos, Wei's body is still warm when Zara realizes everything has changed.

The children sit beside the grave—Maya thirteen, Kofi nine, both crying quietly, both staring at the fresh earth where their grandmother's ashes rest. Kwame stands close, present but giving them space, letting them grieve.

Zara's hands shake. Wei's letter is folded in her pocket—written months ago, found yesterday, words about living fully for three more years.

Three years.

They were abstract before. Now they're concrete. Wei had 125 years. Her children have seventeen and thirteen left. Not enough time to be ready. Just: time to be present.

"Mama," Maya says quietly. "What do we do now?"

"We keep living," Zara says. "We grieve. We remember. We carry her teaching forward. We keep living until we can't."

"Will we see her again? When we—"

"I don't know, baby. But if there's anything after, she'll be there. And if there's nothing, then she's at peace. Either way: she's okay."

They sit together in Wei's garden. The grave is fresh. The flowers bloom. The lemon tree drops fruit onto the earth.

Life continuing.

Death feeding it.

The cycle visible and true.

###

Kenji tells his mother.

Elena is making breakfast when he arrives at her apartment. She sees his face and knows immediately.

"Professor Wei?" she asks gently.

"Yes. Yesterday morning. Natural death. She was ready."

Elena pulls him into her arms. Kenji is thirty-six years old, but he cries like a child who lost his grandmother. Because that's what happened. Wei was grandmother, teacher, guide—the person who taught him to stop seeking, to be present, to accept impermanence.

Now she's impermanent.

Now she's gone.

The lesson made visceral.

"I'm so sorry," Elena says. "I know how much she meant to you."

"She changed my life. She taught me everything that matters."

"Then honor her. Live what she taught."

"I don't know how to do that without her."

"Yes you do. She gave you the tools. Now you use them."

Elena makes him tea. They sit together in quiet grief. Mother and son, both facing the reality that people die individually even while waiting for collective death.

"She wrote to me once," Elena says. "Said I governed with dignity. That it was wisdom. I didn't understand then. I do now."

"What did she mean?"

"That power is theater. That presence matters more than control. That bearing witness with dignity is enough." Elena touches Kenji's hand. "She taught you the same thing. Just: be here. Be present. That's enough."

"It doesn't feel like enough."

"It never does. But it is."

###

Days later, the funeral.

Lagos has a crematorium—one of the few still functioning. Zara brought Wei's body there, wrapped in white cloth, light as autumn leaves. The children came. Kwame. A dozen neighbors. Three former students still living in Lagos.

They gathered in the small ceremony room. No priest—Wei wasn't religious. No formal service—Wei didn't want one. Just: people who loved her, witnessing her departure.

Zara spoke because someone had to.

"Professor Wei taught us about impermanence. She said everything blooms and fades. She said meaning isn't in lasting but in being. She said the asteroid doesn't change this—life was always temporary." Her voice broke. Steadied. "She lived 125 years. She taught for seventy. She loved freely and died ready. That's everything."

Maya stood next. Thirteen years old, too young for this, too old to avoid it.

"Grandmother Wei told me to be present. Even when afraid. She said that's all that matters." Maya's voice was steady—too steady, holding back collapse. "I'm present now. I'm afraid now. She was right—it's all that matters."

The crematorium operator activated the chamber. Wei's body slid into flame.

Bloom and fade.

Being and unbeing.

Now Zara keeps the ashes in Wei's garden. Buried under the lemon tree. Wei becomes part of the garden she tended for decades.

###

Kenji creates a shrine in his apartment.

Small table near the window. Photo of Wei—one Zara sent months ago, Wei in her garden under the lemon tree, smiling gently. Candles. Incense. Simple offerings.

Not Buddhist practice exactly. Wei wasn't religious. But: ritual helps grief. Gives it form. Makes absence visible so you can honor it.

He sits before the shrine and meditates. Not praying—Wei didn't believe in prayer. Just: being present with the loss. Feeling it fully. Not pushing away, not clinging to. Just: observing grief like observing breath.

It hurts.

Wei would say: yes, it hurts. That's love persisting after loss. Feel it. Don't run from it.

So Kenji feels it. The ache in his chest. The emptiness where her wisdom used to live. The knowledge that he can't ask her questions anymore, can't sit in her garden, can't hear her gentle voice teaching about impermanence.

She's impermanent now.

The lesson is complete.

He cries in front of the shrine. Long, wrenching sobs. First person he loved who died. First experience with individual loss before collective loss.

This is practice. Wei knew that. Died deliberately, peacefully, showing him how it's done.

###

Week later, Zara finds Wei's letter.

Papers scattered through Wei's house—decades of writings, philosophy papers, letters, journals. And one addressed to her:

*Zara,*

*If you're reading this, I'm dead. Good. I was ready.*

*Thank you for caring for me. For being my neighbor. For letting your children love me. You made my last years beautiful. That's everything.*

*Keep teaching Maya and Kofi. Show them impermanence isn't terrible—it's true. Show them beauty exists because it's brief. Show them love matters because it doesn't last.*

*You chose to have Kofi after detection. That was the bravest thing I've seen. You chose life knowing it's brief. That's wisdom. That's everything.*

*Don't grieve me long. I lived fully. I died ready. Grieve, yes—but then: live. For three more years. Live fully. Be present. Love fiercely. Show your children how.*

*The flower bloomed.*

*That's enough.*

*Mei-Lin Wei*

Zara reads it three times. Cries each time. Then folds it carefully. Keeps it.

Three more years.

Live fully.

Show your children how.

###

That evening, Maya asks: "Will we be ready?"

They're in Wei's garden—Zara maintains it now, tending flowers that bloom over Wei's ashes. Maya helps, pulling weeds, watering plants. Kofi climbs the lemon tree despite being too old for climbing.

"Ready for what?" Zara asks, though she knows.

"To die. Like Grandmother Wei. She was ready. Will we be ready in three years?"

Zara sits back on her heels. Looks at her daughter—thirteen years old, carrying impossible weight, asking questions no child should ask.

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "Wei was 125. She lived a full life. You'll be sixteen. That's not old enough to be ready. Neither is Kofi at twelve. Neither is me at forty. We won't be ready."

"Then how do we do it?"

"Together. We don't do it ready. We just: do it together. Holding each other. Being present. Like Wei taught."

"But she was alone."

"She chose to be. Individual death is different—you get to choose witnesses, time, place. Collective death doesn't give us choices. But we have each other. That's something."

Maya is quiet. Then: "I'm scared."

"I know, baby. Me too."

"But you don't show it."

"I show it to Papa. And now to you. We can be scared together. Being scared is being present. Wei would approve."

They tend the garden. Kofi drops a lemon from the tree—ripe, yellow, perfect. They bring it inside. Make tea with it.

"Grandmother Wei is in this lemon," Kofi says seriously.

"Yes," Zara agrees. "She is."

Life continuing. Death feeding life. The cycle visible.

###

In Antarctica, Kenji visits his students.

Thirty-four children now. Ages six to fifteen. They sit in their circle, and Kenji tells them: "My teacher died. Professor Wei. She was 125 years old. She died peacefully, naturally, the old way of dying."

The children are quiet. Most have never experienced individual death. Everyone's parents are still alive, waiting for collective death.

"How did she do it?" Sarah asks—the defiant girl from the first day, now fifteen, one of Kenji's most dedicated students.

"She was ready. She lived fully. She said goodbye. She let go."

"Can we do that? When the asteroid comes?"

"I don't know. We won't be old. We won't have full lives behind us. But we can be present. We can be together. We can love each other until we can't." Kenji looks around the circle. "That's what Wei taught me. Presence matters more than readiness. Being here matters more than understanding why."

"I don't want to die," Marcus says—the small boy, now seven, still scared but still showing up.

"Neither do I. But we will. All of us. Together. And until then: we're alive. We practice being present. We love each other. We make these three years matter."

The class sits in silence. Processing. Grieving someone they never met. Practicing loss before Loss comes.

"Can we honor her?" Sarah asks. "Your teacher?"

"How?"

"By being present. Like she taught you. Like you teach us."

Kenji's chest tightens. "Yes. That's perfect. That's how we honor her."

They sit together. Breathing. Being present. Thirty-four children and one teacher, all dying, all choosing presence anyway.

Wei's teaching continues.

Through Kenji. Through these students. Through everyone she touched.

For three more years.

Then: silence.

But present now.

###

Month later, Kenji writes to Zara.

The networks are failing—messages take days, sometimes don't arrive. But he tries:

*Zara,*

*I'm sorry I couldn't be there for Wei's funeral. Travel is impossible. But I'm honoring her from here. Created a shrine. Meditate daily. Share her teachings with everyone who'll listen.*

*She changed my life. Taught me the seeking was the problem. That presence matters more than answers. That impermanence isn't terrible—it's true.*

*Thank you for caring for her. For letting Maya and Kofi love her. You made her last years beautiful.*

*I'm carrying her teaching forward. For three years. Until I can't. Then someone else. Then no one. But for now: it continues.*

*The flower bloomed.*

*That's enough.*

*With love and grief,  
Kenji*

He sends it. Doesn't know if it arrives. The writing helps. The remembering helps. The carrying forward helps.

###

In Lagos, Zara makes a decision.

"We're going to Antarctica," she tells Kwame. "Year 15. Few months before impact. I want the children to see it. I want to be with Amara at the end. I want us together."

"Travel might be impossible by then."

"Then we leave earlier. Year 14. Give ourselves time. But we're going. Wei is gone. Lagos is dying. I want my children to see what humanity built. I want them to meet their aunt. I want—" Her voice breaks. "I want us together. All of us. When it happens."

"Okay," Kwame says simply. "We'll go."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that. We're together. That's all that matters. Lagos or Antarctica—doesn't matter where we die. Matters who we're with."

Zara pulls him close. Her husband. Her partner. Father of her children.

"Wei taught me to let go," Zara says. "I'm learning. Slowly. But learning."

"What are you letting go of?"

"The future. The idea that they'll grow up. The fantasy that this doesn't happen. All of it. Just: being here now. With you. With them. For three years. That's all. That's enough."

"Is it?"

"It has to be."

###

One evening, sitting before Wei's shrine, Kenji realizes: she's preparing him.

Her death is practice for his own death. She showed him how it's done—peacefully, ready, surrounded by love, accepting what comes.

In three years, he dies too. Asteroid impact. Not natural, not peaceful, not ready. But: with people he loves. With his mother. With friends. Together.

Different death than Wei's. But death nonetheless.

She taught him: readiness doesn't matter. Presence matters. Be here now. Even when afraid. Especially when afraid.

He's not ready. Thirty-six years old. Should have decades more. Instead: three years.

But Wei taught him: should doesn't matter. Is matters.

Is: three years left. Is: mother alive. Is: friends present. Is: teachings to share. Is: moments to experience. Is: love to feel.

That's enough.

Has to be.

Wei lived 125 years and said it was enough. Kenji gets thirty-nine and must say the same.

Not equal. Not fair. But true.

The flower bloomed.

Brief or long, the blooming matters. Not the duration. The being.

###

In Lagos, they tend Wei's garden together.

Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi. Watering plants. Pulling weeds. Harvesting lemons. Making tea.

"Grandmother Wei is in everything now," Maya observes. "The soil. The tree. The flowers. The lemons."

"Yes," Zara agrees. "Her body feeds the garden. The garden feeds us. We carry her forward."

"Is that enough?" Kofi asks.

"Wei thought so. She said the flower bloomed. That was enough. Lasting forever doesn't matter. Being matters."

They work in silence. The garden grows. Wei's ashes nourish roots. Life continues.

Three years left.

Three years to bloom.

Three years to be present.

Then: fade.

Like Wei.

Like the gardenia.

Like everything.

Brief and perfect and true.

###

In Antarctica, Kenji teaches.

Every day. Thirty-four students. Presence. Impermanence. Non-clinging. Being here.

He tells them about Wei. About the gardenia. About learning that meaning is in being, not lasting.

The students listen. Practice. Carry forward.

Wei's teaching continues through them. For three years. Then silence.

But present now. Real now. Mattering now.

The shrine glows in Kenji's apartment. The garden grows in Lagos. The students practice in Antarctica.

Wei is gone.

Wei remains.

Both.

Always both.

That's the teaching.

That's the truth.

Individual loss before collective loss.

Practice grief before Grief.

Learn letting go before being let go of.

Mercy wrapped in pain.

Love persisting through absence.

Three years left.

Three years to honor her.

Three years to carry forward what she taught.

Three years to bloom.

Then: fade.

Together and separately.

In Lagos and Antarctica.

Through children and students.

Through memory and practice.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.

Always was.

Wei knew it.

Now they know it too.

Enough.
