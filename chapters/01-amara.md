# PART I: DETECTION

# Chapter 1 - Amara

The alert sounded at 3:47 AM.

Amara Okafor had been working the graveyard shift for twenty years—preferred it, actually. The station was quiet at night, just her and the automated systems humming their patient watch over the sky. No colleagues stopping by to chat, no meetings, no ceremonial bullshit. Just data, tea, and the clean satisfaction of verification protocols completed.

She was reviewing asteroid 2024-KJ9's updated trajectory—a near-Earth object they'd been tracking for months, safely predictable—when the AI system chirped. Not the routine ping of an orbital correction, but the high-priority alert she'd heard maybe three times in her entire career.

New detection. Unusual signature. High-priority classification pending.

Amara set down her tea and pulled up the data feed.

For a moment, she didn't understand what she was looking at. The numbers were wrong—had to be. Size estimate in the catastrophic range. Velocity vector pointing directly at Earth's orbital path. Impact probability climbing as the AI refined its calculations: 94.3%... 96.1%... 98.7%...

She ran the verification protocols. They confirmed.

She checked for system errors. None detected.

She pulled the raw telescope data and analyzed it manually, her hands moving across the holographic display with the automatic precision of two decades' practice. Parallax measurements from three different monitoring stations. Spectral analysis. Brightness curve. Orbital mechanics.

The asteroid was real. It was massive—somewhere between ten and fifteen kilometers across, she estimated. Civilization-killer scale. And it was coming at them fast, at an angle that made gravitational assist from any inner planet impossible.

Impact probability: 99.97%.

She sat back in her chair, staring at the screen.

Estimated time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days.

The station was very quiet. The automated systems hummed. Her tea was getting cold.

Amara's hands were shaking.

She made herself breathe. Think. *Can we deflect it?* That was the question. That was always the question. The UN Monitoring Program existed not just to detect but to coordinate response. They had contingency plans. Deflection scenarios. Nuclear options, kinetic impactors, gravity tractors—

She opened the deflection calculator and started entering parameters.

Mass: approximately 1.5 × 10^15 kg (conservative estimate).

Velocity: 28.3 km/s relative to Earth.

Time to impact: 15.18 years.

Required delta-v for minimal deflection to miss Earth: 0.3 cm/s, but needed years earlier in trajectory.

She ran the scenarios. Nuclear deflection: would require coordinated detonation of Earth's entire arsenal, and even then—she checked the numbers again—insufficient yield. Kinetic impactor: would need to launch within six months, required spacecraft ten times more massive than anything humanity had ever built. Gravity tractor: too slow, would need fifty years minimum.

She ran them again, adjusting parameters, trying to find a way.

The numbers didn't change.

She tried different approach vectors, different deflection timings, different thrust profiles. She worked through the equations with the cold precision of someone who had spent her entire adult life studying orbital mechanics. This was her field. This was what she knew.

Every scenario ended the same way.

*Not possible.*

Thirty-two minutes had passed since the alert.

Amara Okafor sat alone in the monitoring station, surrounded by screens full of data, and understood: Earth had fifteen years left. Everyone on it—all eight billion people—was going to die. Including her. Including David. Including Zara and little Maya.

And there was nothing she could do about it.

She picked up her comm and called Director Mbasa.

He answered after five rings, groggy. "Okafor? It's four in the morning—"

"We have an extinction-level asteroid," she said. Her voice sounded strange in her own ears. Calm. Clinical. Like she was reporting routine data. "Impact in fifteen years. I've run the deflection scenarios. None of them work."

Silence on the other end.

"I need you to verify my calculations," she continued. "But they're right. I've checked them six times. It's too big, too fast, too close. We can't stop it."

"Send me everything." His voice had changed—professional now, alert. "I'm coming in. Don't call anyone else until I verify."

"The AI has already distributed the data to the global monitoring network. It's flagged as extinction-level. The other stations will be seeing it now."

Another silence, longer this time.

"Christ," Mbasa said quietly. "Okay. Okay. I'm on my way. Okafor—"

"Yes?"

"Are you certain?"

"Yes."

She ended the call and sat looking at the screens. The asteroid was designated 2025-AZ1 now, the AI having catalogued it properly. Just a string of numbers and letters. It didn't look like much on the display—a point of light following a plotted trajectory, one red line intersecting another.

In fifteen years, that point of light would strike Earth's atmosphere at over 100,000 kilometers per hour. The impact would release energy equivalent to several billion nuclear weapons. The shockwave would circle the planet. The debris cloud would blot out the sun for years. Nothing larger than a rat would survive.

She should call David. She should call Zara. She should—

Her comm lit up again. Mayor Torres.

Amara accepted the call. Elena's face appeared, professional even at this hour, but her eyes were sharp with concern. "Dr. Okafor. I've received an alert from the monitoring network. Please tell me this is a false positive."

"It's not."

"The impact probability—"

"Is accurate. 99.97%. For practical purposes, certain."

Elena Torres was silent for a moment. Behind her, Amara could see the dim interior of the Mayor's residence, the soft glow of emergency lighting. She'd woken Elena up. She'd woken up the most powerful person on the planet to tell her that none of her power mattered anymore.

"Can we deflect it?" Elena asked.

"No."

"You're certain?"

"I've run every scenario. The mass, velocity, and time frame make deflection impossible with current technology. Even if we launched every spacecraft on Earth, even if we detonated our entire nuclear arsenal in a coordinated strike—it's not enough. We'd need at least thirty years and technology we don't have. We have fifteen."

Elena's face was very still. She was good at this, Amara thought distantly—at receiving catastrophic information without flinching. She'd been mayor of Antarctica for twelve years. She'd managed crises before.

Not like this, though. Nobody had managed a crisis like this.

"When will this become public knowledge?" Elena asked.

"The monitoring network has already flagged it as extinction-level. The AI systems are following protocol—verification from multiple stations, then global alert. I'd estimate within the next hour."

"An hour." Elena seemed to be calculating. "I need to convene the emergency council. I need to prepare a statement. I need to—" She stopped. For just a moment, the professional mask slipped, and Amara saw something underneath: fear. Raw and vast.

Then it was gone.

"Thank you, Dr. Okafor," Elena said quietly. "I know this isn't... thank you for calling me directly."

"Mayor Torres—Elena—"

"Yes?"

Amara found she didn't know what to say. *I'm sorry*? That seemed absurd. *We'll figure something out*? That was a lie. *It'll be okay*? It wouldn't be.

"Your son is in my lab," she said instead. "Kenji. He was working late on his dissertation analysis. He'll have seen the alert by now."

Elena's composure cracked just slightly. "Is he—"

"I'll tell him to call you."

"Thank you."

The call ended.

Amara sat alone again. The station hummed. The screens glowed. On the main display, asteroid 2025-AZ1 followed its plotted trajectory, that red line bisecting Earth's orbital path with mathematical precision.

She should go home. She should go to David, wake him up—except he might already be awake. The global alert would be going out any minute. The whole planet would know.

Instead, she opened a new comm channel and called her sister.

It rang four times before Zara answered, bleary and confused. "Amara? It's the middle of the night—well, for you. What's—"

"Turn on the news," Amara said. "There's going to be an alert."

"What kind of alert?"

"Just turn it on."

She heard rustling, Zara moving around in her home in Lagos. In the background, a child's voice—Maya, two years old. "Mama, what's wrong?"

"Nothing, sweetheart. Mama's just—" Then Zara's sharp intake of breath. She'd turned on the feed. "Amara. What am I looking at?"

"An asteroid. Impact in fifteen years."

"Can you stop it?"

The question she'd been asking herself for the last forty-five minutes.

"No," Amara said.

The silence on the other end was different from Elena's professional pause or Director Mbasa's stunned hesitation. This was her sister. This was Zara, who called her every week to share stories about Maya, who'd always believed Amara could fix anything because she was the smart one, the scientist, the one who understood how the universe worked.

"No?" Zara's voice was very small. "You mean—"

"I mean in fifteen years, an asteroid is going to hit Earth and there's nothing we can do to stop it. I've run the calculations. It's too big, too fast. We don't have the technology or the time."

"But Maya—" Zara's voice broke. "She's two. She'll be—"

"Seventeen." Amara felt something crack open inside her chest. "She'll be seventeen."

She heard Zara start to cry. In the background, Maya's confused voice: "Mama? Mama, why are you crying?"

"I'm sorry," Amara said, knowing it was meaningless. "I'm so sorry. I wanted to—I wanted you to hear it from me first, before—"

"Before the world ends," Zara finished. She was crying harder now. "Amara, what do I—how do I—"

"I don't know." Amara's hands were shaking again. She pressed them flat against the desk. "I have to go. The director is coming in. There are protocols, there's—I have to go. But I wanted to call you first."

"Okay." Zara's voice was thick with tears. "Okay. Call me later? When you can?"

"I will."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

Amara ended the call and sat staring at nothing.

The global alert would be going out now. The AI systems had verified from multiple stations, cross-checked the calculations, confirmed the extinction-level classification. Across the planet, billions of people were waking up to emergency broadcasts. Asteroid detected. Impact certain. Fifteen years.

Her comm buzzed again. David.

She accepted the call, and his face appeared—her husband of twenty-three years, graying now but still familiar, still home. He was sitting up in their bed, the bedroom lights off except for the glow from his comm.

"I saw the alert," he said. His voice was steady, but she could see the tightness around his eyes. "Are you okay?"

"I'm the one who detected it," she said.

"Oh." He was quiet for a moment. "So you've known for—"

"About an hour."

"Can we stop it?"

"No."

She watched him process that. Watched the reality settle over him the way it had settled over her, over Elena, over Zara. The end of the world, delivered in a simple monosyllable. *No.*

"Are you coming home?" he asked.

"I need to stay. The director is coming in. There are going to be meetings, briefings. We need to—" She stopped. *Need to what?* Make a plan? For what? "I need to be here."

"Okay." He was looking at her with that expression she knew, the one that meant he understood she was keeping herself together by force of will and if he pushed too hard right now she'd break. "I'll be here when you get back."

"David—"

"Yeah?"

*I'm scared,* she wanted to say. *I don't know what to do. I've spent my entire career preparing for this scenario and now that it's real I don't know what to do.*

"Nothing," she said. "I'll see you later."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

The call ended.

Amara sat alone in the monitoring station as the sun started to rise over Antarctica, as eight billion people woke to learn they had fifteen years left, as the world began to fracture in ways she couldn't calculate.

On her screen, asteroid 2025-AZ1 continued its approach, following the immutable laws of physics with perfect, uncaring precision.

She picked up her cold tea and tried to drink it, but her hands were shaking too much.

Outside, in the city, she heard the first sirens start to wail.
