# Chapter 13 - Zara

Maya is seven years old. Kofi is four.

Zara watches them play in Professor Wei's garden—Maya showing her brother how to pick lemons without damaging the tree, Kofi's small hands reaching up, tongue between his teeth in concentration.

"Gentle, Kofi! Like this."

"I doing it!"

"You're doing it," Maya corrects automatically, then beams when he successfully picks a lemon. "Good job!"

They're beautiful. Her children. Temporary and precious and doomed.

Maya will die at seventeen. Kofi at fourteen.

Ten years left for Maya. Eleven for Kofi.

The math is constant. Unavoidable. Every milestone measured against the countdown.

But right now, in this moment, they're alive. They're playing. They're here.

Zara has learned to hold both truths simultaneously. The grief and the joy. The ending and the present. The temporary nature of everything and the absolute reality of now.

It's the hardest thing she's ever done.

---

Two years ago, when Kofi was born, people called her cruel.

Bringing a child into a dying world. Condemning him to a short life. Selfish. Irresponsible. Monstrous.

Zara heard all of it. Some to her face, more behind her back.

She didn't care.

Or rather—she did care, it hurt, but she didn't regret.

Because Kofi exists. Because Maya has a brother. Because their small apartment is filled with life instead of waiting for death.

Because she chose defiance over resignation.

Now, two years later, watching Kofi toddle after his sister, hearing him laugh, seeing him discover the world—she'd make the same choice again.

Even knowing it ends. Even knowing he'll die young. Even knowing the grief will be unbearable.

She'd choose him every time.

---

Professor Wei sits on her bench, watching the children with ancient, knowing eyes.

The old woman is one hundred seventeen now. Frailer than ever. She uses a wheelchair most days, though she insists on sitting in the garden when the weather allows.

Zara pushes Wei's chair closer to the shade of the lemon tree.

"Thank you, dear."

"They're getting so big," Zara says, watching Maya and Kofi. "Maya's reading chapter books now. Kofi knows all his colors and numbers to twenty."

"You're teaching them well."

"I'm teaching them everything. History, math, science, philosophy. Languages—Maya's learning Mandarin from an AI tutor. Art, music, how to swim, how to cook." Zara's voice catches. "I'm trying to fit a lifetime of education into seven years for Maya. Ten for Kofi."

"Why?"

The question surprises Zara. "Because they should know things. Because knowledge is valuable. Because—"

"Because you're still future-oriented," Wei says gently. "You're teaching them as if they'll use these skills. As if there's a life ahead where knowing Mandarin matters."

Zara sits down heavily on the bench. "What else should I do? Let them grow up ignorant?"

"No. But perhaps teach them what matters for the time they have. Not skills for a future that doesn't exist. But presence for the present that does."

"I don't know how to teach that."

"You already are. Watch them."

Zara watches. Maya and Kofi are no longer focused on picking lemons. Kofi found a caterpillar on a leaf and is mesmerized. Maya crouches beside him, equally fascinated.

"Bug!" Kofi whispers.

"It's a caterpillar," Maya says. "It eats leaves and then turns into a butterfly."

"Magic?"

"Kind of. It's called metamorphosis."

They're completely absorbed. Not thinking about the asteroid. Not calculating remaining time. Just: here, now, amazed by a caterpillar.

"They already know how to be present," Wei says. "They don't need you to teach that. They need you to not teach them otherwise. To let them stay in wonder instead of pulling them into grief."

"But they need to understand reality. They need to know—"

"They know enough. Maya knows the world is ending. She asked you directly and you told her truth. That's enough. Now let her be seven. Let Kofi be four. Don't weight them down with adult grief they'll carry soon enough."

Zara feels tears coming. "I'm so scared. Scared of wasting their time. Scared of not teaching them enough. Scared of the moment when they really understand what's coming. Maya still has hope sometimes. She talks about 'when I'm grown up' like it might happen. How do I—how do I let her have that hope when I know it's false?"

"Is it false? She is growing up. She'll be twelve, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen. She'll grow up right up until she doesn't. The hope isn't false. The timeline is just shorter than she imagines."

"That feels like lying."

"It feels like letting her be a child."

The caterpillar inches across Kofi's palm. He giggles. Maya steadies his hand so it doesn't fall.

Zara watches her children and thinks: Wei is right. They know how to be present. I'm the one struggling.

---

That night, after both children are asleep, Zara sits with Kwame on their small balcony.

Lagos stretches below them—lights flickering, some districts dark, the city changing but still alive. Less crowded than five years ago. Many fled. Many died. But enough remain. Life continuing stubbornly.

"I talked to my supervisor today," Kwame says. "They're scaling down the water treatment systems. Not enough staff to maintain everything. They want me to choose which districts get priority."

"That's impossible."

"I know. But that's the reality. We can't maintain the whole infrastructure anymore. So someone has to decide: which neighborhoods get clean water? Which ones are left with minimal service?"

Zara leans against him. "How do you choose?"

"I don't know. Population density? Areas with children? Random? It's all terrible."

"Are you going to quit?"

"And do what? Travel? Party? Wait for death?" He shakes his head. "No. I'd rather keep working. Keep helping who I can. It's not enough. But it's something."

"We sound so pragmatic. 'It's not enough but it's something.' That's our motto now."

"What else can we do?"

They sit in silence. Below, someone is having a party. Music drifts up. Laughter. Life happening.

"Amara called today," Zara says. "First time in six months."

"How is she?"

"Different. She says she's trying to reconnect with David. That she wasted years hiding in work. She wants to see us. Wants us to come to Antarctica in Year 15. For the end."

"Do you want to go?"

"Yes. I want Maya and Kofi to see the megacity. Want them to meet their aunt properly. Want to spend our final time with family." She pauses. "But I'm also terrified. Year 15. That's when it happens. When we all—when it ends."

Kwame takes her hand. "We'll go. We'll spend the final months together. All of us. It's what family does."

"Even though the children—"

"Especially because of the children. They should see the world. Should meet their aunt and uncle. Should have those experiences. Even if they're the last ones."

Zara nods. Squeezes his hand. "I love you."

"I love you too. And I love what you're doing. With the kids. Teaching them. Showing them wonder. Not giving up."

"I'm terrified I'm doing it wrong."

"There is no right way to raise children when the world is ending. You're doing it with love. That's enough."

Is it? Zara doesn't know. But she doesn't have another option.

So she'll keep teaching. Keep loving. Keep choosing presence and life and wonder.

Even when it breaks her heart.

Especially then.

Six months later, Maya asks the question Zara has been dreading.

They're at the ocean—one of the coastal parks that still functions. Maya is splashing in the waves. Kofi is building sandcastles with elaborate concentration. Kwame is helping him find the best shells.

Maya comes out of the water, dripping, smiling. Sits beside Zara on the blanket.

"Mama, when I'm grown up, I want to be a scientist like Auntie Amara."

Zara's heart stops.

"A scientist?"

"Yeah! I want to study the ocean. Did you know there are fish that live so deep they make their own light? That's amazing! I want to discover new ones. I want to understand how they evolved. I want—"

"Maya." Zara's voice is too tight.

Her daughter looks at her. "What?"

This is the moment. The moment to tell her. To explain that she won't be a scientist. Won't be an adult. Won't grow up.

But Maya is seven. She's happy. She's dreaming. She's being a child.

Zara thinks of Professor Wei's words: *Let her be seven.*

"That sounds wonderful," Zara says, forcing her voice steady. "The ocean is amazing. You'd be a great scientist."

Maya beams. "Will you help me learn about fish?"

"Of course."

Maya runs back to the water. Calls for Kofi to come see something. They splash together, laughing, alive.

Kwame looks at Zara. Sees the tears on her face. Comes over.

"You told her she could be a scientist."

"I couldn't—I couldn't take that from her. Not today. She's seven. She should get to dream."

"Even though—"

"Even though." Zara wipes her face. "Professor Wei says they know enough. That they'll understand more as they get older. That I don't have to crush every hope before it's time. So I'm letting her dream. Is that wrong?"

"I don't know. But it's kind. And kindness matters."

They watch their children play in the ocean. Temporary. Precious. Here.

Ten years left for Maya. Eleven for Kofi.

But today—today they're just children at the beach. Discovering shells and fish and wonder.

That has to be enough.

---

One evening, Zara finds Maya crying in her room.

"Baby, what's wrong?"

Maya looks up, face wet. "Sasha's family is leaving."

Sasha is her best friend from the neighborhood. They've known each other since they were three.

"Leaving Lagos?"

"Going to India. Her parents say they want to see the temples before everything ends. They're leaving next week." Maya sobs. "I'll never see her again."

Zara sits on the bed, pulls her daughter close. "I'm sorry, sweetheart."

"Why do people leave? Why can't we all stay together?"

"Everyone is handling this differently. Some people want to stay home. Some want to travel. Some want to be alone. Some want to be with family. There's no right way."

"It's not fair. We already don't have much time. Now I lose Sasha too?"

"I know. It's not fair. None of this is fair."

Maya cries against her. Zara holds her, lets her grieve. This is the reality—not just the asteroid death, but all the small deaths along the way. Friends leaving. People dying. Everything falling apart slowly before the final end.

"Mama, are we going to stay in Lagos?"

"Yes. This is our home. We'll stay here. Work here. Live here. Until—" She stops.

"Until Year 15?"

"Yes."

"Auntie Amara wants us to visit Antarctica that year."

"She does. Would you want to? To see the megacity? Meet your aunt and uncle properly?"

Maya thinks about it. "Yes. I want to see the world. Even if..." She doesn't finish.

"Even if it's the last time."

"Yeah."

They sit together. Mother and daughter. Holding each other through grief neither of them asked for.

"I love you," Zara says.

"I love you too, Mama." Maya pulls back, wipes her face. "Will you tell me about fish that make light?"

The subject change is abrupt but Zara understands. Sometimes grief is too heavy. Sometimes you need to talk about bioluminescent fish instead.

"Yes. Let me find some videos."

They curl up together, watching deep-sea creatures glow in the darkness. Kofi wanders in, climbs onto the bed, falls asleep between them.

Kwame finds them like that an hour later—his family, tangled together, watching fish on a screen, alive and temporary and here.

He joins them. Completes the picture.

This is what matters, Zara thinks. Not the future they won't have. But this moment. This love. This presence.

Professor Wei was right.

They already know what's important.

She just has to let them live it.

---

Five years after the detection, Zara writes in her journal—something she started after Kofi was born, documenting their lives for no one but herself:

*Maya is 7. Kofi is 4. Ten years left.*

*Today we went to the ocean. Maya wants to be a scientist. I didn't correct her. I let her dream. Professor Wei says this is right. I hope she's right.*

*Kofi is obsessed with caterpillars and butterflies. He doesn't understand yet that he won't live long enough to see most of his questions answered. Maybe that's a blessing.*

*I'm teaching them everything—but Wei reminds me they already know what matters. Presence. Wonder. Love. The rest is just facts.*

*Kwame is struggling with work. Choosing which neighborhoods get water. Impossible decisions. But he keeps showing up. We both do. For the children. For each other. For Lagos.*

*Amara is reconnecting with David. I'm glad. I want my sister to have love before the end. Want to see her again. Want my children to know their aunt.*

*Ten years left. Then nine years, eleven months. Then nine years, ten months.*

*The countdown never stops. But neither does the living.*

*My children are alive. Today they played in the ocean. Today they laughed. Today they were here.*

*That's everything.*

*That's enough.*
