# Chapter 5 - Kenji

Kenji was in the lab when Dr. Okafor went pale.

It was past midnight—he'd been working late on his dissertation analysis, running simulations of asteroid deflection scenarios. Theoretical work, academic exercises. The kind of calculations that assumed humanity had time to implement them.

Dr. Okafor sat at her workstation across the lab, reviewing data from the monitoring network. She'd been quiet for the past hour, which wasn't unusual. She was an intense mentor, demanding but fair, and she respected his need to work in focused silence.

Then she made a sound—small, sharp, like someone had punched her.

"Dr. Okafor?" Kenji looked up from his screen. "Are you okay?"

She didn't answer. Just stared at her display, her face draining of color.

Kenji got up and crossed the lab. "What is it?"

She pulled up the data without speaking. Kenji looked at the numbers and understood immediately. He'd been studying asteroid threats for four years. He knew how to read trajectory plots, impact probabilities, deflection windows.

This was an extinction-level event.

"Can we stop it?" he asked, already knowing the answer but needing to hear it said.

"No."

The word hung in the air between them. Final. Absolute.

Kenji looked at the data again. Fifteen years, two months, fourteen days. He'd be thirty-nine. His mother would be seventy-eight. They'd both die before reaching the age his father had died at.

His father, who'd died in a transit tunnel accident when Kenji was five. His mother had told him over and over: it wasn't fair, he was too young, they should have had more time. She'd grieved for years.

Now she'd lose her son too. And herself. And everyone.

"Your mother needs to know," Dr. Okafor said, her voice distant and clinical. The professional mask sliding into place. "I should call her. The alert will go out soon, but she should hear it from—"

"I'll tell her," Kenji said.

"No, I should—"

"I'll tell her." He was already moving toward the door. "I need to see her anyway."

Dr. Okafor didn't argue. She turned back to her screens, already making calls, following protocols. Being the competent scientist everyone needed her to be.

Kenji left her there and walked out into the night.

Antarctica was waking to the news.

As Kenji walked through the streets of McMurdo District, he watched the city fracture in real-time. Emergency alerts flashing on every screen. People stumbling out of buildings, comms pressed to their ears, faces stunned. Someone was shouting. Someone else was crying. In an alley, he saw a man bent over, vomiting.

The end of the world sounded like chaos.

Kenji walked through it in a strange bubble of calm. His mind was working too fast, processing too many things at once. Fifteen years. That was 5,475 days. He'd wasted 8,760 of them on a PhD that now meant nothing. He'd been planning a career studying asteroids, learning to detect and deflect them.

Well, they'd detected one. Couldn't deflect it.

His entire field of study rendered pointless in one night.

But that wasn't what bothered him most. What bothered him was the sudden, terrible clarity: he didn't know how to live fifteen years. He'd been living like he had eighty years, maybe a hundred with modern medicine. Planning far ahead. Building toward a future that had just evaporated.

How did you live when there was no future to build toward?

He found himself outside the mayoral complex. Security was chaos—people demanding access, demanding answers, demanding his mother fix this. She couldn't fix this. She was the most powerful person on the continent and she couldn't do anything.

Kenji used his old access code and slipped in through the private entrance. Went up to her office. She wasn't there—in an emergency meeting somewhere. He waited.

She found him an hour later, sitting in her office in the dark.

"Kenji." She looked exhausted, older than he'd ever seen her. "How did you—Dr. Okafor told you?"

"I was there when she detected it."

His mother crossed the room and pulled him into an embrace. Kenji was taller than her now, had been since he was fifteen, but in that moment he felt small. Like a child who'd scraped his knee and needed his mother to make it better.

Except his mother couldn't make this better.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I'm so sorry."

"It's not your fault."

But it felt like it was. Irrationally, unfairly, but true. She was the mayor. The leader. The one who was supposed to keep people safe. She'd failed at the most fundamental level—she hadn't kept the world from ending.

"I don't know what to do," she said, and that was terrifying. His mother always knew what to do. That was her job, her identity. Mayor Torres, competent and commanding.

Now she was just Elena. Just his mom. Just as lost as he was.

They held each other while the city fell apart outside.

---

Kenji went home eventually. His small apartment in the university district, graduate student housing he'd been planning to leave next year when he finished his dissertation. The apartment would outlast him now. Everything would outlast him by about fifteen years, and then nothing would outlast anything.

He sat on his couch and tried to process it. Fifteen years. How did you spend fifteen years?

His comm was filling with messages. Friends panicking. Classmates reaching out. One message from his advisor asking if he'd be continuing his research.

His research. Asteroid deflection strategies.

Kenji started laughing. Couldn't help it. Hysterical, jagged laughter that hurt his chest. He'd spent four years studying how to save the world from exactly this scenario, and now that it was happening, his research was useless. They couldn't save the world. The world was ending.

The laughter turned to crying.

He cried for a while—for himself, for his mother, for Dr. Okafor who'd had to detect humanity's extinction, for the billions of people learning right now that their futures had just been deleted.

Then he stopped crying and felt... nothing. Numb. Empty.

Fifteen years.

What did you do with fifteen years when they didn't lead anywhere?

---

Three days later, Kenji dropped out of his PhD program.

The decision felt inevitable. What was the point of finishing a dissertation on asteroid deflection? Who was going to read it? Who cared about his contribution to a field that had just been proven inadequate at the only task that mattered?

His advisor tried to talk him out of it. "We still need to understand—"

"Why?" Kenji interrupted. "So we can write papers about how we failed? So we can spend the next fifteen years explaining exactly why we couldn't save ourselves?"

"Knowledge matters—"

"No, it doesn't." Kenji felt something fierce and angry rising in him. "Knowledge doesn't matter if everyone dies. Understanding doesn't matter if we can't change anything. I've spent four years of a fifteen-year countdown studying how to prevent this, and now that it's here, I can't do anything. None of us can. So what's the point?"

His advisor had no answer.

Kenji walked out of the university and never went back.

That night, someone from his cohort messaged him about a party. End-of-the-world celebration in the entertainment district. Everyone getting drunk, high, trying to feel something other than terror.

Kenji went.

The party was chaos. Music so loud it hurt, people dancing with desperate energy, substances being passed around openly. No one cared about laws anymore. No one cared about consequences. What were they going to do, arrest you? For fifteen years?

Kenji drank. Took something someone offered him—he didn't ask what. Danced with strangers whose names he didn't learn. Kissed someone in a dark corner. Went home with someone else.

Woke up the next morning feeling hollow.

He did it again the next night. And the next. And the next.

Six months passed in a blur of parties and substances and meaningless encounters. Kenji was trying to feel something—anything. Pleasure, connection, release. Trying to fill the enormous void where his future used to be.

It didn't work. Nothing filled it.

One morning, he woke up on someone's floor—he didn't remember whose—surrounded by passed-out bodies. The apartment was trashed. Someone had vomited in the corner. It smelled like desperation and decay.

Kenji looked at the bodies scattered around him. Some were breathing heavily, some perfectly still. For a moment, he couldn't tell which were asleep and which were dead.

He got up and left.

Walked through the city as dawn broke. Antarctica was different now. Quieter. Fewer people on the streets. Buildings with dark windows. The slow contraction of a civilization that knew it was ending.

He went to his mother's office. She was there, of course. Always working. She looked up when he entered, surprised.

"Kenji."

"I'm leaving," he said.

"What?"

"I'm leaving Antarctica. I need to... I don't know. Find something. Anything. I can't stay here."

His mother stood up from her desk. She looked older than she had six months ago. Tired. "Where will you go?"

"I don't know. Lagos maybe. Jerusalem. Somewhere that isn't here. Somewhere that might have answers."

"Answers to what?"

"How to live fifteen years."

His mother crossed to him, took his hands. "Kenji, you don't need to go halfway across the world to figure that out."

"I do." He looked at her—his powerful, competent mother who couldn't save the world, couldn't save him. "I've spent six months trying to numb it, and it doesn't work. Parties don't work. Substances don't work. Pretending I don't care doesn't work. I need to find out what does."

"And you think you'll find that in Lagos? In Jerusalem?"

"I don't know. But I have to look."

She was crying. "What if something happens to you? What if you're somewhere far away when—"

"When the world ends?" He squeezed her hands. "Mom, it doesn't matter where I am. The asteroid is going to hit. We're all going to die. At least let me spend the time looking for something that matters."

She pulled him into an embrace. "Be careful. Come home sometimes. Please."

"I will."

"I love you."

"I love you too."

He left the next week. Booked passage to Lagos—transport was still running, though less reliably than before. People were still going places, though fewer knew why.

Kenji boarded the transport with a small bag and no plan. Just a desperate, hungry need to find some way to make fifteen years mean something.

He looked out the window as Antarctica fell away behind him. His mother was down there somewhere, alone in her office, trying to lead a city that was slowly dying. Dr. Okafor was there too, still calculating deflection scenarios that couldn't work. David Chen maintaining solar panels that would exist for fifteen years and then vapor.

All of them going through motions, following routines, doing what they'd always done because no one knew what else to do.

Kenji was going to find another way.

He had to.

---

The transport landed in Lagos two days later.

Kenji stepped out into humid air, into a city that looked nothing like Antarctica. Where Antarctica was ordered and engineered, Lagos was organic and sprawling. Built on the ruins of the old city after the sea level rise, it had grown in chaotic layers—new towers mixed with ancient structures, hydroponic terraces cascading down buildings, solar canopies stretched between rooftops.

It felt alive in a way Antarctica hadn't in months.

Kenji found cheap housing in the university district and started walking. Just walking through the city, watching people. Some were broken like Antarctica—empty buildings, darkened streets, the marks of despair. But some were different. Markets still operating. Children playing in parks. People gathering in temples and churches and community halls.

Not pretending the world wasn't ending. But living anyway.

He watched a Buddhist monk give a teaching in a park. Listened to a Christian preacher talking about grace. Sat in on a Muslim prayer service, not understanding the Arabic but feeling the communal rhythm of it.

Everyone had answers. None of them felt right.

But they felt like something. They felt like people facing the void and choosing to create meaning in it rather than just drowning.

Kenji kept walking. Kept watching. Kept searching.

Somewhere in this dying world, there had to be an answer to how to live fifteen years.

He had fourteen and a half left to find it.
