# Chapter 28: Zara

Maya stands in the ruins of old Lagos, twelve years old and serious, looking at the flooded streets where buildings used to rise. The sea claimed this district twenty years ago—before Forever Earth, before adaptation, before Antarctica became humanity's answer to rising oceans.

"Why are we here?" she asks.

Zara crouches beside her daughter. Kofi, eight years old, climbs on the rubble, fearless. Behind them, Lagos stretches—three million people still living, still thriving, still making life matter despite the countdown.

Year 10. Five years until impact.

"Because this is history," Zara says. "This is where people lived. Where they loved and worked and raised children. It's underwater now, but it mattered. They mattered."

"But why show us?" Maya asks. "We'll never be historians. We'll never teach anyone else."

The question lands heavy. True and impossible to answer simply.

"Because it matters anyway," Zara says. "Because knowing where you come from matters. Because witnessing matters. Because—" She touches Maya's face gently. "Because you matter. And everything you know, everything you learn, everything you carry—that matters too. Even if it's brief."

"Everything is brief," Maya says.

"Yes. But that doesn't make it meaningless."

Kofi jumps from one piece of rubble to another, laughing. He's young enough to still live in the present, old enough to know what's coming, but not old enough to feel the weight crushing.

Maya feels it. Zara sees it in her daughter's eyes—the knowledge, the grief, the impossible question: why exist at all?

"Come on," Zara says. "Let's go see Professor Wei. She'll have better answers than me."

They take the transit back to their district. Wei's compound is next door—small house, beautiful garden, 124-year-old philosopher who's become the children's grandmother in all but blood.

Wei sits in her garden, under the lemon tree, eyes closed. Not meditating—just resting. Her body is so frail now. Zara helps her with daily tasks—bathing, dressing, moving from bed to chair. Wei's mind is still sharp, but her body is preparing for the end.

Individual death. Before the collective death. The old way of dying.

"Grandmother Wei!" Kofi runs ahead, stops himself before crashing into her. "We went to the old city! It's all water!"

Wei opens her eyes slowly. Smiles. "Did you swim?"

"No! Mama said it's dangerous. But I wanted to."

"Of course you did. You're eight. Eight-year-olds should want to swim in dangerous water."

Maya sits beside Wei more carefully. "Why do we learn history if there's no future?"

Wei looks at Zara—a glance that says: *this is your daughter, brilliant and struggling.* Then to Maya: "Why do flowers bloom if they're going to die?"

"Because they're alive now," Maya says automatically.

"Yes. Because they're alive now." Wei touches Maya's hand. "You're alive now. Learning history makes you more alive. Understanding your ancestors, where you came from, what they built—that enriches your now. Even if your now is brief."

"But it feels pointless."

"Pointless and meaningful aren't opposites. Many meaningful things are pointless. Love is pointless. Beauty is pointless. Learning is pointless. They don't achieve anything permanent. They just: matter while they happen."

Maya is quiet. Processing. Zara watches her daughter think—always thinking, always questioning, already wiser than Zara was at twelve. Already carrying weight no child should carry.

"I'm making tea," Zara says. "Kofi, help me?"

"But I want to stay with Grandmother—"

"Help me, please."

Kofi follows reluctantly. In Wei's small kitchen, Zara makes tea while her son climbs on the counter, chattering about swimming and ruins and the big trip to Antarctica Mama keeps promising.

Through the window, she watches Maya and Wei talk. Can't hear the words. But sees Maya lean against Wei's frail shoulder. Sees Wei's ancient hand on Maya's young head. Sees comfort passing between them.

This is what Zara wanted. Community. Love. Presence. People who make their children's brief lives meaningful.

Professor Wei has been that. Neighbor, teacher, grandmother. Showing Maya and Kofi how to be present, how to accept impermanence, how to bloom even while dying.

Wei is dying. Not from the asteroid—from age, from time, from the old natural death that still exists for a few more years.

Zara is grateful for it. Grateful the children will experience individual loss before collective loss. Grateful Wei will die peacefully, ready, showing them how it's done.

Grateful and devastated.

That evening, after the children are asleep, Zara sits with Kwame on their small porch.

"Maya asked why we teach them," Zara says.

"What did you say?"

"That it matters anyway. That brief doesn't mean meaningless." She leans against her husband. "Do you think that's true?"

"Yes. I think it's the only truth." Kwame kisses her head. "We chose to have them. We chose to love them. We chose to make their brief lives as rich as possible. That was right."

"Was it?"

"Zara." He turns her to face him. "I've never regretted Maya or Kofi. Not once. Not even knowing. They're the best thing we ever did."

"But they're dying."

"We're all dying. We were always dying. They're just dying sooner than we pretended they would." Kwame takes her hands. "Would you trade it? Would you undo having them?"

"Never."

"Then we did right."

Zara closes her eyes. Breathes. Her husband's steady presence. Her children sleeping inside. Professor Wei dying next door. Lagos breathing around them. Life continuing because what else would it do?

"Amara confirmed Year 15," Zara says. "She wants us to come to Antarctica. All of us. Meet her and David. Be together at the end."

"Good. The children should see the megacity. Should meet their aunt properly. Should know where their mother came from."

"You think we can make it? The transport systems are barely functioning."

"We'll make it. We have to. Five years to plan. We'll make it work."

They sit in comfortable silence. Inside, Maya and Kofi breathe in sleep. Next door, Wei breathes shallow and slow. Around them, Lagos lives—music from somewhere, voices calling, the constant hum of humanity existing until it can't.

"I'm scared," Zara whispers.

"I know."

"Not of dying. Of them dying. Of watching them die. Of that moment when—"

"I know. Me too."

"How do we bear it?"

"Together. Like everything else. Together."

Zara leans into him. Her partner. Her choice. The father of her children. They'll face the end together—watching their children die, dying themselves, holding each other through the impossible.

If they have to die, at least it's like this. At least it's together. At least it's with love.

At least it matters.

The next morning, Wei asks Zara to help her to the garden. The walk is slow—Wei's legs barely support her, her breathing labored. But she insists on sitting under the lemon tree, in the morning light, with the flowers blooming around her.

"I'm dying," Wei says simply.

Zara's chest tightens. "I know."

"Soon. Maybe months. Maybe weeks. Not years."

"You don't know that—"

"Zara. I'm 124 years old. I know." Wei smiles gently. "I'm telling you because you need to prepare. Maya and Kofi need to prepare. This will be their first death. Their first individual loss before the collective loss."

"They love you."

"I love them too. That's why I'm telling you. They'll grieve. That's good. Grief means love happened. But then: they keep living. Keep being present. Keep blooming until they can't."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. "I don't know how to do this."

"Yes you do. You've been doing it since detection. Loving fiercely despite knowing it's brief. Being present despite knowing it's temporary. That's all grief is—love persisting after loss."

"I'm not ready."

"No one's ever ready. I'm ready—I've lived 124 years. But you're not, and the children aren't, and that's okay. You'll grieve anyway. You'll survive anyway. You'll keep loving anyway."

Wei touches Zara's face—frail hand, gentle pressure. "Thank you for caring for me. Thank you for letting your children love me. Thank you for making my last years beautiful."

"You made ours beautiful too."

"Good. Then we're even."

They sit in the garden—old woman and younger woman, philosopher and engineer, grandmother and mother by choice. The flowers bloom around them. The lemon tree drops fruit. Lagos lives.

Everything temporary.

Everything precious.

Everything enough.

Week later, Zara takes a family portrait.

Her, Kwame, Maya, Kofi—and Professor Wei, sitting in the center, frail but present. They gather in Wei's garden, under the lemon tree, everyone smiling despite knowing this might be the last photo.

The camera captures it: five people, three generations, choosing to love despite impermanence. Choosing to be present despite grief approaching. Choosing to matter while they can.

Maya asks to take one of just Wei. Wei agrees. Maya photographs her—ancient face, kind eyes, gentle smile. The image of someone ready, someone at peace, someone who lived fully and is prepared to die completely.

Later, Maya shows Zara the photo. "Can we print it? So I remember her after—"

"Yes. We'll print it."

"Will I forget what she looks like?"

"Maybe. Eventually. But you'll remember what she taught you. How she made you feel. The wisdom she shared. That stays."

"How do you know?"

"Because I remember my grandmother. She died when I was seven. I barely remember her face. But I remember her hands—how she touched my hair, how she held me. I remember her voice—how it sounded when she said my name. That's what stays. The love. Not the details."

Maya nods, processing. Then: "I'm glad we know her now. Even if it hurts later."

"Me too, baby. Me too."

That night, Zara frames the family portrait. Hangs it in their living space—five people, three generations, loving despite everything.

Proof they existed.

Proof they mattered.

Proof love happened here.

Brief and temporary and absolutely real.

Month later, planning the Antarctica trip, Maya asks: "Will Grandmother Wei come with us?"

Zara's chest tightens. "No, baby. She'll be gone by then."

"Dead?"

"Yes."

"Before the asteroid?"

"Yes. Individual death. The old way of dying."

Kofi looks up from his drawing. "Is that better? Or worse?"

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "She'll die alone. We'll die together. Both are hard. Both are okay."

"I don't want her to die alone," Maya says.

"She won't be alone. We'll be with her. As much as we can."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Zara pulls her children close. These brilliant, doomed, precious humans she chose to create. Who will die in five years. Who will never be adults. Who will never have children. Who will never continue the species.

Who matter absolutely.

Who are loved completely.

Who make every moment worth existing through.

"I love you both so much," Zara whispers.

"We know, Mama," Maya says.

"We love you too," Kofi adds. "Even when you're sad."

"I'm not sad. I'm grateful."

"You can be both," Maya observes. "Like Grandmother Wei teaches. Hold everything at once."

"Yes. Exactly like that."

They sit together—mother and children, holding everything, loving despite knowing, being present despite grief approaching.

Outside, Lagos breathes. Inside, family exists. Next door, Wei dies slowly, teaching to the end.

Five years left.

Five years to love.

Five years to be present.

Five years to make it all matter.

Not enough.

But everything.

Always everything.

The portrait hangs on the wall. The flowers bloom in Wei's garden. The children grow despite knowing they won't grow old.

And Zara Okafor-Mensah loves them fiercely, gratefully, impossibly.

Because they're alive now.

Because that's enough.

Because that's everything.

Five years.

Starting now.

Together.

Always together.

Until they can't be.

And even then, the love remains.

Has to.

It's all there is.

All there ever was.

All that matters.

The portrait proves it.

Five faces.

One moment.

Brief and temporary and absolutely real.

Enough.
