# Chapter 6: Isolation

**POV: Dr. Amara Okafor | Year 1, Day 45 | Antarctic Monitoring Station & Geneva**

---

The conference room held two hundred people. Every seat occupied. Another hundred attending virtually. Screens showing faces from Beijing, Washington, Mumbai, Lagos, Tokyo. Every space-capable nation. Every major research institution. Corporate representatives from the mining consortiums and deep-space infrastructure companies. Everyone who'd ever worked on planetary defense, here or connected, desperate for solutions.

This was Amara's forty-seventh presentation in six weeks.

She stood at the podium, the same data displayed behind her that she'd shown forty-six times before. The asteroid's orbital path. Mass estimates. Velocity vectors. Impact probability. The elegant mathematics of extinction.

"The presentation room in Geneva held three hundred people—UN representatives, space agency directors, corporate executives, military brass. She'd given this briefing forty-seven times now. Forty-seven times explaining the mathematics of their extinction.

"Object 3025-AZ1," she began. Her voice was flat now, clinical. All emotion extracted over dozens of repetitions. "Fifteen-kilometer diameter. Mass one point five times ten to the fifteenth kilograms. Velocity twenty-eight point three kilometers per second. Impact probability ninety-nine point nine seven percent."

The slides changed automatically. Orbital mechanics. Deflection scenarios. Energy calculations."

She clicked through the presentation. Parallax measurements from seven independent observatories. Spectral analysis confirming composition. Rotation period. Albedo. Every detail verified and reverified. The asteroid was real. The mathematics was perfect. The outcome was certain.

"Time to impact," she continued, "is now fourteen years, eleven months, and twenty-nine days."

Fifteen years had become fourteen. Already. Time moving forward with the same indifference as the asteroid.

She showed the deflection scenarios. Every option analyzed, every possibility explored. Kinetic impactor: object too massive. Nuclear deflection: insufficient yield, high fragmentation risk. Gravity tractor: timeline too short. Mass driver: deployment impossible. Every scenario ended the same way: INSUFFICIENT.

"In conclusion," Amara said, reaching the final slide, "no existing deflection technology can alter this object's trajectory. Impact is inevitable. I'm available for questions."

The room erupted. Same as every other presentation. Someone always asked if she was certain. Someone always suggested she'd missed something. Someone always proposed some theoretical scenario that physics made impossible. She answered each question with patience worn thin by repetition.

"Are you absolutely certain?" Chinese delegate, face grave on the screen.

"Yes. Seven independent verifications."

"Could the calculations be wrong?" Russian representative, standing in the back.

"No. The mathematics is straightforward. Multiple teams have confirmed."

"Is there ANY possibility, however small?" Corporate executive, desperation in his voice.

"Below zero point one percent. Effectively impossible."

"That's not zero," someone shouted from the audience.

Amara felt the exhaustion settling into her bones. "Close enough that pursuing it wastes the time we have."

The room erupted again. Arguments. Accusations. Denial dressed as skepticism. The Russian representative stood and walked out. Others followed. Some stayed, pressing for answers that didn't exist.

"We should try anyway," an engineer argued. "Build the kinetic impactor, attempt deflection—"

"With what?" Amara cut him off. "What spacecraft? What launch system? We'd need forty missions carrying payloads we can't build, using technology we don't have, in a timeline that's physically impossible. The math is absolute. We cannot stop this."

"So we should do nothing?" Anger in the voice now.

"I didn't say that. I said we can't deflect it. What humanity does with fifteen years is a different question. Not my expertise."

The Secretary General intervened. "Dr. Okafor has answered these questions forty-seven times. The data stands. This session is concluded." She looked at Amara with something like sympathy. "History will remember you told the truth. That matters."

"Does it?" Amara heard herself say. "Truth doesn't stop asteroids."

"No. But lies won't either."

The conference dissolved. Delegates dispersing, some still arguing, some crying, some blank-faced with shock despite six weeks of knowing. Amara collected her data pad and left through the back exit, avoiding the crowds.

Her hotel room was small and sterile. McMurdo had wanted her to stay in the executive suite—some gesture of honor for the bearer of apocalypse. She'd refused. Didn't want luxury. Wanted isolation. Needed it.

Thirty-seven messages from Zara. Amara scrolled through them without opening. Day 1: "Did you detect it? Are you okay?" Day 3: "Please call." Day 12: "Maya's asking about her aunt." Day 25: "I'm pregnant. Having another baby. I know it's crazy." Day 38: "I need my sister." Day 45: "Please. Just call."

Amara's finger hovered over Zara's contact. Six weeks since detection. Six weeks of silence. What would she say? *Sorry I calculated your children's deaths*? *Sorry I'm famous now for being the bearer of extinction*? *Sorry I can't be the sister you need*?

She closed the messages without responding. Returned to work.

Work was safe. Work was data and calculations and mathematics that didn't ask for emotional connection. She updated the trajectory model, incorporating six weeks of new observations. The asteroid was exactly where the predictions said it would be. Perfect orbital mechanics. Perfect certainty.

Fourteen years, eleven months, twenty-nine days remaining.

Her wrist display chimed. David calling. Her husband. She'd spoken to him twice in six weeks—brief, logistical conversations. "When are you back?" "I don't know." "Okay." That was the extent of their marriage now.

She didn't answer. Let it go to voicemail. Felt guilty but not enough to change behavior. Work needed attention.

The death statistics were updating. Global mortality rates six weeks post-detection. Suicides up 340%. Violence up 280%. Infrastructure failures accelerating as staff abandoned posts. "Natural causes" deaths were down—people weren't dying of old age because they were dying of despair first.

Total deaths in six weeks: forty-three million.

Amara processed this as data. Made graphs. Noted trends. Projected future mortality based on current rates. By Year 15, assuming exponential increase, natural deaths might exceed impact deaths. Humanity killing itself faster than the asteroid would.

She filed the report. Didn't let herself feel it. Couldn't. If she felt forty-three million deaths, she'd break. Better to maintain numbness. Better to stay in the data. Numbers didn't hurt. Statistics didn't demand response. The mathematics was clean even when describing horror.

Two months after detection, Amara returned to Antarctica. The monitoring station felt emptier. Used to be sixty scientists. Now: fifteen. Some quit. Some fled to be with family. Some died—three suicides that Amara knew about. The station was becoming tomb, staffed by the isolated and the devoted in unequal measure.

She settled back into her routine. Graveyard shift. Alone at her workstation. Updating calculations that didn't need updating. The asteroid was exactly where it should be. Every observation confirmed the trajectory. Her presence was unnecessary—automation handled everything. But she showed up anyway. Because what else would she do?

David was home when she arrived. Surprise—she'd expected him to be at the arrays. He was making tea, looking uncomfortable, like he'd been waiting for her.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi."

Silence. Twelve years of marriage reduced to awkward greetings. When had this happened? Amara tried to remember the last time they'd had a real conversation. Months before detection, at least. Maybe longer. They'd been slowly separating for years, too busy to notice until catastrophe made it obvious.

"How was Geneva?" David asked.

"The same. Everyone desperate. Everyone asking if I'm sure. Everyone wanting different answer than physics allows."

"That must be exhausting."

"It is."

More silence. David brought her tea. She accepted it. They stood in their own kitchen like strangers.

"Amara," David started. "Are we okay?"

The question hung between them. Were they okay? No. They were roommates sharing space. Partners in logistics. Married but separate. She couldn't remember the last time they'd touched beyond accident.

"I don't know," she said honestly.

"We used to talk."

"We used to have future tense."

David winced. "We still have fourteen years."

"Do we? Together?" She heard the harshness in her voice but couldn't soften it. "When's the last time we had a conversation that wasn't about schedules?"

"I've been trying—"

"Have you? Because I've been gone six weeks and got two calls."

"You didn't answer most of them."

That was fair. Amara had ignored most calls, most messages, most attempts at connection. Built a wall of work and isolation. Pushed everyone away—David, Zara, colleagues who'd tried to reach out. Easier to be alone. Safer. No demands. No expectations. No emotional vulnerability.

"I'm tired," she said. "I need to sleep."

She went to bed without touching him. Lay in the dark and felt nothing. That was protection. That was survival. Feel nothing, process nothing, exist in the data. It was working. Mostly.

The months continued. Amara presented, calculated, updated, verified. The asteroid approached with perfect precision. Everyone wanting miracles that physics denied. She became famous—"The woman who detected the apocalypse." Hate mail filled her inbox. Death threats. Also gratitude from people who appreciated truth. She read none of it. Just: deleted and moved on.

Zara's messages accumulated. Day 87: "Had my first ultrasound. Baby's healthy." Day 103: "Maya's growing so fast. You're missing it." Day 134: "People are calling me cruel for having another child. I don't care. He matters. They both matter." Day 167: "I wish you'd respond. I miss you."

Amara read them. Couldn't reply. What would she say? She'd become the calculator of death, the scientist who couldn't find solutions. Zara was creating life—defiant, hopeful, present. They were opposites now. No bridge between calculation and creation.

David stopped trying to talk. They existed in parallel—him maintaining solar arrays, her tracking asteroid. Passing in their apartment like ghosts. Marriage dying slowly, neither willing to acknowledge or address it. Easier to ignore. Easier to work. Easier to stay numb.

The monitoring station continued emptying. Fifteen staff became twelve became eight. Dr. Park quit to spend time with grandchildren. Dr. Chen stopped showing up—suicide suspected but not confirmed. The younger researchers fled to family, to travel, to anything but this sterile tomb watching the end approach.

Amara stayed. Updated calculations. Verified trajectories. Counted down days. Fourteen years, eleven months became fourteen years, nine months became fourteen years, six months. Time passing. Asteroid approaching. Everything proceeding according to mathematics.

She stopped leaving the station except to sleep. Spent sixteen hours daily at her workstation. Stopped eating regular meals—just nutrient bars and cold tea. Lost weight. Looked terrible. Didn't care. Work filled the void. Data was companion. Calculations were conversation. She needed nothing else.

Except she was dying too. Not from asteroid. From isolation. From numbness as survival strategy. From choosing data over humanity until humanity atrophied. She knew this intellectually. Couldn't access it emotionally. The numbness was too complete.

Six months after detection, she received a message from someone unexpected: Professor Mei-Lin Wei, Lagos District, philosopher. Amara had never heard of her. The message was simple: "Dr. Okafor, I understand the burden you carry. Being first to know. Being unable to fix. I want you to know: bearing witness matters. Telling truth matters. Not because it changes the asteroid. Because it honors reality. That's valuable even when—especially when—reality is terrible. With respect and compassion, Professor Wei."

Amara read it three times. Didn't respond. But didn't delete it either. Filed it under "Read Later." Returned to work.

The station was empty now except for her and three others. Sixty workstations. Four people. Their footsteps echoed. The facility had been designed for constant activity, vibrant with research and discovery. Now: tomb. Monument to the futility of monitoring what couldn't be stopped.

Amara sat at her workstation at 3:47 AM—same time as detection six months ago. Screen showing the asteroid's position. Trajectory perfect. Impact probability unchanged. Time remaining: fourteen years, five months, fourteen days.

She pulled up Zara's messages. Fifty-three unread. Photos of Maya growing. Videos of Zara's growing belly. Voice messages asking for connection. The life her sister was creating while Amara calculated death.

Her finger hovered over the call button. Six months of silence. Too long. Too much distance. Too much cowardice. She should call. Should be sister. Should be aunt. Should be human.

She closed the messages. Returned to her calculations. Updated the trajectory model. Verified the numbers. Checked the countdown.

Fourteen years, five months, fourteen days.

The isolation was complete. The numbness was protection. The work was everything. And Amara was alone in a tomb, calculating the end of the world, unable to connect with anyone who still lived in it.

Four months after detection. Population in McMurdo District down from 420 million to 350 million. Elena's briefings detailed the exodus—people fleeing to other districts, to other continents, seeking preferred locations for their final years. Infrastructure struggling. Crime rising. Order fraying across the megacity.

Elena still governed. Still showed up daily. Still maintained routines that felt increasingly futile.

Kenji was spiraling. Elena mentioned it in their brief conversations—her son disappearing into parties and substances, seeking oblivion. Amara processed this information clinically. Didn't offer help. Didn't know how. Wasn't capable.

David stopped trying to talk to her. They existed in parallel—same apartment, separate lives. He worked the arrays. She worked the calculations. They passed each other like ghosts, acknowledged but not seen.

Outside, McMurdo District glowed—one among dozens of urban zones, lights merging with neighboring districts into continental sprawl. 420 million people becoming 350 million as the exodus continued. Inside, Amara sat at her workstation and counted down to extinction, one day at a time, alone.

This was her choice. This was her survival. This was how she spent the time remaining: isolated, calculating, numb.

The work continued. The asteroid approached. The loneliness deepened.

And Amara still couldn't call her sister.
