# Chapter 37: Kenji

Year 15. Final weeks. Kenji Torres sits in his mother's empty office with Maya Okafor-Mensah.

She's seventeen. Brilliant. About to die. Asking questions that matter.

"Tell me about Professor Wei," Maya says.

They're surrounded by Elena's abandoned governance—records, files, documents of civilization's last years. Elena doesn't come here anymore. No point. But the space exists. So they use it. For conversation. For teaching. For continuing Wei's work.

"She was 126 when she died," Kenji says. "Lived longer than almost anyone. But still: impermanent. She knew that. Taught it. Embodied it."

"Mama said she taught you to stop seeking. To be present. How did she do that?"

"By being present herself. By refusing to give me answers. I came to her desperate, seeking truth everywhere. She said: the seeking is suffering. Stop seeking. Be here."

"Did you?"

"Eventually. Took years. I kept leaving, kept seeking, kept desperate. But: I came back. Year 10. Stopped seeking. Started being. She died Year 11. But: the teaching continues. Through me. Through your mother. Now: through you."

Maya nods slowly. "She sounds wise."

"She was. And she was ordinary. Just: old woman who lived honestly. Who accepted impermanence. Who taught by being, not preaching."

"I wish I'd met her."

"You're meeting her now. Through me. Through the teaching. She's not gone—just transformed. Present in memory, in lessons, in the people she changed."

"Is that enough? Memory instead of presence?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They sit in Elena's office. Outside: Antarctica failing gracefully. Inside: wisdom transferring across generations. Wei to Kenji to Maya. Teaching continuing despite ending.

"Thank you," Maya says. "For sharing her with me."

"Thank you for listening. For continuing. That's how teachings survive. Not forever. Just: now."

Later, Kenji finds Kofi in the nature preserve.

The boy is watching the penguins—last three. Thirteen years old. Fascinated by everything. Alive despite knowing.

"Kenji!" Kofi says. "Look at them. They don't know, do they?"

"No. They're just being penguins. They don't calculate. Don't worry. Just: exist."

"Is that better? Not knowing?"

Kenji sits beside him. "Wei would say: there's no better or worse. Just: different. They don't know. We do. Both are valid ways of being."

"But if you could choose—knowing or not knowing—which would you pick?"

"Used to think not knowing. Would be easier. But now: I'm grateful I know. Knowing forced me to wake up. To stop seeking. To be present. Without knowing, I might have wasted my whole life desperate."

"You're not desperate now?"

"No. Now I'm here. With you. Watching penguins. In few weeks, we die. But right now: this is real. This is enough."

Kofi considers this. "I've always known. Since I was born. Never knew a world without the asteroid. So for me: this is just how life is. Brief. Precious. Real."

"You're wise. Thirteen years old and already understanding what took me thirty-six years to learn."

"Mama taught me. She said: love anyway. Be present anyway. Make it matter anyway. The asteroid doesn't change that life was always brief."

"Your mother is extraordinary."

"I know. I'm lucky." Kofi pauses. "Are you scared? Of dying?"

Kenji considers honestly. "Sometimes. When I think about it directly. But mostly: no. I'm scared of wasting the time I have. But dying? That's just: what happens. Wei taught me. Everyone dies. I die young, but I die present. That's enough."

"Will it hurt?"

"Probably fast. The asteroid hits, everything ends. Maybe instant. Maybe we see it coming. I don't know. But: we'll be together. Your parents, your sister, me, my mother, everyone. Together until the end."

"That's good. Together is good."

They watch the penguins. Three birds who don't know. Two humans who do. All alive now. All ending soon.

"Thank you for talking to me," Kofi says. "Adults usually don't. They think I'm too young to understand."

"You understand better than most adults. Age doesn't determine wisdom. Presence does."

"Professor Wei taught you that?"

"Professor Wei taught me everything that matters."

They sit together until the penguins disappear into shelter. Then: return to family. To community. To life continuing until it can't.

---

Evening, Kenji walks with his mother.

Elena is sixty-eight years old. Weathered by years of symbolic leadership. Maintaining dignity to the end. Showing up when there's nothing left to show up for.

They walk through McMurdo District. Empty buildings. Failed systems. Two thousand people holding on for weeks.

"I'm proud of you," Kenji says.

"For what? I couldn't stop anything. Couldn't save anyone. Just: witnessed."

"Exactly. You bore witness. Maintained presence. Governed nothing with dignity. That's everything."

"Is it? Really? Or did I waste fifteen years on theater?"

"Not theater. Presence. There's difference. Theater is pretending. Presence is being. You were present. Until the end. That matters."

Elena stops walking. Looks at her son. "When did you become so wise?"

"Professor Wei. She taught me. Then I came home. And you taught me too. Different lessons. Same truth. Presence matters more than outcomes."

"I wish I'd met her."

"You did. Through me. Through her letters. You learned from her. That's meeting."

They continue walking. Mother and son. Healed after years of distance. Present for final weeks.

"Kenji," Elena says. "Do you regret anything? Your life?"

"I regret seeking desperately instead of being present. I wasted seven years desperate. But: I learned. Wei taught me. I came home. I'm here with you now. That's enough."

"I regret not being more present when you were young. After your father died, I hid in work. Like Amara hid. We're similar that way."

"You did what you needed to survive. I don't judge that. And you're here now. We healed. That's what matters."

"Will it be enough? At the end? Will we feel like we lived well?"

"I don't know. But we're trying. We're present. We're loving. What else can we do?"

Elena takes his hand. "Thank you. For coming back. For forgiving me. For being here."

"Thank you for being my mother. For showing me dignity. For letting me go and welcoming me home."

They walk in silence. Two people who hurt each other. Who healed. Who face the end together.

Enough.

Always enough.

---

Days later, Kenji meets Ibrahim.

The former fighter. The faithless believer. The wounded warrior learning to live with uncertainty.

They sit in Ibrahim's apartment. Simple space. Fourth floor. Fifty-three steps. Ibrahim counts them every day. Kenji knows this. Respects this. Paying attention is practice.

"Seven years since you arrived," Kenji says. "Since the wound. Since the faith shattered. How are you?"

"Building something new. Not faith. Not certainty. Just: being here. Learning to accept not knowing."

"Wei would be proud."

"I wish I'd met her. You talk about her like she was saint."

"She wasn't saint. Just: honest. She lived impermanence. Taught it. Died showing us how. That's everything."

Ibrahim nods. "I'm learning the same thing. But harder. I believed in paradise for twenty-seven years. Then: nothing. That absence is heavy."

"Is it better now? Seven years later?"

"Not better. Different. I'm not angry anymore. Not grieving constantly. Just: uncertain. And that's okay. Uncertainty is honest."

"Will you miss faith? When you die?"

Ibrahim considers. "I'll miss the certainty. The comfort. The sense of destination. But: I won't miss the falseness. I believed in something that wasn't there. Now: I don't know what's there. But not knowing is true. Truth matters more than comfort."

"Do you still pray?"

"Sometimes. Habit. Muscle memory. But I know now: the prayer is for me, not God. Way of organizing thoughts. Way of being present. That's okay. Ritual helps even without divine recipient."

"Wei would agree. She practiced rituals. Not religious. Just: attention. Being deliberate. Making moments matter."

"I like that. Making moments matter. That's what I'm learning. Not from God. From people. From you. From Elena. From community."

"That's everything. Community. Connection. People together. Not doctrine. Not certainty. Just: being here together."

Ibrahim smiles. "We're very different, you and me. You sought everywhere and learned to stop. I believed deeply and learned to doubt. But we arrived here. Same place. Same truth."

"Uncertainty is honest."

"Presence is enough."

"Both true."

They sit in comfortable silence. Two men who became brothers. Across cultures, beliefs, journeys. Finding same truth different ways.

"I'm glad you're here," Kenji says. "Glad we're facing this together."

"Me too. I thought I needed faith to face death. Turns out: I needed friends. Community. Presence. That's enough."

"That's everything."

---

Week later, whole community gathers.

Zara's family. Amara and David. Elena. Kenji. Ibrahim. Others—dozen people who stayed, who persisted, who face it together.

Simple meal. Community hall. Last gathering before the end.

Kenji looks around the table. Sees: family. Not blood (mostly). But chosen. Connected by crisis. Bound by presence.

Maya sits beside him. Seventeen. Brilliant. Dying soon. They've talked philosophy for weeks. She understands Wei's teaching. Will carry it for few more days. Then: silence.

But present now. That's everything.

Kofi makes everyone laugh. Thirteen. Alive. Joyful despite knowing. Or maybe: joyful because knowing. Because he learned from Zara: love anyway. Be present anyway. Make it matter.

Amara and Zara—sisters reunited. Healed after years of distance. Different paths. Same destination. Same love.

David and Kwame—steady men. Quiet. Present. Witnessing their wives' courage. Adding their own.

Elena—dignified to the end. Bearing witness. Governing nothing but doing it with grace. His mother. Flawed. Loving. Here.

Ibrahim—faithful then faithless. Certain then uncertain. Fighter then builder. Transformed by crisis into something honest.

All of them. Together. Facing the end.

"I want to say something," Maya announces.

Everyone quiets. Listens. Seventeen-year-old speaking. Final generation.

"I won't have children," Maya says. "I'll never be old. Never finish becoming who I might have been. The asteroid takes all that. But: I existed. I learned. I loved. My parents chose me despite knowing. Professor Wei taught my mother. My mother taught me. Kenji taught me. All of you: witnessed me. That's everything. That's enough. I'm grateful I existed at all."

Silence. Everyone processing. Teenager facing death with more grace than most adults achieve in lifetimes.

Zara cries. Kwame holds her. Amara wipes tears. David steadies everyone.

Kenji speaks: "Wei said: the flower blooms. Brief or long, the blooming matters. You bloomed, Maya. Still blooming. For few more days. That's enough. That's everything."

"Thank you," Maya whispers. "All of you. For witnessing me. For making my brief life matter."

Kofi adds: "Mine too. I'm thirteen. Should be eighty. But: I'm glad I existed. Glad I have you. All of you. That's enough."

The children teaching the adults. Again. Always.

Elena speaks: "I maintained governance for fifteen years. Symbolic only. Theater, maybe. But: I showed up. I bore witness. I said: we were here. We mattered. That's all I could do. I hope it was enough."

"It was," Kenji says. "You were present. Until the end. That's everything."

Ibrahim: "I believed in paradise. I don't anymore. But this moment—being here with you—this is real. This is enough."

Amara: "I hid for ten years. Wasted time. But I'm here now. With family. With David. Witnessing. That has to be enough."

David: "I maintained systems. Solar arrays. Robots. Meaningless work. But: I did it with presence. With love. That made it matter."

Zara: "I chose life. Chose children. Everyone said no. I said yes. Best decision I ever made. They're everything."

Kenji speaks last: "I sought everywhere. Desperate. Empty. Wei taught me: stop seeking. Be present. I learned. Slowly. But: learned. Now I'm here. With you. Accepting what comes. That's enough."

They sit in circle. Nine people. Multiple generations. All witnessing each other. All accepting. All present.

"To Professor Wei," Kenji says, raising cup. "Who taught us. Who showed us. Who lived and died with grace."

"To Wei," everyone echoes.

They drink. They sit. They breathe together.

Few more days. Then: together at the end.

But present now. Loving now. Witnessing now.

Enough.

Always enough.

---

Final night before the end, Kenji sits in his apartment.

Small shrine to Wei. Her photo. Incense. Candles. Memory made physical.

He meditates. Not seeking. Just: being present. Breathing. Existing.

Tomorrow: the asteroid. Tomorrow: everyone dies. Tomorrow: silence.

But tonight: alive. Present. Witnessing.

He thinks of his journey. Fifteen years. From desperate seeker to present witness. From running everywhere to being here. From believing meaning was somewhere else to knowing meaning is only now.

Wei taught him. Through years of patience. Through refusing to give answers. Through embodying presence.

He's grateful. For her teaching. For her dying before the asteroid—showing him individual death before collective death. For her legacy continuing through him, through Zara, through Maya, through anyone who learned.

The flower bloomed.

Still blooming.

One more day.

Then: fade.

But present now.

He opens his eyes. Looks at Wei's photo. She's smiling. Peaceful. Ready at 126.

He's thirty-nine. Not ready. But present. Wei taught him: readiness doesn't matter. Being does.

"Thank you," he whispers to the photo. "For teaching me. For changing me. For showing me how to be."

The candles flicker. The incense burns. Antarctica breathes outside.

Kenji breathes inside.

Present. Accepting. Grateful.

Tomorrow: his mother. Ibrahim. The family. Everyone converging. Facing it together.

He's not scared. Or: he's scared but present anyway. Fear doesn't prevent being. Nothing prevents being except not being.

Simple. True. Enough.

He extinguishes the candles. Lies down. Sleeps his last sleep.

Dreams of Wei in her garden. Gardenia blooming. She smiles. Says nothing. Doesn't need to.

The teaching is complete.

The seeking stopped.

The presence achieved.

One more day.

Then together.

Then—

But present now.

Always present now.

Kenji sleeps.

Antarctica sleeps.

The asteroid approaches.

Forty kilometers per second.

Unstoppable.

Inevitable.

True.

Tomorrow.

But tonight: alive.

Tonight: present.

Tonight: grateful.

Wei's teaching.

Kenji's learning.

Maya's understanding.

All of them.

Blooming.

Brief.

Perfect.

Enough.

The flower bloomed.

That's everything.

Wei was right.

Always was.

Always will be.

For one more day.

Then—

But present now.

Always.

Present.

Now.

Enough.
