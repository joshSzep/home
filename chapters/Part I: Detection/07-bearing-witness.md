# Chapter 7: Bearing Witness

**POV: Mayor Elena Torres | Year 0, Day 60 | Antarctic Megacity**

---

7:00 AM. Morning briefing. Elena's ritual since becoming mayor—elected Year -2 on an infrastructure platform that promised to expand Forever Earth's capacity, to build for millennia.

Her first term ended in eighteen months. Election scheduled for Year 2.

The conference room was designed for fifty department heads. Thirty had attended regularly before detection. Today: five people. Elena. Marcus, her assistant. Chen, infrastructure. Kowalski, security. Dr. Ade, health services.

Everyone else had quit, fled, or died.

Elena sat at the head of the table—her seat, her position, her responsibility. The room felt cavernous now, voices echoing in the empty space. She'd asked facilities to set up a smaller room. Marcus had argued against it: "Shows defeat. We maintain appearances."

So they gathered in this too-large room, five people attempting to govern 3.5 billion, pretending normalcy.

"Population report," Elena said, starting with infrastructure as always. Order. Process. The ritual that had structured her years of governance.

Chen pulled up his data. "Three point one billion as of this morning. Down from four point two billion at detection. Rate of departure slowing but still significant. Projecting two point eight billion by end of year."

Three point one billion. One point one billion gone in sixty days. Fled to other continents, to preferred locations, to anywhere but the ice. Elena didn't blame them. Why stay in Antarctica when you had fifteen years left? Why live at the bottom of the world when the world was ending?

But she stayed. Because someone had to govern. Someone had to maintain order. Someone had to say: we still function, we still care, we still try.

"Infrastructure," Elena prompted.

Chen continued. "Power grid at sixty-eight percent capacity. Not due to damage—due to staffing. Maintenance crews down seventy percent. Water systems at seventy-three percent. Waste management at sixty percent. Transit at forty-five percent. Communications stable—automation handles most of it."

Everything falling. Not catastrophically. Not yet. But the slow degradation of systems that required human attention. People abandoning their posts to spend time with family, to travel, to do anything but maintain infrastructure for a civilization with an expiration date.

Elena made notes. Old habit from before. Documenting everything, planning responses. The notes felt futile but she continued anyway. Someone should document. Someone should record. Even if no one would read them.

"Security," she said.

Kowalski grimaced. "Crime up three hundred and forty percent. Mostly property crimes, some violence. Murder rate up two hundred percent. Enforcement capacity down sixty percent—half the force quit. We're responding to maybe forty percent of calls. Rest go unanswered."

"Recommendations?"

"We need more officers. But no one's joining. Why enforce law when law ends in fourteen years?"

Elena wrote this down. Knew she had no solutions. Couldn't make people care about order when order seemed meaningless. But she documented it anyway.

"Health services," she said, turning to Dr. Ade.

Dr. Ade looked exhausted. "Suicides are our primary concern. Rate has plateaued at three hundred percent above baseline, but that's still... terrible. Medical staff down fifty percent. Hospitals barely functioning. We're triaging based on short-term survival—no long-term treatments, obviously. Birth rate down ninety-four percent. Death rate up six hundred percent. The population decline Chen mentioned? Two-thirds is people leaving. One-third is people dying."

One-third dying. Elena felt that number settle like weight. Three hundred and sixty million deaths across Antarctica in sixty days. More than all the deaths in her years as mayor combined. And this was just beginning.

"Orders, Mayor?" Marcus asked gently, the question he asked every morning.

Elena looked at her notes. Infrastructure failing. Crime rising. Deaths accelerating. People fleeing. Her power was supposed to fix these things. She was mayor. Most powerful human on Earth, governing the planet's largest population concentration. Four billion people—three point one now—under her governance.

And she was completely powerless to help any of them.

"Same as yesterday," she said. Her voice was steady, practiced. "Maintain what we can. Document what we can't. Continue essential services as long as staffing allows. Chen, redistribute power resources to critical systems first. Kowalski, focus enforcement on preventing violence. Dr. Ade, prioritize suicide prevention and mental health. We keep functioning. That's the goal."

"That's all?" Kowalski asked, frustration in his voice.

Elena met his eyes. "That's everything."

The briefing concluded. Five people dispersing to attempt the impossible—governing a city losing its population and its purpose. Marcus stayed behind as always.

"Elena," he said. First name. He did that when they were alone. "Why are we doing this?"

She'd wondered when he'd ask. Marcus was thirty-two, brilliant, dedicated. He'd been her assistant for six years. Could have left. Could have spent fifteen years anywhere. But he stayed. Showed up every morning. Took notes. Managed schedules. Governed a dying city beside her.

"I don't know," she admitted. "Why are you still here, Marcus?"

"Because you are."

"That's not a reason."

"Isn't it? You're my mayor. You're... you matter. Someone should witness you witnessing all of this."

Elena felt unexpected tears. Blinked them back. Professional mask. Can't cry in front of staff, even staff of one who'd become something like family.

"I don't know why I'm doing this," she said quietly. "Maintaining government when government ends in fourteen years. Holding briefings that don't matter. Documenting collapse for archives no one will read. It's theater. Meaningless theater."

"Is it meaningless?" Marcus pulled up his tablet. "Look. Last week you redistributed power to hospitals. Saved four thousand lives—four thousand people who'd have died in darkness. Yesterday you authorized emergency housing for climate refugees. Gave a hundred and twenty thousand people shelter. This morning you'll sign the food distribution update. Keeps three billion people fed for another week. Meaningless?"

"They're all going to die anyway."

"So are you. So am I. Does that make today meaningless?"

The question sat between them. Elena had been asking herself the same thing for sixty days. If nothing lasted, if everything ended, if all her governance dissolved in asteroid impact—did it matter? Did the work matter? Did her presence matter?

"I think it does," Marcus said when she didn't answer. "Not because it changes the ending. Because it honors the middle. You govern with dignity. You maintain order. You care. That matters even if—especially if—it doesn't last."

Elena stared at her assistant, this thirty-two-year-old who understood something she was still grasping toward. "You sound like a philosopher."

"I've been reading Professor Wei's letters. The ones she sends you."

"I didn't know you read those."

"You leave them on your desk. I may have... absorbed them." Marcus smiled slightly. "She writes about presence. About bearing witness. About how maintenance is practice even when—especially when—outcome is certain. Made me think differently about our work."

Elena had been receiving Wei's letters for three weeks. Simple philosophical observations from a woman she'd never met. The first letter had appeared in her inbox subject: "To the Mayor Who Governs the Ending." Elena almost deleted it. But something made her read it.

*Mayor Torres, I understand the burden you carry. Responsibility without agency. Power without ability to save. You maintain order knowing order ends. This seems futile. But: what if governance is its own purpose? Not for outcome. For process. You show up. You hold briefings. You maintain dignity. That's not theater—that's practice. Practice of presence. Practice of care. Practice of continuing even when continuation seems meaningless. This is valuable. This is beautiful. Even if no one sees. Even if nothing changes. The practice itself is the point. With respect, Professor Mei-Lin Wei.*

Elena had read it five times. Didn't respond. But she'd read every subsequent letter. Wei wrote weekly—short observations, philosophical reflections, gentle reminders that presence mattered regardless of duration. The letters helped. Elena didn't know why. Maybe because Wei seemed to understand the paradox Elena lived: maintaining what would end, caring despite futility, showing up when showing up seemed meaningless.

"Wei writes that bearing witness is purpose itself," Elena said to Marcus. "Not for outcome. Just: being present. Seeing clearly. Documenting accurately. That's enough."

"Is it enough for you?"

Elena considered this. Was it enough to govern knowing governance ended? To hold briefings for five people when thirty used to attend? To document collapse no one would read? Was the practice itself sufficient?

"I don't know yet," she admitted. "But it's what I have. So I continue."

Her office was quiet after Marcus left. Elena sat at her desk, looking at the megacity through her window. The Antarctic sprawl extending to the horizon—billions of lives, endless lights, all temporary now. She'd fought for this position. Three campaigns. Lost twice, won the third two years ago. Governed with competence since then. Built infrastructure, managed growth, maintained stability across the world's largest city. Wanted to leave legacy.

Now legacy was impossible. In fifteen years, everything—Antarctica, Earth—would be reduced to molten rock and ash. Her governance would vanish. Her policies would mean nothing. The infrastructure she'd built would vaporize.

There would be no legacy. The asteroid would erase everything. Her governance, her efforts, her years of work—all rendered meaningless by physics.

Unless... unless the work mattered for itself. Not for outcome. Not for legacy. Just: for the doing. She governed because governance was her practice. Because showing up mattered. Because maintaining dignity in collapse was its own purpose.

Maybe.

She pulled up the housing authorization Marcus mentioned. Twelve hundred refugees needing shelter. Simple approval process. She signed it. Twelve hundred people would have housing today. Not forever. Just: today. Was that enough? It had to be. It was all anyone ever had.

The comm chimed. Her son's name appeared. Kenji. She'd spoken to him twice since detection, both conversations brief and strained. He'd looked terrible—thin, hollow-eyed, clearly not sleeping. Rumors reached her: parties, substances, self-destruction. She'd wanted to help. Didn't know how. He didn't answer her calls anymore.

She answered immediately. "Kenji? Mijo?"

His face appeared on screen. Looked worse than last time. Unshaven. Glassy-eyed. Background was dark, unfamiliar. Some apartment, some party maybe.

"Mom." His voice was slurred slightly. "Hi."

"Are you okay?"

"Fine." Obviously not fine. Obviously using. Obviously dying slowly while everyone died slowly together. "Just wanted to... I don't know. Say hi."

"Where are you?"

"Friend's place. Or... someone's place. Don't remember." He laughed, bitter and wrong. "Does it matter?"

"It matters to me."

"Why? Why does anything matter?" His voice rising, agitated. "You're governing a dead city. I'm destroying myself slowly. Maya's growing up to die at seventeen. Everyone's pretending their actions matter when nothing matters. Why pretend?"

Elena felt her heart breaking. Her brilliant son, her PhD candidate, reduced to this. "Mijo, please come home. Let me help."

"Help how? Make the asteroid disappear? Give me future back? Fix meaninglessness?" Kenji's laugh was ugly. "You're the most powerful human on Earth, Mom. You can't fix this. No one can."

"I know. But I can be here. I can be your mother. That's not nothing."

"Isn't it? You'll be my mother for fourteen more years, then: physics. Then: nothing. Then it won't matter if you were good mother or terrible mother because I'll be dead and you'll be dead and everyone's relationships will be vaporized."

"Does that make them meaningless right now?"

The question stopped him. He stared at her through the screen, glassy eyes trying to focus.

"I don't know," he said finally, voice small. "I don't know anything anymore."

"Then come home. We'll not-know together."

"I can't." He ended the call.

Elena sat in her office, staring at the blank screen. Her son was destroying himself. She was powerless to stop it. Add that to the list of things her power couldn't affect: asteroid, exodus, deaths, her own child's spiral.

She pulled up Wei's most recent letter. Read it again.

*Mayor Torres, you asked in your last message if powerlessness means meaninglessness. I think not. You're confusing outcome with action. You cannot control outcome. Never could. Asteroid makes this visible, but was always true. What you control: action. Presence. Choice. Today, you chose to show up. To govern. To care. Tomorrow, you'll choose again. String of choices, day by day, until no more days. That's not powerless. That's practice. The practice is the power. Outcome is irrelevant. With respect, Professor Wei.*

Elena had responded to that letter. First time writing back. Brief message: *Professor Wei, thank you. Your letters help. I don't understand fully yet, but I'm beginning to see. Governance as practice. Presence as purpose. Continuing even when continuation seems futile. I'm trying. Mayor Elena Torres.*

Wei had responded within a day: *Mayor Torres, you understand more than you think. Keep showing up. Keep practicing. That's all any of us can do. Even me, old woman watering garden that will burn. We tend what's here. We're present to what is. Together, separately, we practice. That's enough. That's everything. With compassion, Wei.*

Elena stood, moved to the window. The Antarctic megacity stretched below. Three point one billion people. Her responsibility. Her practice. Her purpose—not because she could save them, but because she could witness them. Could govern with dignity. Could show up daily and say: you matter. Today, you matter.

Tomorrow: same choice. And the day after. Fourteen years of tomorrows, each one practiced with presence.

She pulled up her schedule. Morning briefing complete. Next: budget review. Then: infrastructure meeting. Then: health crisis response. Then: evening address to the continent. And somewhere in the back of her mind: election planning. Eighteen months until voters decided whether a mayor mattered anymore. Whether governance itself had purpose.

Political opposition was forming. She'd heard whispers—Marcus Rivera, an infrastructure specialist, pragmatist voices asking "what's the point?" Some calling for her resignation outright. Part of her wondered if they were right. What was the point of a mayor when everyone died anyway?

But another part—the part that showed up every morning, that held briefings for five people, that signed housing permits and power allocations—that part understood. The point wasn't saving anyone. The point was bearing witness. Someone should say: dignity mattered until the end. That's what she'd defend in eighteen months. Not power. Not solutions. Just: presence. Just: showing up.

All of it theater, maybe. All of it meaningless, possibly. All of it practice, certainly.

She'd keep doing it. Because what else was there? She was Mayor Elena Torres. This was her function. These were her people. Outcome was beyond her control. But action—action was hers. Today's action. This moment's governance.

That had to be enough.

It was all anyone had.

She returned to her desk and pulled up the budget review. Numbers that didn't matter for future that wouldn't exist. But today, the numbers mattered. Today, the work continued. Today, she governed.

Tomorrow: same choice. Same practice. Same presence.

Fourteen years of todays.

That was governance now. That was power. That was purpose.

She authorized the hospital power allocation. Signed the housing permits. Approved the food distribution. Each document a small act of governance. Each signature saying: today matters. Today, I care. Today, I'm present.

Marcus knocked, entered. "Next meeting in ten."

"Thank you." Elena saved her work, stood, prepared. Another meeting. Another decision. Another moment of bearing witness.

Elena Torres, Mayor of Antarctica, bearing witness to the end of the world, one briefing at a time.

Fourteen years left. She'd spend them showing up.
