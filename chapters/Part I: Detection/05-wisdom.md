# Chapter 5: Wisdom

**POV: Professor Mei-Lin Wei | Year 1, Day 2 | Lagos District**

---

The gardenia bloomed despite the season. Late autumn, and here was this rebellious flower opening its white petals to the manufactured warmth of Lagos District. Professor Mei-Lin Wei touched the bloom gently—soft as paper, fragrant as memory. The scent reminded her of her grandmother's garden in Beijing, seventy years ago. Different flowers, same beauty. Everything changed. Everything stayed the same.

Wei's balcony garden was modest—ten square meters of carefully tended life. Native flowers adapted to the engineered tropical climate. Vegetables growing in raised beds. A small lemon tree she'd transported from Beijing ten years ago when she'd finally retired and moved here. Everything impermanent. Everything returning to soil eventually. She'd maintained this garden as meditation, as practice, as daily reminder of life's temporary nature.

She was 114 years old. Her body reminded her of this constantly—knees complaining with each movement, back aching in the morning, hands shaking enough that watering required concentration. She moved carefully, cane in left hand, watering can in right. Each step deliberate. Life extension medicine was common now, but not miraculous. Bodies still aged. Cells still degraded. Death still arrived, just delayed. Wei's doctors said she might reach 125 if she was lucky. She wasn't sure luck was the right word for extended aging.

But her mind remained sharp. That's what mattered. Seventy years teaching philosophy. Forty years practicing Buddhist meditation—not religious Buddhism with rebirth and deities, but philosophical Buddhism, the observation of impermanence and suffering and the nature of consciousness. Lifetime spent preparing for death. Not fearfully. Curiously. Death was the one certainty. Everything else was speculation.

The watering complete, Wei lowered herself carefully onto her garden bench. The morning was bright and warm. Lagos District waking up below—five million people beginning another day. She could see the district's green zone from here, the engineered parks and waterways that made this manufactured city feel alive. Humans were good at making homes. Even in deserts, even at poles, even after climate catastrophe forced migrations. The adaptability was admirable. The attachment to permanence was the problem.

Her house system chimed. Emergency alert. The whole building lighting up. Wei set down the watering can carefully. Stood slowly. Walked inside, where her screen was displaying the blue banner of UN Security Council override.

She read the alert. Extinction-level asteroid. Fifteen years. Cannot be deflected.

Read it twice, making sure she understood. The English was clear. The meaning unambiguous. Near-Earth object, ten to fifteen kilometers diameter, 99.97% impact probability. Time to impact: 15 years, 2 months, 14 days. All deflection scenarios insufficient.

Everyone dies.

Wei turned off the screen. Returned to her garden. Picked up the watering can. The gardenias still needed water. Alert or no alert, asteroid or no asteroid, the plants needed tending. She continued her morning routine.

This was philosophy made concrete. The asteroid didn't change the present moment. It didn't change what needed doing. The gardenias were thirsty. She would water them. That's what presence meant—attending to what was here, now, regardless of what was coming.

She'd been practicing this for forty years. Now it was test.

The lemon tree needed water too. She watered it carefully, making sure the soil absorbed rather than ran off. This tree was fifty years old. She'd grown it from seed in Beijing. Transported it through three moves. It had survived climate shifts, political upheaval, her own aging. In fifteen years, it would burn in the impact. But today, it needed water. So she watered it.

Movement at her door. Wei turned, saw Zara bursting onto the balcony. Zara Okafor-Mensah, her neighbor and friend. Maya on her hip, both crying. Zara's face was red and panicked.

"Professor Wei!" Zara's voice was rising toward hysteria. "An asteroid! Fifteen years! Everyone dies!"

Wei set down the watering can. Gestured to the garden bench. "Sit."

"Did you hear? An asteroid! It's going to hit!" Zara wasn't sitting, was pacing, agitated. Maya crying harder, scared by her mother's fear. "My daughter will die! She's two! She'll be seventeen! Never eighteen, never—" Her voice broke. She collapsed onto the bench, sobbing. Maya sobbing too, not understanding but caught in the grief.

Wei sat beside them. Didn't touch yet. Just: present. Grief needed space to move before wisdom could enter. She'd learned this teaching philosophy students for seventy years. You couldn't rush past emotion to understanding. The emotion had to be felt first.

Zara cried for several minutes. Maya gradually calming, thumb in mouth, leaning against her mother. Wei sat patiently. The garden was quiet except for the sounds of grief. The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree stood still. Everything continuing despite the sorrow.

Eventually, Zara's sobs quieted. She wiped her face roughly. "How are you so calm? Did you not hear? Everyone dies!"

"I heard," Wei said gently.

"Then how are you sitting here watering plants?"

"The plants are thirsty. Should I let them die today because they'll die in fifteen years?"

Zara stared at her. "That's not the same thing."

"Isn't it? The plants were always going to die. This season, next season, the season after. Impermanence was always there. The asteroid just makes the timeline visible."

"My daughter!" Zara's voice rose again. "She's two! She'll be seventeen! She'll never grow up, never—"

"Was she not always going to die?" Wei asked quietly.

The question stopped Zara mid-sentence. "What?"

"Was Maya not always temporary? Was her life not always going to end?" Wei gestured to the gardenias. "This flower bloomed yesterday. Tomorrow, it will start browning. Three days from now, fallen. Two weeks from now, just memory. Same cycle every year. Every gardenia blooms and dies. The asteroid doesn't change the flower's nature. Just makes us pay attention."

"You're comparing my daughter to a flower?"

"I'm comparing all of us to flowers. Temporary. Beautiful. Here for brief moment, then gone. That was always true. Most people pretend otherwise. The asteroid ends the pretending."

Zara was quiet, processing. Maya had stopped crying, was looking at the gardenias with interest. Wei pointed to the white bloom. "See the flower, Maya?"

Maya nodded, thumb still in mouth.

"Beautiful, yes?"

Another nod.

"Tomorrow, less beautiful. Day after, falling. But today—" Wei touched the bloom gently. "Today, perfect. That's all flowers get. Today. Right now. This moment of blooming."

"She's two," Zara whispered. "She doesn't understand."

"She understands more than you think. Children are closer to the truth. They live in the moment naturally. We teach them to plan, to project, to imagine permanence. But originally, they knew. This moment. This moment. This moment. That's all anyone has ever had."

Zara was crying again, but quieter. Not hysteria now. Just: grief. "Fifteen years. It's not enough."

"No," Wei agreed. "It's not. But was seventy years enough? Eighty? A hundred? I'm 114. Is that enough? Would 125 be? Would a thousand?" She was quiet for a moment. "Nothing is ever enough if we think it should be permanent. But if we accept impermanence—really accept it—then every moment becomes enough. Not in the sense of satisfying. In the sense of complete."

"I can't—" Zara shook her head. "I can't think that way."

"No one can, immediately. It's practice. Daily practice for years. I've been preparing for death my entire adult life. This news is shocking. But the truth it reveals? That was always there."

Maya squirmed down from Zara's lap, toddled over to the gardenias. Reached out with small fingers. "Pretty!"

"Gentle," Zara said automatically. Maya touched the bloom carefully, delicately. Wei watched the two-year-old examine the flower with complete focus. That was presence. That was what everyone needed to relearn.

"Come to my garden every day," Wei said to Zara. "Bring Maya. Watch the flowers bloom and die. Watch the lemon tree fruit and rest. Practice seeing impermanence. Practice being present anyway. Won't make the asteroid disappear. But might make fifteen years richer than most people's eighty."

"Will you teach me?" Zara's voice was small, hopeful.

"I will teach you nothing," Wei said. "But I will sit with you while you learn."

Zara managed a weak smile. "Is that Buddhist philosophy?"

"That's gardening philosophy. Same thing, really." Wei stood slowly, her body reminding her it was 114 years old. "Go home. Hold your daughter. Make breakfast. Do the things that need doing today. Tomorrow, come back. Every day. We'll sit together. Watch life being temporary. That's the practice."

"What if I can't do it? What if I panic?"

"Then panic. Then come to the garden anyway. Panic and practice aren't opposites. Panic is feeling. Practice is action. Do both."

Zara collected Maya, who protested leaving the flowers. "Tomorrow, baby. We'll come back tomorrow."

"Garden!" Maya demanded.

"Yes, the garden. Professor Wei's garden."

They left. Wei sat on her bench, listening to their footsteps fade. The balcony was quiet again. The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree stood patient. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything here now.

She thought about the asteroid. Fifteen years. 5,478 days. Give or take. It was quite a lot of time, actually. More than many people got. Her own father had died at forty-seven. Her husband at sixty-three. So many students lost to illness, accident, violence over the decades. Fifteen years was generous by comparison.

Not that generosity made sense applied to physics. The asteroid wasn't giving humanity anything. It was just: matter, following trajectory, approaching planet. Indifferent. Like everything in the universe. Like death itself. Not malicious. Not kind. Just: eventual.

She'd accepted her own death decades ago. Practiced it daily. Sat with the understanding that this body would fail, this consciousness would cease, this "Wei" would dissolve like morning mist. Buddhism called it *anatta*—no-self. The understanding that what we call "I" is temporary construction, no more permanent than a wave on water.

The asteroid made this collective. Everyone dying together. In a way, that was mercy. No one left behind to grieve. No lingering in a world emptied of loved ones. Just: everyone together, until together stopped meaning anything.

Her body would likely fail before the asteroid arrived. She was 114. Fifteen years meant 129. Possible but unlikely. She'd probably die naturally. Disease or organ failure or simply age. The body was breaking down already. Everything complained. Death was close even without the asteroid.

But for Zara, for Maya, for the young ones—this was tragedy. Maya at seventeen. Zara at forty-nine. Kenji Torres, Elena's son, whom Wei had never met but heard about—he'd be thirty-nine. All cut off mid-life. All denied the full span.

Was that worse than dying at eighty? Wei wasn't sure. Length of life and quality of life weren't the same. She'd known people who lived ninety years in quiet desperation. Others who died at thirty having fully lived. Maybe the asteroid was invitation. Not to give up. To be present. To stop deferring life to imagined future and live now.

That's what she'd teach, if people came to learn. Not comfort. Not false hope. Just: presence. Attention. Being here fully because here is all anyone ever has.

The morning was advancing. Lagos District fully awake now. Wei could hear agitation in the distance—voices raised, sirens, the sound of disruption. People reacting. People panicking. People trying to process the unprocessable. All of it normal. All of it necessary. The grief would move through at its own pace.

She returned to her watering. A few plants still dry. Her body protested the movement, but she ignored it. Body always protested. That's what 114 years meant. But the work remained. The plants needed tending. That was enough.

When the watering was complete, she sat again. Pulled out her writing materials—old-fashioned paper and pen, not screens. She'd been writing a book for twenty years. Reflections on philosophy, practice, teaching. Never finished it. Maybe never would. Did that matter? The writing itself was the practice. Completion was attachment.

But now, with fifteen years defined, maybe she'd finish. Maybe the deadline would help. Ironic. Asteroid as writing deadline.

She wrote for an hour. About impermanence. About presence. About how the asteroid revealed what was always true. About the gardenia blooming and dying, indifferent to observation. About how humans made meaning in meaningless universe, and how that was both futile and necessary.

The words flowed easily. Seventy years of teaching clarified thought. She knew what she understood. Knew what she didn't. Knew the difference between wisdom and pretense.

By noon, she was tired. 114 years old. Everything exhausted her eventually. She put away the writing. Made tea. Sat in her garden with the cup warm in shaking hands.

The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree stood patient. The sun moved across the sky, indifferent and regular. Everything continuing. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful.

Fifteen years left. That was quite a lot of time.

She'd water the garden tomorrow. And the day after. And every day until she couldn't anymore. The practice didn't change. The asteroid didn't matter. What mattered was now. This moment. This tea. This warmth. This breath.

That was wisdom. Not profound. Not special. Just: attention to what was actually here.

The rest was story. Narrative about future and past. Important stories, maybe. But still: stories. The gardenia didn't need stories. It just bloomed.

Wei sipped her tea and watched her garden grow.

Fifteen years until extinction.

But right now, the flowers were beautiful.

And right now was all there ever was.
