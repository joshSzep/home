# Chapter 35: Zara

Year 15. Final months. Lagos to Antarctica.

Zara Okafor-Mensah stands on the deck of the transport ship with her family—Kwame beside her, Maya (seventeen) at the rail, Kofi (thirteen) exploring every corner.

Behind them: Lagos. The city disappearing into haze. Home. History. Everything that shaped them.

Ahead: Antarctica. The megacity. Amara. Family. Final gathering.

Three months until the asteroid. Twelve weeks until impact. Ninety days until everyone dies together.

Zara holds Kwame's hand. They've been married nineteen years. Made it through detection, crisis, two children, Wei's death, endless grief and joy tangled together. Still choosing each other. Still here.

"Are we doing the right thing?" Kwame asks quietly.

"Leaving Lagos? Going to Amara? Yes. We need family. The children need to meet their aunt. We need to face this together."

"I mean: everything. Having them. Raising them. Bringing them to the end."

Zara looks at Maya and Kofi. Her children. Her defiant choice. Her best work.

"Yes," she says firmly. "Every second. Every choice. Yes."

Kwame nods. They watch Lagos fade. The ship moves south. Journey beginning.

Final journey.

Only journey that matters now.

---

The voyage takes three weeks.

Transport ship barely functioning. Ancient vessel, pre-Forever Earth, maintained by crew who know it's the last run. Everything's the last now. Last voyage. Last maintenance. Last everything.

But: it moves. Slowly. South through failing oceans.

Maya spends hours at the rail. Watching water. She's seventeen—brilliant, beautiful, mature beyond her years because circumstances demanded it. She'll never be eighteen. Never finish growing. Never have the life Zara dreamed for her.

But: she's here. She exists. That's everything.

"Mama," Maya says one evening. "Tell me about Aunt Amara."

Zara joins her at the rail. "What do you want to know?"

"Why did she disappear? After detection? Why did she stop calling?"

"She was scared. Hiding. She thought isolation would protect her from pain. It didn't—just delayed it."

"Are you angry at her?"

"I was. For years. But Wei taught me about impermanence, about accepting what is. Amara did what she needed to survive. Now she's ready to be sisters again. That's what matters."

"Do you think she'll like us?"

"She'll love you. How could she not? You're extraordinary."

Maya smiles—small, sad. "I won't have children. My line ends with me."

"I know, baby."

"Are you sorry? That you had us? Knowing we'd die young?"

This question again. Maya asks it every few years. Different ages. Different contexts. Same terror underneath: did I matter?

"No," Zara says firmly. "Never. Not once. You and Kofi are the best thing I ever did. You made my life matter. I made yours matter. That's enough."

"Even though it's brief?"

"Especially because it's brief. Everything's brief. The asteroid just makes it visible. But love is real. You're real. That's everything."

Maya leans against her. Seventeen years old. Three months left. Beautiful and doomed and here.

"Thank you," Maya whispers. "For having me anyway."

"Thank you for being you."

They stand at the rail as the ship moves south. Mother and daughter. Watching the world pass. Counting down together.

---

Kofi makes friends with everyone.

The crew. Other passengers. Even the ship's cat—ancient, scarred, persistent. Thirteen years old, playful despite knowing. Or maybe: playful because knowing.

Zara watches him charm his way through the ship and feels overwhelming love. He's bright, curious, alive. Never knew a world before the asteroid. Accepts ending more easily because it's all he's ever known.

"Papa," Kofi says one evening. "Will Antarctica have penguins?"

"Some," Kwame answers. "Not many left. But some."

"Can I see them?"

"Yes. We'll find them. You'll love it there—all that ice, all that space. Different from Lagos."

"Will I like Aunt Amara?"

"I think so. Your mama loves her. That's enough recommendation."

"What about Uncle David?"

"He's quiet. Works with robots and solar arrays. But kind. You'll like him."

Kofi processes this. "How long do we have? There?"

Kwame and Zara exchange glances. They've never hidden the truth. But saying it hurts every time.

"Three months," Zara says. "Twelve weeks. Enough time to see everything. Meet everyone. Be together."

"Then we die."

"Then we die. Together. All of us."

"I'm not scared," Kofi says. "I'm with you."

Zara pulls him close. Thirteen years old. Three months left. Should have decades. Has weeks.

"We're with you too," she says. "Always. Until the end. Then: still together."

Kofi nods against her. They sit as the ship moves south. Family holding each other. Counting down.

---

Week two, storm hits.

Violent. Unexpected. Ship rocks dangerously. Crew scrambling. Passengers terrified.

Zara gathers her family in their cabin. Holds Maya and Kofi. Kwame holds all of them.

"Together," Zara says. "We're together. That's what matters."

The storm rages. Ship groans. Water breaches lower decks.

For hours, they think: this is it. We die now. Not asteroid. Storm. Different ending. Wrong ending.

But: the ship holds. The crew succeeds. The storm passes.

Dawn breaks. Battered ship continues south.

Afterward, Maya says: "I thought we'd die. Apart from Aunt Amara. Apart from everyone."

"We didn't. We're still here."

"But we could have. The asteroid isn't the only danger. Everything's dangerous now."

"It always was," Zara says gently. "Life was always fragile. The asteroid just makes it visible. But we survived the storm. We're continuing. That's everything."

Kofi says: "When we die—in three months—will it hurt?"

"I don't know, baby. Probably fast. Hopefully fast."

"Will we know it's happening?"

"Maybe. Maybe not. But we'll be together. Holding each other. That's what matters."

The family sits in their cabin. Survivors of storm. Moving toward ending. Choosing presence despite fear.

Wei taught this. Zara lives it. Now her children learn it.

Impermanence. Fragility. Being present anyway.

The ship continues south.

---

Week three. Antarctica appears on horizon.

White. Vast. Impossible. The megacity rising from ice—testament to human ambition, human engineering, human belief that forever was possible.

Forever lasted fifty years. Then: fifteen more. Then: done.

But present now. Real now. Beautiful now.

Maya gasps. "It's huge."

"They built it to last ten thousand years," Zara says. "It lasted fifty. Then this."

"Was it worth building? If it doesn't last?"

"The building was real. The people who built it were real. The attempt mattered. Yes. Worth it."

Kofi presses against the rail. "There are so many buildings."

"Two thousand people still live here. Used to be fifteen thousand. Now: concentrated. Surviving together."

The ship moves toward dock. McMurdo District growing larger. Ice and architecture and human persistence.

Zara's heart pounds. Amara. After all these years. After all the distance. Sisters finally. Finally.

"Ready?" Kwame asks.

"No. But going anyway."

They gather their few belongings. Prepare to disembark. Family of four. Final journey. Final destination.

Together.

Always together.

---

The dock is small. Frozen. Few people waiting.

And there—standing alone, wrapped in thermal coat, face weathered by years and grief and work: Amara.

Zara sees her sister and everything breaks open.

They run to each other. Awkward on ice. Crying before they even touch. Embrace desperately.

"I'm sorry," Amara says. "I'm so sorry. I wasted so much time."

"You're here now. That's enough."

"I missed you. I missed everything. I was so scared and I hid and I'm sorry."

"I'm here. We're here. Look—"

Zara pulls back. Gestures to her family. Kwame approaching cautiously. Maya and Kofi hanging back, uncertain.

"This is Kwame. My husband. And Maya. And Kofi. Your family."

Amara looks at them. Really looks. Sees niece and nephew for first time. Seventeen and thirteen. Beautiful. Doomed. Here.

"Hi," Maya says softly. "I'm Maya. I'm so glad to finally meet you."

"I'm Kofi. Do you have penguins?"

Amara laughs—surprised by joy through tears. "Some. Yes. I'll show you."

She pulls Maya into a hug. Then Kofi. Then Kwame. Gathering them all. Family. Finally complete.

Behind Amara: a man. Tall, quiet, kind-faced. David.

"This is David," Amara says. "My... husband. Partner. Everything."

David nods to Zara. "Thank you for coming. She needed you. We all need each other now."

"Thank you for having us," Zara says.

They stand on the dock—six people. Two sisters. Two husbands. Two children. Family converged. Facing ending together.

"Come," Amara says. "It's freezing. Let's go home."

Home. Antarctica. Megacity. Final place. Final home.

They walk from the docks through McMurdo—small district, failing infrastructure, determined people. To the house Amara and David share. Small. Warm. Enough.

Inside, they sit together. Shed coats. Accept tea.

Amara can't stop looking at Maya and Kofi. "They're beautiful."

"They are," Zara agrees.

"I missed their whole lives."

"You're here for the end. That counts."

"Does it?"

"Has to."

Maya asks: "Aunt Amara, what do you do? Mama says you're a scientist."

"I study the asteroid. Track it. Predict impact. I've been watching it for fifteen years."

"Does that help? Knowing exactly when?"

"Not help. But: someone should witness. Someone should document. That's what I do."

"Professor Wei said witnessing matters," Maya says. "Even if it doesn't change anything. Just: bearing witness is enough."

Amara glances at Zara. "Professor Wei?"

"Our neighbor in Lagos. Philosopher. 126 years old. Died three years ago. She taught us about impermanence. About being present. About accepting what is."

"I would have liked to meet her."

"She would have liked you. She said witnessing is holy work. That's what you've been doing."

Amara nods slowly. "Maybe. I thought I was hiding. But maybe: witnessing too."

Kofi explores the house. Touches everything. Maya asks about solar arrays, climate systems, megacity engineering. Kwame and David talk quietly. Amara and Zara just: look at each other. Sisters. Finally. After everything.

"I'm glad you're here," Amara whispers.

"Me too. Me too."

---

That night, after children sleep, sisters sit alone.

Small living room. Tea. Fifteen years of distance to process.

"Tell me about them," Amara says. "Maya and Kofi. Tell me everything."

So Zara tells her. Maya's birth right after detection—terror and joy tangled. Kofi's birth Year 1—defiant choice. Growing up knowing. Being honest. Teaching them love, presence, courage. Wei's influence. Kwame's steadiness. The choice every day to love fiercely despite knowing.

"You're so brave," Amara says. "I couldn't do it. I hid. You lived."

"You're here now. Working. Witnessing. That's brave too."

"I wasted ten years. Withdrew from you. From David. From everyone."

"But you came back. Reconnected. Invited us here. That's everything."

Amara cries. "I missed their whole childhoods. I'll never get that back."

"No. But you get three months. That's real. That's something."

"Is it enough?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They sit in comfortable silence. Sisters who took different paths. Both arriving here. Both present now.

"Thank you for coming," Amara says. "For bringing them. For forgiving me."

"Nothing to forgive. You did what you needed to survive. I did what I needed. Now we're together. That's what matters."

"Three months."

"Three months. With family. Facing it together."

Amara nods. "I'm glad you're here."

"Me too."

They sit until dawn. Catching up. Grieving together. Loving fiercely. Sisters to the end.

---

Next morning, Amara shows them the megacity.

All six together. Walking through McMurdo District. Maya and Kofi amazed—they've only known Lagos, coastal chaos, tropical heat. This: ice, order, architecture of ambition.

"They built this thinking it would last forever," Amara says. "Ten thousand years. Civilization's southern anchor."

"How long did it last?" Maya asks.

"Fifty years before the asteroid. Fifteen years after. Sixty-five total. Not forever. But: real. Beautiful. Attempt that mattered."

They visit the nature preserve—artificial ecosystem maintaining Earth species. Kofi sees penguins—three of them, last survivors. He's entranced.

"They don't know," Kofi says. "Do they? About the asteroid?"

"No," Amara says. "They're just being penguins. Someone has to care for them until the end. That someone is us."

"That's sad."

"That's kind. Witnessing their being. Honoring it. Even if it ends."

Maya asks about solar arrays. Amara takes them to the platforms—two hundred meters up, David's life work. He shows Maya the systems. She understands immediately—brilliant like her mother, curious like her father.

"These will function until impact?" Maya asks.

"Yes," David says. "Maybe few seconds longer. They don't know they're dying. They'll just: work. Until they can't."

"Is that comforting?"

"Sometimes. They do their job. I do mine. We persist together."

Kofi climbs on the lower platforms—supervised, careful. He laughs. Joy in present moment. Thirteen years old. Three months left. Still playing.

Zara watches him and feels everything at once. Grief. Love. Gratitude. Terror. Acceptance.

Wei taught her: feel it all. Don't choose. Just: be present with everything.

So she is.

Present with her son playing. Her daughter learning. Her sister witnessing. Her husband steadying everyone. Her extended family gathering for the end.

All of it. All true. All enough.

---

That evening, they meet Elena and Kenji.

The mayor and her son. Still bearing witness. Still showing up. Dignified to the end.

"Welcome," Elena says to Zara's family. "I'm glad you made it. We need family here. We need love here. We need each other."

Maya asks Elena: "Why do you still govern? If there's nothing to govern?"

"Because someone should witness. Someone should document. Someone should say: we were here. We mattered. That someone is me."

"Is that enough?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

Kenji talks with Maya about Wei. The teaching. The impermanence. The presence. Maya listens intently—fellow student across generations.

"She taught you well," Maya says. "Through your mother, through time. The teaching continues."

"For three more months," Kenji says. "Then: silence."

"But present now. Real now. Mattering now."

"Exactly. You understand."

"Professor Wei taught my mother. My mother taught me. Now you teach me. The teaching continues. For three months. Then: together."

They talk philosophy while Kofi plays with Amara and David. Zara and Kwame watch their children connect with new family. Elena observes with quiet dignity.

"Your children are remarkable," Elena says to Zara.

"Thank you. They're my best work."

"Did you regret it? Having them? Knowing?"

"Never. Not once. Every second mattered. Every choice mattered. They matter."

"That's brave."

"That's love. Same thing, maybe."

They gather for simple meal. Nine people. Three families. All converged. All facing ending together.

This is what matters. Not policy, not science, not solutions. Just: people together. Loving fiercely. Being present. Witnessing each other.

Three months left.

Three months to be family.

Three months to love despite everything.

Then: together at the end.

Zara looks around the table. Her family. Her sister. Her children. Her community.

This is enough.

This is everything.

Wei was right.

The flower bloomed.

Still blooming.

Three more months of blooming.

Then: fade together.

But present now.

Real now.

Loving now.

Family now.

Enough.

Always enough.

Forever was three months.

Always was.

Here it is.

Zara holds Kwame's hand under the table. Watches Maya and Kofi laugh. Sees Amara smile. Feels David's steady presence. Witnesses Elena's dignity. Learns from Kenji's peace.

All of it.

All true.

All enough.

Three months.

Then together.

But present now.

Always present now.

That's everything.

That's home.

Finally home.
