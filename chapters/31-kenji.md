# Chapter 31: Kenji

The call comes at dawn. Kenji is meditating in his small apartment when his comm unit buzzes—insistent, urgent. He considers ignoring it. Wei taught him about non-attachment. But attachment and presence are different things. He answers.

Zara's face appears on the screen. She's been crying.

"Kenji. Professor Wei died. This morning. Peacefully. She was ready."

The words land like stones. Wei. Dead. Gone.

Year 12. Three years until the asteroid. Thirty-six years since Kenji's birth. Hours since his teacher's death.

"No," he says. Not denial. Just: response to grief.

"I'm sorry," Zara says. "She went peacefully. The children were with her. She said to tell you: the flower bloomed. She said you'd understand."

Kenji does understand. The gardenia in Wei's garden. Blooming and dying. Meaning not in lasting but in being. Wei lived 126 years. Taught for seventy. Loved freely. Died ready.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.

But it doesn't feel like enough. Not yet. Not when grief is fresh and raw and impossible.

"Tell her—" Kenji stops. Can't tell her anything. She's dead. "Tell Maya and Kofi I'm honoring her from here. I can't come for the funeral, but I'm honoring her."

"I will. She loved you, Kenji. She was so proud of you."

"I loved her too."

The call ends. Kenji sits in the morning light, Antarctica stretching cold and beautiful outside his window, and feels the first person he ever truly loved disappear from the world.

Individual death. Before the collective death. Wei escaped the asteroid by dying naturally.

She would call that mercy.

Kenji calls it loss.

Both are true.

---

He tells his mother first.

Elena is making breakfast when he arrives at her apartment. She sees his face and knows immediately.

"Professor Wei?" she asks gently.

"Yes. This morning. Natural death. She was ready."

Elena pulls him into her arms. Kenji is thirty-six years old, but he cries like a child who lost his grandmother. Because that's what happened. Wei was grandmother, teacher, guide—the person who taught him to stop seeking, to be present, to accept impermanence.

Now she's impermanent.

Now she's gone.

The lesson made visceral.

"I'm so sorry," Elena says. "I know how much she meant to you."

"She changed my life. She taught me everything that matters."

"Then honor her. Live what she taught."

"I don't know how to do that without her."

"Yes you do. She gave you the tools. Now you use them."

Elena makes him tea. They sit together in quiet grief. Mother and son, both facing the reality that people die individually even while waiting for collective death.

"She wrote to me once," Elena says. "Said I governed with dignity. That it was wisdom. I didn't understand then. I do now."

"What did she mean?"

"That power is theater. That presence matters more than control. That bearing witness with dignity is enough." Elena touches Kenji's hand. "She taught you the same thing. Just: be here. Be present. That's enough."

"It doesn't feel like enough."

"It never does. But it is."

They sit in silence. Outside, Antarctica functions. Inside, they grieve. Across the world, in Lagos, Zara and her children grieve too. Everyone who loved Wei feeling the absence where a person used to be.

This is what collective death will prevent. This individual grief. This personal loss. When the asteroid hits, everyone dies together. No one left to grieve. No absence because everything is absence.

Wei escaped that. Died individually. Got to choose her witnesses, say her goodbyes, go peacefully.

Mercy and tragedy. Both true at once.

---

Kenji creates a shrine in his apartment.

Small table near the window. Photo of Wei—one Zara sent months ago, Wei in her garden under the lemon tree, smiling gently. Candles. Incense. Simple offerings.

Not Buddhist practice exactly. Wei wasn't religious. But: ritual helps grief. Gives it form. Makes absence visible so you can honor it.

He sits before the shrine and meditates. Not praying—Wei didn't believe in prayer. Just: being present with the loss. Feeling it fully. Not pushing away, not clinging to. Just: observing grief like observing breath.

It hurts.

Wei would say: yes, it hurts. That's love persisting after loss. Feel it. Don't run from it.

So Kenji feels it. The ache in his chest. The emptiness where her wisdom used to live. The knowledge that he can't ask her questions anymore, can't sit in her garden, can't hear her gentle voice teaching about impermanence.

She's impermanent now.

The lesson is complete.

He cries in front of the shrine. Long, wrenching sobs. First person he loved who died. First experience with individual loss before collective loss.

This is practice. Wei knew that. Died deliberately, peacefully, showing him how it's done.

Be present. Even in grief. Especially in grief.

He sits until the crying stops. Until the grief settles from acute to chronic. Until he can breathe again.

The photo of Wei smiles gently. She looks peaceful. Ready. At the end of a full life.

Kenji is thirty-six. Not ready. Not full. Just: here. With three years left.

But Wei taught him: readiness doesn't matter. Presence matters. Being here matters.

Even when it hurts. Especially when it hurts.

Days later, Kenji visits Amara and David.

They're at the solar arrays—working together, connected in ways they weren't years ago. When Kenji arrives, they see his face and stop working.

"Professor Wei died," he says simply.

"Oh, Kenji." Amara climbs down from the platform, pulls him into a hug. "I'm so sorry."

They sit on the platform—three people who've been transformed by grief and time and impermanence. Kenji tells them about Wei. About the gardenia teaching. About learning to stop seeking. About her death—peaceful, ready, witnessed.

"She sounds remarkable," David says.

"She was. Is. Her teaching continues even though she's gone."

"That's legacy," Amara says. "Not in lasting forever. In changing people who then change others. She changed you. You'll carry that forward."

"To who? We have three years. Then everyone's gone. No one to carry anything to."

"To us," David says. "To your mother. To Ibrahim. To whoever's here now. Legacy isn't about distant future. It's about right now. You share what she taught you. We learn. That's legacy."

Kenji nods slowly. Realizes: David's right. Wei's teaching doesn't need centuries to matter. Needs now. Needs him sharing it with people he loves. Needs presence, not permanence.

"She taught me about impermanence," Kenji says. "That nothing lasts. That meaning is in being, not lasting. The asteroid doesn't change this—life was always impermanent. We just see it clearly now."

"Is that comforting?" Amara asks.

"Sometimes. When I remember. When I practice." Kenji looks at them—mentor and uncle-figure, both reconnected after years apart. "You two embody it. You wasted ten years. You're not wasting three. That's what Wei taught. Be present now. Don't wait for perfect. Now is all there is."

"Your teacher was wise," David says.

"She was. And now she's dead. And I'm learning that wisdom persists through memory, through teaching, through people carrying it forward. Not forever. Just: now."

They sit on the platform, two hundred meters up, wind whipping cold, three years stretching ahead. Below, robots maintain arrays. Above, sky circles endlessly. Between, humans try to understand how to be present in the face of ending.

Wei knew. She taught them. Now they practice.

That's enough.

Has to be.

Week later, Kenji visits Ibrahim.

The wounded fighter is in his fourth-floor apartment, reading philosophy. He's transformed over two years in Antarctica—learning to live without certainty, without faith, without the identity that defined him.

"Kenji," Ibrahim says, surprised. "Come in."

They sit in the small space. Kenji tells him about Wei's death. About grief. About learning loss before Loss comes.

"I'm sorry," Ibrahim says. "Losing someone you love is... I don't have words for it. When I lost faith, it felt like death. But actual death must be worse."

"Different. Both are loss. Both hurt." Kenji pauses. "Wei taught me about impermanence. About accepting that nothing lasts. You're learning the same thing—accepting uncertainty, living without fixed beliefs."

"Is it the same?"

"Not exactly. But related. We both had something solid we relied on—you had faith, I had seeking. Both fell apart. Both of us are learning to be present without that solidity."

Ibrahim nods slowly. "Your teacher sounds like someone I would have liked to meet."

"She would have liked you. She respected honest doubt more than false certainty. You're honest now. That's everything."

"It doesn't feel like everything."

"It never does. But it is."

They talk for hours. Kenji shares Wei's teachings—not as gospel, just as tools. Impermanence. Non-clinging. Presence. Being here without needing permanent meaning.

Ibrahim listens. Questions. Pushes back sometimes. Accepts sometimes. Learning.

"Thank you," Ibrahim says when Kenji leaves. "For sharing your teacher with me."

"She would want me to. Teaching was what she did. I'm just continuing it."

"That's good legacy."

"That's enough legacy."

Month later, Kenji writes to Zara.

The networks are failing—messages take days, sometimes don't arrive at all. But he tries:

*Zara,*

*I'm sorry I couldn't be there for Wei's funeral. Travel is impossible now. But I'm honoring her from here. Created a shrine. Meditate daily. Share her teachings with everyone who'll listen.*

*She changed my life. I came to her desperate, seeking answers everywhere. She taught me the seeking was the problem. That presence matters more than answers. That impermanence isn't terrible—it's true.*

*I'm so grateful you cared for her. That you let Maya and Kofi love her. That you were her neighbor, her student, her caretaker. You made her last years beautiful. That's everything.*

*She loved you. She said you were the bravest person she knew—choosing to have Kofi after detection, loving fiercely despite knowing it's brief. She said that was wisdom.*

*I'm carrying her teaching forward. For three years. Until I can't. Then someone else. Then no one. But for now: it continues.*

*The flower bloomed.*

*That's enough.*

*With love and grief,  
Kenji*

He sends it. Doesn't know if it arrives. Doesn't matter. The writing helps. The remembering helps. The carrying forward helps.

Wei is gone. Her teaching remains.

For three years. Then gone too.

But present now. Real now. Mattering now.

That's enough.

Wei said so.

And Wei was wise.

---

One evening, sitting before Wei's shrine, Kenji realizes: she's preparing him.

Her death is practice for his own death. She showed him how it's done—peacefully, ready, surrounded by love, accepting what comes.

In three years, he dies too. Asteroid impact. Not natural, not peaceful, not ready. But: with people he loves. With his mother. With friends. Together.

Different death than Wei's. But death nonetheless.

She taught him: readiness doesn't matter. Presence matters. Be here now. Even when afraid. Especially when afraid.

He's not ready. Thirty-six years old. Should have decades more. Instead: three years.

But Wei taught him: should doesn't matter. Is matters.

Is: three years left. Is: mother alive. Is: friends present. Is: teachings to share. Is: moments to experience. Is: love to feel.

That's enough.

Has to be.

Wei lived 126 years and said it was enough. Kenji gets thirty-nine and must say the same.

Not equal. Not fair. But true.

The flower bloomed.

Brief or long, the blooming matters. Not the duration. The being.

Kenji is being.

For three more years.

Then: not being.

But present now.

That's everything.

Wei proved it.

Now Kenji practices it.

Her final gift: teaching him through her death how to approach his own.

Individual loss before collective loss.

Practice grief before Grief.

Learn letting go before being let go of.

Mercy wrapped in pain.

Love persisting through absence.

The shrine holds Wei's photo. The incense burns. The candles flicker.

She's gone.

Her teaching remains.

Through him. Through Zara. Through Maya and Kofi. Through everyone she touched.

For three more years.

Then: silence.

But present now. Real now. Mattering now.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.

Always was.

Wei knew it.

Now Kenji knows it too.

Three years left.

Three years to bloom.

Three years to teach.

Three years to be present.

Then: fade.

Like Wei.

Like the gardenia.

Like everything.

Brief and perfect and true.

Enough.

Always enough.

Wei said so.

And Wei was wise.

Right until the end.

The shrine glows in the dark.

Kenji meditates.

Grief and gratitude, tangled together.

Loss and love, both true at once.

Wei is gone.

Wei remains.

Both.

Always both.

That's the teaching.

That's the truth.

That's enough.

The flower bloomed.
