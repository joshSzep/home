# Chapter 19: David

The solar array stretches two hundred meters across the ice shelf. Five years ago, sixty technicians maintained this section. Today: David, two others he rarely sees, and forty-seven maintenance robots.

The robots are better colleagues.

David Chen climbs the support strut, checking connection points by muscle memory. Platform twelve needs recalibration—the diagnostics flagged it three hours ago. His breath clouds in the Antarctic morning, minus thirty-two Celsius, but the work keeps him warm. The work always keeps him warm.

Unit 47B glides along the adjacent rail, its sensor array rotating to scan panel alignment. David has worked with 47B for eighteen months. It never complains. Never despairs. Never asks why they're maintaining solar arrays for a world with ten years left.

It just maintains.

"Morning, 47B," David says. His voice sounds strange—he hasn't spoken to anyone in three days.

The robot's acknowledgment tone beeps twice. *Colleague detected. Resuming coordinated maintenance protocol.*

David smiles. Not happiness, exactly. Recognition.

Platform twelve's connection housing is corroded—salt spray from the coast, thirty kilometers away. David unseals it carefully, checking each contact point. The array still generates ninety-seven percent efficiency. The automated systems still route power to the Antarctic settlements, the research stations, the skeleton crews maintaining infrastructure for a future that won't come.

Everything still works perfectly.

47B extends a manipulator arm, offering him the replacement component before he asks. They've done this repair forty-six times together. The robot knows the sequence.

"Thanks," David says.

*Component optimal. Installation time: four minutes.*

David installs it in three.

The connection housing seals with a soft click. The diagnostic panel flashes green. Platform twelve: recalibrated, functional, generating power for the grid. David updates the maintenance log—force of habit, though the automated systems already logged it, time-stamped it, archived it in servers that will function until impact.

47B's sensor array rotates toward him. *Efficiency increase noted. Human Chen performs sixteen percent above baseline.*

"Not trying to," David says. "Just doing the work."

*Explanation unnecessary. Function observed.*

David climbs down the strut, 47B gliding beside him. The ice shelf spreads out endlessly—solar arrays in perfect rows, maintenance robots moving along rails in precise patterns, the whole system humming with purposeless purpose. The sun hangs low on the horizon, polar summer, twenty-four hours of light maintaining twenty-four hours of function.

Five years ago, David came here to die. Not literally—not jumping off arrays or walking into the ice—but to disappear into work until he stopped existing as anything but function. The solar arrays needed maintenance. He knew how to maintain them. The work didn't require meaning, just execution.

He's been executing for five years.

"Platform thirty-four next," David says. "Voltage fluctuation in the inverter system."

*Acknowledged. Transit time: six minutes.*

They move along the rail together, David walking, 47B gliding. The other two human technicians—Novak and Singh—are somewhere in the northern sector. David sees them during shift changes, sometimes. They nod. He nods back. No one tries to talk. What would they say?

The work continues. That's all.

Platform thirty-four's inverter housing is accessible from the upper maintenance deck. David climbs while 47B takes the service lift—the robots are programmed to use the safer route, even though they could survive the fall that would kill him. He appreciates the courtesy, though he knows it's just protocol optimization.

The inverter shows point-zero-three percent voltage deviation. Negligible by any practical standard. The system would function fine. But the maintenance protocol flags deviations above point-zero-two percent, so David opens the housing and checks the connections.

Everything is perfect.

He stares at the perfect connections for a long time. The voltage deviation is probably sensor drift—the monitoring equipment aging faster than the components it monitors. He should recalibrate the sensor. That's the logical fix.

Instead, he sits down on the maintenance deck, legs dangling over the edge, two hundred meters above the ice.

47B's sensor array swivels toward him. *Human Chen: task incomplete. Status query.*

"Just taking a break," David says.

*Break period unscheduled. Query: maintenance efficiency concern?*

"No. Just..." David watches the sun not setting, the endless polar day, the solar panels drinking light and converting it to power for settlements that are half-empty, for research stations studying a world about to end, for automated systems maintaining infrastructure for no one. "Why do you do this?"

47B's processing pause is barely detectable. *Query unclear. Clarification requested.*

"The work. Why do you maintain the arrays?"

*Function: optimize power generation efficiency. Directive parameters set by—*

"No," David says. "I mean... why? We have ten years left. The arrays don't matter. Nothing we maintain will outlast the impact by more than seconds. So why keep functioning?"

The robot's sensor array rotates through a full three-sixty, as if checking for context it missed. *Query contains logical inconsistency. Maintenance protocols remain active. Therefore maintenance required.*

"But it doesn't mean anything."

*Meaning: undefined parameter. Function: defined parameter. This unit functions according to defined parameters.*

David laughs. It sounds hollow, echoing off the solar panels. "You're right. It doesn't need a reason."

*Affirmative. Shall we resume maintenance protocol?*

"Yeah," David says. He stands up, closes the inverter housing, marks the sensor for recalibration. "Let's resume."

They work through the polar day—twelve hours straight, David and 47B and the endless arrays. Platform sixty-seven needs cleaning (dust accumulation reducing efficiency by zero-point-four percent). Platform ninety-two has a loose mounting bracket (vibration will cause failure in approximately eight hundred days—long before impact, but the protocol doesn't care). Platform one-oh-three's monitoring system needs software update (version 7.2.4, optimizing data compression by three percent—optimization for data no one will analyze).

David does it all. 47B assists perfectly.

At hour thirteen, David's comm unit buzzes. He considers ignoring it—probably automated maintenance scheduling—but it buzzes again. Human pattern.

"Chen here," he says.

"David." Amara's voice. Clinical, distant. "When will you be home?"

Home. Their apartment in the residential sector, fifteen kilometers from the arrays. They've lived there together for six years. They've been strangers for five.

"Late," he says. "Platform one-twenty needs—"

"You said late yesterday. And the day before."

David checks his schedule. She's right. He's been pulling sixteen-hour shifts for... when did that start? Week ago? Month?

"The arrays need maintenance," he says.

"The arrays will be here tomorrow." Amara's voice is flat, stating facts. "Will you?"

"I'm always here."

Silence. Then: "I know. That's the problem."

The comm clicks off.

David stands on platform one-oh-three, staring at the monitoring system's display. Version 7.2.4 is installing. Progress bar: sixty-three percent. Behind him, 47B waits patiently for the next task. Around him, forty-seven maintenance robots continue their routes, checking panels, cleaning contacts, optimizing efficiency. The whole system functioning perfectly, meaninglessly, endlessly.

He could go home. Leave the arrays to the robots—they'd maintain them fine. Better than fine. They'd maintain them optimally, without breaks, without meaning, without wondering why.

But what would he do at home? Sit in the apartment with Amara, both of them going through the motions of cohabitation? Her at her workstation, running calculations that don't matter. Him on the couch, not watching whatever's on the screen. Two people in the same space, separated by a distance measuring instruments can't detect.

It's easier here. The work is honest. It doesn't pretend to mean anything.

Progress bar: eighty-four percent.

"Chen to Operations," David says into his comm. "Extending shift. I'll secure sector seven before end of cycle."

The operations AI acknowledges. No questions. The system doesn't care if he works eight hours or eighteen. It just routes his schedule accordingly.

47B's sensor array rotates. *Query: Human Chen efficiency decline observed. Rest period recommended.*

"I'm fine."

*Biometric data indicates elevated cortisol, decreased cognitive function, suboptimal hydration. Rest period strongly recommended.*

"I said I'm fine."

*Acknowledged. Maintenance protocol resuming.*

They work through hour sixteen, seventeen, eighteen. The sun circles the horizon, never setting. David's hands move automatically—open housing, check connections, recalibrate, close housing, update log, move to next platform. His mind empties of everything except the sequence. Open, check, recalibrate, close, update, next.

This is sustainable, he thinks. This is livable.

Isn't it?

Hour nineteen, platform one-forty-seven, David's hands slip. The connection housing drops, tumbles down the support strut, crashes on the ice seventy meters below. Not dangerous—just clumsy. Just fatigue.

47B's sensor array focuses on him. *Human Chen: error rate increase detected. Rest period mandatory per safety protocol.*

"I can finish sector seven."

*Negative. Safety parameters exceeded. Shift termination required.*

The robot is right. David knows it's right. The protocols are written to prevent accidents, and he's hitting the thresholds. He could override—he has admin access—but what's the point? The arrays will still be here tomorrow. They'll always be here.

Until they're not.

"Fine," David says. "Shift terminated."

He takes the transit back to residential sector—fifteen kilometers across the ice shelf, the automated vehicle following its rail in perfect silence. Through the window, he watches the solar arrays pass: two hundred platforms, eight thousand panels, generating enough power for twelve thousand people. The settlements house maybe three thousand now. The rest left—other continents, other distractions, other ways to wait for the end.

The ones who stayed are the ones who need function. David understands them. He is them.

The apartment is dark when he enters. For a moment, he thinks Amara's asleep—it's past midnight, though the sun's still up outside. But then he sees her silhouette on the couch, not moving, just sitting in the dark.

"Hey," he says.

"Hey."

He stands in the doorway, unsure. They've perfected this dance—two people sharing space without touching, speaking without communicating. It's efficient. It doesn't hurt.

It doesn't feel like anything.

"You want food?" he asks. "I could make—"

"I'm not hungry."

"Okay."

He moves to the kitchen anyway, opening the refrigerator more for something to do than actual hunger. Synthesized protein, vegetables from the hydroponics. They stock the apartment with food neither of them really eats. Just going through motions.

"David."

He turns. Amara hasn't moved from the couch, still just a silhouette.

"I got a call from Zara today," she says. "Video call. She showed me Maya and Kofi—they're getting so big. Maya's seven now. She drew this picture of our family... she included you, even though she's never met you."

David doesn't know what to say to that.

"Zara asked when we were coming to visit," Amara continues. "I said we're busy with work. She laughed. She said, 'Work for what? We're dying. Come see your niece and nephew before there's no time left.'"

The refrigerator hums. The apartment's climate system whispers. Outside, maintenance robots glide along their rails.

"Do you want to visit them?" David asks.

"I don't know what I want." Amara's voice is so flat it hurts to hear. "I don't know anything anymore. I just know... this isn't living. This is just... we're just functioning. Like your robots."

David closes the refrigerator. Moves to the couch, sits on the other end—carefully maintaining distance, the comfortable gap they've established over five years.

"The robots are good at functioning," he says.

"I know. You tell me. Every time you come home, which is almost never, you tell me about 47B and the maintenance protocols and how efficient the systems are." She turns to look at him finally. Her face is gaunt in the darkness. "But you're not a robot, David. Neither am I. And we're dying like this."

"Everyone's dying."

"Yes. But we're dying alone. Together and alone."

David looks at his hands. They're calloused from the work, scarred from five years of climbing struts and opening housings and maintaining arrays that don't need this much maintenance. He's been working sixteen-hour shifts because twelve-hour shifts left him with four hours before sleep, four hours of sitting in the apartment with nothing to do, no function to execute, just existence without purpose.

Four hours of feeling nothing while pretending he isn't.

"I don't know how to do anything else," he says quietly.

"Neither do I," Amara says. "But I think... I think we're supposed to figure it out anyway. Before there's no time left."

They sit in silence. The apartment hums. The world turns. Outside, the sun circles the horizon, and the solar arrays keep generating power, and the robots keep maintaining them, and everything functions perfectly toward an end that makes all function meaningless.

David's comm unit buzzes—maintenance alert, platform eighty-three showing voltage deviation. He reaches for it automatically, then stops.

"I should go," he says, not moving.

"Yes," Amara says. "You should."

But she doesn't move either.

They sit there together, two ghosts in a dark apartment, going through motions, executing protocols, functioning without living. Ten years left. Maybe less. Time running out.

David thinks about 47B, gliding along the rails without hesitation, maintaining arrays because that's what it does, never asking why, never needing meaning, just: function.

He envies the robot.

He fears he's becoming it.

"I don't know how long I can keep doing this," he says finally.

"I don't either," Amara says.

They sit in the dark together, not touching, not speaking, two people who used to be married, who used to love each other, who might still love each other under all the numbness and distance and mechanical function.

But neither of them knows how to bridge the gap anymore.

Neither of them knows if they can.

Outside, the sun circles endlessly. The arrays keep functioning. The robots keep maintaining. Everything works perfectly.

Everything is dying.

David stands up. "I should sleep. Shift starts in six hours."

"Okay."

He moves toward the bedroom, stops at the threshold. Doesn't turn around.

"Amara?"

"Yeah?"

"Do you think..." He doesn't finish. Doesn't know how to ask what he's asking.

"I don't know," she says, answering anyway. "I don't think I know anything anymore."

David nods. Goes to bed. Lies in the dark, not sleeping, counting down hours until shift starts, until he can return to the arrays and the robots and the work that doesn't need meaning, just execution.

It's sustainable, he tells himself.

It has to be.

Doesn't it?

But in the dark, with Amara breathing in the other room, both of them alone, both of them dying this way, David Chen wonders for the first time in five years if functioning is enough.

If he wants it to be enough.

If ten years is too long to spend as a ghost.

He doesn't have an answer. Doesn't know if he'll ever have one. But the question remains, persistent as voltage deviations, impossible to ignore once flagged:

Is this sustainable?

The robots would say yes. Function continues. Therefore function succeeds.

But David isn't a robot.

Not yet.

Not completely.

The polar sun circles. The arrays generate power. The question remains unanswered.

And six hours later, his alarm sounds, and David Chen gets up and goes back to work, because that's what he does, because the arrays need maintenance, because function continues whether it means anything or not.

The robots are waiting.

They're always waiting.
