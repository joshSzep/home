# Chapter 9: One Year After

**POV: Seven Voices | Year 1, Day 365**

---

## Amara — Antarctic Monitoring Station, 3:47 AM

Exactly one year.

Amara sat at her workstation, the only occupied seat among sixty. The station hummed its familiar lullaby—cooling systems, data processors, the distant creak of ice. Same sounds as 365 days ago. Same time. Same place.

Different world.

Her screen displayed the countdown: **14 years, 0 months, 0 days remaining.**

One year gone. Fourteen left. The asteroid approaching with perfect mathematical precision. She'd updated the trajectory 10,847 times. Every calculation confirmed the same result. Impact probability: 99.97%. Time remaining: precisely 5,113 days.

Fourteen years.

It sounded like a lot. It wasn't.

The station was almost empty now. Amara and two others. Dr. Kim worked day shift. Dr. Patel took evenings. Amara had graveyard—her preference, her isolation, her choice. Sixty workstations. Three people. The building felt like a tomb.

She'd become the face of extinction. "Dr. Amara Okafor, the woman who detected the apocalypse." Her face on every news network. Her data in every briefing. Her calculations describing everyone's death. Famous. Isolated. Numb.

She pulled up Zara's messages. Hadn't opened them in months. The counter read: 127 unread. Her sister had kept trying. Kept sending updates. Photos of Maya. Videos of Kofi—born six months ago, healthy, doomed. Voice messages asking for connection.

Amara read the most recent: *"It's been a year, Amara. A whole year of silence. I don't know if you're getting these. I don't know if you care. But... I'm your sister. Maya is your niece. Kofi is your nephew. We're family. And we have fourteen years left. Please. Just respond."*

Amara stared at her sister's contact information. Her finger hovered over the call button. Had hovered there 365 days ago. Still hovering. Still unable to press.

What would she say? *Sorry I calculated your children's deaths and then vanished into data*?

She closed the messages. Returned to her calculations. Updated the trajectory. The asteroid was exactly where physics said it would be. Perfect. Predictable. Inevitable.

One year. She'd spent it isolated, calculating, numb. David barely spoke to her. Zara had given up. Colleagues had fled. She was alone with the data.

This was her choice. This was her survival. This was how she spent the first year: counting down to extinction, one update at a time, alone.

Reflection in the dark screen: barely recognized herself. Thinner. Older. Hollowed out. The price of numbness.

She returned to work. Because what else? The calculations needed updating. The countdown continued. The isolation deepened.

One year down. Fourteen to go.

Alone.

## Zara — Lagos Garden, Morning

Four months pregnant with Kofi. No—wait. She'd given birth. Kofi was six months old now. Time blurred in the constant attention babies demanded.

Maya was three. Kofi was six months. Both healthy. Both doomed. Zara had chosen this—chosen life despite extinction. Everyone called her cruel. Cruel to give Maya a doomed sister. Cruel to bring Kofi into a dying world.

She didn't care. Her children mattered. Brief didn't mean meaningless. Wei taught her that.

Every morning: Wei's garden. Zara, Maya, and now Kofi. Sitting among the gardenias and vegetables. Learning impermanence. Learning presence. Wei teaching through silence and flowers and the rhythm of growth and decay.

"See how lemon blooms?" Wei said, pointing with her cane. 115 years old now, body failing, mind sharp. "This morning, four new flowers. By evening, one will fall. That's how life works. Blooming and falling. Maya understands. Don't you, Maya?"

Maya nodded seriously. "Flowers don't last. Nothing lasts. But they're still pretty."

"Very good." Wei's approval warmed. "Your mother learned quickly. Now she teaches you."

Zara held Kofi, who babbled happily. Six months old. Thirteen years left. He'd die at thirteen. Never reach fourteen. Never reach adulthood. But right now: alive, healthy, laughing.

That had to count.

One year since detection. Zara had spent it defiant. Pregnant, then parenting. Building family in apocalypse. Rejecting the logic that said brief life wasn't worth living. Choosing presence over despair.

Hard choice. Daily choice. Worth it? She didn't know. But Kofi was here. Maya was growing. Family was real.

Fourteen years left. She'd spend them loving her children completely. Presence until the end. That was her practice. That was her defiance.

"Garden tomorrow?" Maya asked.

"Garden every day," Zara confirmed.

Wei smiled. "Good students."

One year down. Practice continuing. Life defiant. Love despite ending.

Enough.

## Elena — Mayor's Office, Morning Briefing

Conference table for fifty. Present: five. Elena, Marcus, Chen, Kowalski, Dr. Ade. Same people as six months ago. Everyone else quit or fled or died.

"Population report," Elena said, starting the ritual.

"Two point eight billion," Chen reported. "Down from four point two billion at detection. Thirty-three percent loss in one year."

Two point eight billion. Elena documented this. Who would read these notes? No one. But someone should record. Someone should say: we were here. We tried. We maintained dignity.

"Infrastructure at fifty-five percent. Security adequate. Health services struggling." The reports continued. Everything declining. Everything failing slowly. Everything maintained as long as possible by skeleton crew.

"Orders, Mayor?"

Elena gave the same answer as always: "Maintain what we can. Document what we can't. Continue."

After: Marcus stayed. "One year," he said.

"One year," Elena confirmed.

"Fourteen more."

"Fourteen more."

They sat in the too-large room, five people governing a dying city, and didn't talk about futility. Didn't need to. The work continued because someone had to do it. Because bearing witness mattered. Because presence was purpose.

Wei's letters helped. Weekly reminders that governance wasn't about outcome. Was about practice. Elena governed not to save anyone. To be present to them. To maintain dignity. To show up.

That was enough. Had to be.

Kenji was home. That mattered. He'd stopped spiraling—mostly. Still struggled. Still broken. But present. Living with her now. Trying. That was all anyone could do.

One year. She'd spent it governing emptiness. Maintaining order in chaos. Bearing witness to collapse. Purpose without outcome. Presence without solution.

Fourteen years left to continue. She would. Because what else? This was her practice. This was her presence. This was enough.

The work continued.

## David — Solar Array, Noon

Platform 73. 200 meters up. David and Robot 47B performing maintenance. Connection housing recalibration—127th time in eight years.

One year since detection. David had kept working. Everyone else quit. The arrays barely needed humans anymore—automation handled most tasks. But David showed up. Every day. Maintained the systems that would operate for fourteen more years, then: vaporize.

Why? He'd stopped knowing. Just: work was what he did. Maintenance was practice. Showing up was enough.

Amara was gone. Not dead. Just: absent. Their marriage had died slowly, then quickly. Now: strangers sharing space. He still loved her. She couldn't feel anything. The gulf was unbridgeable.

He'd thought about jumping. Platform edge right there. Quick end instead of slow countdown. But: arrays needed maintaining. Work needed doing. So he kept going.

47B chirped status update. David responded automatically. They worked in comfortable silence. Robot better colleague than most humans. Reliable. Present. Simple.

One year gone. Fourteen left. David would spend them maintaining. Because that's what he did. Because work was better than nothing. Because showing up mattered even when outcome was certain.

Small practice. Quiet practice. Maintenance as meditation.

Enough.

## Kenji — Elena's Apartment, Afternoon

One year since detection. Kenji was... alive. Barely. Differently.

He'd stopped the constant parties. Mostly. Still spiraled sometimes—few days lost to substances, to forgetting, to obliteration. But not constantly. Not every day. Progress, maybe.

Living with his mother now. Elena didn't judge. Just: present. Made tea. Held space. Let him figure it out.

He wasn't figured out. Wasn't okay. Wasn't functional. But: present sometimes. That was different than before.

The dissertation was still closed. Career still dead. Future still impossible to imagine. But: he'd started reading. Philosophy mostly. Buddhist stuff. Stoic stuff. People who'd thought about meaninglessness before. Helped slightly.

Michael's words stayed with him: *Does everything need to last to matter?* Kenji didn't have answer. But the question felt important. Felt like maybe there was answer, even if he couldn't access it yet.

One year. Spent in spiral, mostly. But spiraling less. Drowning less. Thinking more. Still lost. But: different lost. Present lost instead of obliterated lost.

Fourteen years left. He had no idea how to spend them. But: today, he was alive. Sitting in his mother's apartment. Reading. Thinking. Being.

Tomorrow: probably harder. Maybe easier. Definitely uncertain.

But today was today. That was something.

Small something.

Beginning something.

Maybe.

## Ibrahim — Jerusalem Camp, Evening

One year faithless.

Ibrahim knelt with his brothers for evening prayer. Automatic. Body doing what body had always done. But: nothing behind it. No connection. No belief. Just: going through motions because alternative was isolation.

The camp had noticed. Imam had stopped trying to restore his faith. Brothers tolerated him but didn't trust him. He was hollow shell pretending faith.

Why stay? Where else? Faith defined his identity. Without it: nothing. No purpose. No structure. No Ibrahim.

One year of emptiness. Fourteen years of same ahead. The prospect was unbearable. Prayer beads in hand feeling like stones. Words feeling like noise. Everything meaning nothing.

The question remained: if not faith, then what? No answer yet. Maybe no answer ever. Just: hollow man performing hollow rituals until extinction made it irrelevant.

One year down. This was how he spent it: going through motions. Existing without living. Present without presence.

Fourteen years of this? Impossible. Something had to change. Had to break. Had to end or begin or transform.

But not yet. Not today. Today: hollow prayers. Empty beads. Meaningless words.

Tomorrow: same.

Until it wasn't.

But that was later. Unknown. Distant.

Today: stones.

## Wei — Lagos Garden, Evening

115 years old. One year older than when the world learned it was ending. Body failing more—knees worse, back constant pain, hands shaking too much for delicate work. Wheelchair most days now. Death approaching naturally, probably before asteroid.

That was fine. She'd been preparing for death forty years. Ready whenever.

One year teaching. Zara, Maya, little Kofi. Others who came to the garden seeking... something. Wisdom, maybe. Or just: witness. She taught through silence and flowers and the simple practice of being present.

Her book was nearly finished. Twenty years writing, suddenly urgent with fourteen years defined. Almost done. Would finish before death—natural death, before extinction.

That felt right. Complete the work. Not for legacy—no one would read it after extinction. For completion itself. The practice of finishing what was started.

One year since detection. She'd spent it practicing what she'd always practiced: presence. Impermanence made visible didn't change the practice. Made it more necessary.

Fourteen years left. Maybe fewer—body failing. She'd continue teaching. Tending garden. Writing. Being present. Until unable.

Then: death. Natural death. Before the asteroid. Before the end.

Ready. Complete. At peace.

The gardenias bloomed. The lemon tree stood patient. Everything temporary. Everything beautiful. Everything here now.

One year down. As many as remained. All of it: enough.

Practice continued. Presence remained. Life bloomed until it didn't.

Simple. True. Complete.

## Closing — Omniscient

Seven people. Seven paths. All diverging.

**Amara**: isolated in calculation, numb by choice, alone by design. One year counting down extinction. Fourteen years ahead the same.

**Zara**: defiant in creation, raising doomed children, practicing presence. One year building family. Fourteen years ahead loving completely.

**Elena**: maintaining governance, bearing witness, showing up daily. One year holding briefings for five. Fourteen years ahead continuing.

**David**: mechanical maintenance, quiet presence, working despite futility. One year keeping arrays operational. Fourteen years ahead the same.

**Kenji**: spiraling less, drowning intermittent, seeking something unknown. One year surviving barely. Fourteen years ahead uncertain.

**Ibrahim**: hollow faith, empty prayers, going through motions. One year faithless. Fourteen years ahead unbearable.

**Wei**: present teacher, garden tender, preparing for natural death. One year practicing. However many remained the same.

One year gone. Fourteen remain. The fracture complete. Everyone scattered. Everyone coping differently. Everyone facing the end their own way.

The divergence is deepest now. Isolation maximized. Connection minimized. Everyone separate. Everyone alone. Even together—alone.

But: time remains. Fourteen years. 5,113 days. Enough time for change. For reconnection. For transformation. For healing. For whatever comes next.

Not yet. Not today. Today: scattered. Fractured. Separate.

But later...

Later, the scattered begin gathering. The fractured begin healing. The separate begin connecting.

Not because the asteroid changes course. Because people change. Because isolation becomes unbearable. Because presence calls louder than numbness. Because love persists despite ending.

But that's later. That's Part II. That's years ahead.

Today, at the end of Year 1, everyone is scattered. The divergence complete. The fracture maximized.

Seven people. Seven paths. All separate.

Fourteen years remain.

Everything can change in fourteen years.

Everything will.

But not yet.

**End Part I: Detection**

---

*The world learned. The world reacted. The world fractured.*

*Now: the long middle. The searching. The separation. The slow movement toward convergence.*

*But that comes later.*

*First: seven people must live their fracture. Must survive their isolation. Must find—or fail to find—what comes after detection.*

*Fourteen years.*

*That's what remains.*

*How will they spend them?*
