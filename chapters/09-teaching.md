# Chapter 9 - Teaching

The garden changes with the seasons.

Professor Mei-Lin Wei watches from her bench as Maya and Kofi play among the flowers. Maya is seven now—reading to her brother from a picture book, teaching him about butterflies. Kofi is four—delighted by everything, discovering the world with pure wonder.

Five years have passed since the detection. Five years of teaching, watching, being present as the world slowly fractures.

Wei is one hundred nineteen years old. Her body is failing in small, inevitable ways. She needs a wheelchair now. Can't walk more than a few steps. Her hands shake. Her vision blurs sometimes.

But her mind remains clear. Sharp. Present.

And there is still work to do.

###

The office is almost empty.

Mayor Elena Torres sits at the council table where thirty department heads used to gather for morning briefings. Now there are three people: Marcus, her assistant. Chen, the infrastructure coordinator. And Elena herself.

Five years after the detection. Ten years until impact.

"Infrastructure report," Elena says, maintaining the ritual even though it feels absurd.

Chen pulls up data. "Power grid at 54% capacity. Water at 69%. Transport at 31% and dropping. We've lost another 200 maintenance workers this quarter. The automated systems are holding most infrastructure together, but manual repairs are becoming impossible."

"Population?"

Marcus answers. "Two million remaining. Down from four million at detection. Birth rate effectively zero. Death rate climbing. Five hundred confirmed deaths last month. Mostly suicide, some violence, some natural."

Elena nods. Expected. She's been watching the slow exodus for five years.

"Thank you. Same time tomorrow."

They file out. Elena sits alone in the empty council chamber.

She's been Mayor for eight years. Fought for this position. Wanted to lead, to serve, to make a difference.

Now she governs ruins.

Why does she keep doing this?

###

Zara comes out with tea. Sets it carefully beside Wei's wheelchair.

"Thank you, dear."

"The children are happy today." Zara watches them play. "Maya's reading has improved so much. She's teaching Kofi his letters now."

"She's a natural teacher. Like her mother."

Zara sits on the bench, silent for a moment. Then: "Professor Wei, do you ever regret not having children?"

"Sometimes. When I was younger. My husband and I tried, but it didn't happen. We made peace with it." Wei watches the children. "But I've had many students over the years. That's a kind of children. And now I have you, Maya, Kofi. My chosen family."

"We're grateful for you." Zara's voice is thick. "I don't know how I would have survived these five years without your wisdom."

"You would have survived. You're strong. But perhaps I made it easier. That's enough."

Maya runs over. "Grandmother Wei! Look!" She holds out a caterpillar on a leaf. "It's eating! We're going to watch it turn into a butterfly!"

"Will it happen before—" Kofi starts to ask, then stops.

Before the asteroid. That's what he was going to ask.

Maya jumps in quickly. "It happens in a few weeks, silly. Way before then."

Wei sees the look that passes between the children. They know. Even Kofi, only four years old, knows the world is ending.

But they're still here. Still playing. Still finding wonder in caterpillars.

"It's beautiful," Wei says. "Watch it carefully. Transformation is the most miraculous thing. The caterpillar doesn't know it will become a butterfly. It just follows its nature. We should all be so trusting."

The children return to their observations. Zara wipes her eyes.

"They're going to die so young," Zara whispers. "Maya at seventeen. Kofi at fourteen. I'm teaching them everything I can. But there's not enough time. There will never be enough time."

"There was never going to be enough time," Wei says gently. "Even without the asteroid. Even if they lived to eighty. You could never teach them everything. That's not a parent's job. Your job is to love them while they're here. You're doing that perfectly."

"It doesn't feel like enough."

"Love is always enough. And always not enough. Both simultaneously."

###

In the afternoons, when Zara takes the children home for lunch and naps, Wei writes letters.

Correspondence with Elena Torres has become one of her great pleasures. Elena—the mayor trying to hold together a collapsing city. Struggling with powerlessness and purpose.

Wei understands that struggle. Has lived long enough to know that all power is temporary, all structures fall, all certainty dissolves.

She writes:

*Dear Elena,*

*You asked in your last letter how to lead when there's nothing to lead toward. When every decision is temporary, every structure is failing, every future is foreclosed.*

*I have been thinking about this question for five years. Here is what I've learned:*

*Leadership was always temporary. The governments you studied, the cities you built, the systems you maintained—all were temporary even when they seemed permanent. The asteroid simply made this truth visible.*

*You cannot lead toward a lasting future anymore. But you can lead toward present dignity. Toward treating each day as if it matters, because it does matter. Not because it builds toward something eternal, but because people are alive in it.*

*This is harder than leading toward progress. Progress gives narrative, purpose, hope. Presence gives only itself. But presence is more honest. More real. More human.*

*You are not failing, Elena. You are doing the hardest work possible—maintaining meaning when meaning seems impossible. Keep showing up. Not because it changes the outcome. But because showing up with integrity is intrinsically valuable.*

*That is what I am trying to do with my remaining time. Show up. Be present. Teach what I can. Love who is here. Not because it will last, but because it is.*

*With deep respect,*  
*Wei*

She seals the letter. Tomorrow, Zara will take it to the postal center. The mail still functions, barely. Systems holding together through inertia and habit.

How much longer? Wei doesn't know. But for now, the letters reach Elena. The connection persists.

That matters.

###

Kenji finds Elena in her office that afternoon.

Her son—thirty-four years old, back from three years of traveling. He looks different than when he left. Calmer. More centered. Less desperate.

"Mom. Have you eaten today?"

Elena looks up from the report she's reading. Population projections for Year 12. "I had coffee."

"That's not food." He sets down a container. "I brought lunch from the community kitchen. Eat."

"You're taking care of me now?"

"Someone has to. You take care of everyone else."

Elena opens the container. Some kind of grain bowl. She's not hungry, but she eats anyway because Kenji is watching with that concerned-son look.

"How are you?" she asks.

"Better than I was. Professor Wei's teachings help. I meditate now. Try to stay present. Try not to drown in the future that isn't coming." He sits across from her. "How are you?"

"Tired."

"Why do you keep doing this? The governance? Everyone knows there's no real authority left. The systems run on automation. Why show up every day?"

Elena doesn't have a good answer.

"Because someone should," she says finally. "Because if everyone gives up, what do we have? Because maintaining dignity matters even when nothing else does. Because—" She stops. "I don't know, Kenji. Maybe I'm just going through motions. Maybe it's habit. Maybe it's denial. But I show up. I keep the office open. I sign the documents. I mediate when people ask. And somehow that feels better than not doing it."

"Is it duty?"

"Maybe. Or maybe it's the only meaning I have left. Lead until I can't. Serve until it doesn't matter. Bear witness to the end. That's all I have."

Kenji is quiet for a moment. Then: "Professor Wei would say that's enough. That showing up with integrity is intrinsically valuable. Not because it changes anything. Just because it's who you are."

"Professor Wei is very wise."

"She is. You should read her letters again. They help."

###

Six months later, a young man arrives at Wei's garden.

Tall, mixed heritage, intense eyes. He looks exhausted and searching.

"Professor Wei?"

"Yes."

"My name is Kenji Torres. Elena Torres is my mother. She said you might talk with me."

Ah. Elena's son. The one she worries about. The seeker who left Antarctica to travel, to ask questions, to find meaning.

Wei studies him. Sees genuine hunger. Genuine openness. Genuine desperation.

"Sit," she says.

He sits on the bench. Maya runs past chasing a butterfly—seven years old, full of life, ten years from death.

"That's Maya," Wei says. "Her mother Zara lives next door. Maya will die at seventeen. Her brother Kofi at fourteen. Their mother knows this. Still loves them completely. Still raises them with joy. That's meaning-making."

Kenji watches the little girl play. Something in his face softens.

"I've been traveling for two years," he says. "Trying to find a way to live fifteen years. Trying to find meaning. I've tried Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam. Nothing works. I can't force faith. Can't surrender. Can't stop questioning."

"Good."

"Good?"

"You've learned what you don't need. That's progress. Most people waste lifetimes clinging to certainty they don't have. You let go quickly. Now you can learn what you do need."

"What do I need?"

"Tools. Not answers. Tools for being present. For accepting impermanence. For making meaning consciously instead of inheriting it. For living without certainty but also without drowning in meaninglessness."

"Can you teach me?"

Wei considers. She's so tired. Teaching takes energy she barely has. One hundred twenty years old. How much longer does she have? Two years? Five?

But this young man needs guidance. Elena's son. A genuine seeker. And Wei still has knowledge to share.

"I'm old," she says finally. "I don't teach formally anymore. Too tired. But you can visit. We can talk. I'll share what I've learned. You take what's useful. Leave the rest."

Relief washes over his face. "Thank you."

"Thank me after you've learned something. Right now you've just arrived."

###

Kenji comes every day for three months.

Morning visits, when Wei's energy is highest. They sit in the garden. Sometimes Wei talks. Sometimes Kenji talks. Sometimes they sit in silence, watching children play, watching flowers bloom and fade.

Wei teaches him Buddhist concepts—not as religion, but as psychological tools. Impermanence. Non-attachment. The nature of suffering and clinging.

She teaches him existentialist ideas. That meaning is made, not found. That humans are radically free and responsible for creating their own values.

She teaches him humanist ethics. That compassion matters even in a meaningless universe. That treating each other well is intrinsically valuable.

"You're synthesizing," Kenji says one morning. "Buddhism plus existentialism plus humanism. Taking pieces from different philosophies."

"Yes. I've been studying philosophy for ninety years. I take what's useful. Leave dogma. Build my own framework. You should do the same. Don't adopt my philosophy. Build yours."

"How?"

"Live. Pay attention. Notice what helps. Notice what hurts. Adjust. Iterate. Philosophy isn't something you learn from books and apply. It's something you build through living."

One day, Wei picks a gardenia. Perfect white petals. Just opened that morning.

"See this flower?" She holds it carefully. "It bloomed this morning. By tomorrow it will start to brown. In three days it will be dead. Does that make it less beautiful?"

"No," Kenji says.

"Why not?"

"Because beauty isn't about lasting. It's about being."

"Yes." Wei hands him the flower. "You think the asteroid makes life meaningless because life won't last. But life was always not lasting. Every human who ever lived died. Every flower that ever bloomed withered. Impermanence is the nature of reality. The asteroid just made it visible and collective. But the principle is the same. Meaning isn't in lasting. Meaning is in being present to what is, while it is."

Kenji holds the flower, staring at it.

Then he starts crying.

Deep, wrenching sobs. Grief that's been building for three years, finally breaking through.

Wei says nothing. Just sits with him. Lets him feel it.

This is the moment. The crack. The breaking open that allows transformation.

When he's cried himself out, he looks at her. "I don't want to die. I'm not ready."

"I know."

"I'm so angry. That I don't get a full life. That no one does."

"Yes. That anger is real and justified."

"How do I live with it?"

"You feel it. You don't push it away. Anger at injustice is appropriate—this is unjust. But you don't let the anger consume everything. You make space for it, and for joy, and for love, and for beauty. You hold it all. That's what it means to be human."

Kenji stays silent for a long time. Then: "Thank you."

"You're welcome. Now comes the hard part."

"What's that?"

"Living what you've learned. Understanding intellectually is easy. Embodying it is the work of a lifetime. You have ten years. Use them."

###

After Kenji leaves, Elena reads old documents.

The founding charter of Antarctica. Declarations from the Forever Earth movement. Speeches about humanity's commitment to staying, to building, to lasting.

*We will endure,* they said. *We will persist. We will build forever.*

Forever, it turns out, is ninety-eight years.

She starts laughing. Can't help it. The irony is too perfect. They built for eternity. Got a century.

Kenji finds her laughing in her office at midnight.

"Mom? Are you okay?"

"We built forever," she manages between laughs. "Forever is five years."

He stares at her. Then he starts laughing too.

They laugh together until they're crying. Laugh-crying at the absurdity. At the tragedy. At the beautiful, stupid, human desire to build permanent things in an impermanent universe.

When they've both calmed down, Kenji says, "Professor Wei would say the mistake was thinking forever meant eternal. Forever is just: while we're here."

"She's right. She's always right."

"Are you okay?"

Elena wipes her face. Looks at her son—thirty-four years old, transformed by grief and seeking, now here with her, helping her, being present.

"I wasted so much time on power," she says. "On trying to control things. On believing leadership meant having answers. I could have spent more time with you. With your father before he died. With being instead of doing."

"You're here now."

"We have ten years left."

"Then let's not waste them. I'm here. I'm helping. We'll do this together. Not because it changes anything. Just because we can. Because being together is better than being alone."

Elena pulls him into a hug. Holds her son. Her remaining family. Her witness.

"Thank you for coming home."

"Thank you for letting me leave. For letting me find my way back."

###

The Annual Founders Day ceremony is in two weeks.

It's an Antarctica tradition—celebrating the founding of the megacity, honoring the vision of Forever Earth, marking humanity's commitment to this planet.

Used to draw millions. Now Elena's staff tells her: don't bother. No one will come.

Elena schedules it anyway.

"Madam Mayor," Marcus says carefully. "Are you sure? We'll prepare the plaza, set up the stage, arrange security. For maybe a hundred people?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"Because it's Founders Day. Because we've celebrated it for eighty years. Because maintaining tradition matters even when—especially when—tradition is ending."

Marcus doesn't argue. He knows better.

###

Three years pass.

Wei is one hundred twenty-three years old. Bedridden most days. The wheelchair sits empty. She can't even manage that anymore.

Zara cares for her like family. Brings her meals. Reads to her. Sits with her when she's lucid, tends her when she's not.

Maya is ten now. Kofi is seven. They visit every day. Read her stories. Show her pictures they've drawn.

Wei loves their voices. Loves their presence. Knows she won't see them grow up. Won't see Maya at seventeen. Won't see Kofi at fourteen.

She'll die before the asteroid. Individual death, not collective.

There's something fitting about that. A reminder that death was always individual.

Elena writes: *Professor Wei, how do I say goodbye? Not to my city, but to you. You've been my teacher, my guide, my anchor. I'm not ready to lose you.*

Wei writes back, hand shaking, words barely legible:

*Dear Elena,*

*You don't say goodbye. You say thank you. Thank you for the time we had. Thank you for the wisdom shared. Thank you for the connection.*

*I am ready to die. I have been ready for years. I am tired. My body is failing. My time is complete.*

*You are not ready. You have five years left. Use them well. Lead with dignity until the end. Be with your son. Be with the people you love.*

*I will die before you. That is right. I'm old. I've lived fully. You still have living to do.*

*Don't grieve me long. I don't want grief. I want gratitude. For one hundred twenty-three years. For teaching until I couldn't. For loving until the end.*

*Be well, Elena. Be present. Be human.*

*With love,*  
*Wei*

It's her last letter.

The next day, she can't hold a pen anymore.

###

Founders Day arrives.

The plaza can hold half a million people. Today, maybe two hundred attend. Elena sees Kenji in the small crowd. A few old staffers. Some citizens who still cling to ritual.

The stage looks absurd. Massive screens for a crowd that doesn't exist. Sound systems for an audience that isn't listening.

Elena walks to the podium.

Should she cancel? Should she admit this is pointless?

No.

She's here. They're here. Founders Day happens.

"Citizens of Antarctica," she begins. Her voice carries across the nearly empty plaza. "Eighty-three years ago, our founders declared that humanity would remain on Earth. That we would not flee to the stars. That we would build civilization here, on this planet, forever."

A few people laugh bitterly at "forever."

Elena continues. "Forever, it turns out, is ninety-eight years. Eighty-three already passed. Fifteen remaining. Our founders built for permanence. We face impermanence."

She looks at the small crowd. Sees Kenji watching her with love and concern.

"But their vision wasn't false," she says. "They believed in collective action. In cooperation. In building something together. That vision doesn't disappear because the timeline shortened. We're still here. Still building, maintaining, living together. For seven more years, we'll do this. And that matters."

She pauses. Feels emotion rising. Pushes through it.

"I know many of you think this ceremony is absurd. That maintaining traditions is pointless when everything ends. Maybe you're right. But I believe showing up matters. Remembering who we were matters. Honoring what we built matters. Not because it lasts. But because we're still here. Because being human means creating meaning even when meaning seems impossible."

She looks out at the tiny crowd in the massive plaza.

"Thank you for coming. Thank you for being here. Thank you for choosing to witness this moment with me."

She steps down. A few people applaud. Most just watch silently.

Afterward, an old staffer approaches her.

"Thank you, Madam Mayor."

"For what?"

"For still showing up. For maintaining dignity. For remembering. It helps."

Elena cries in her office afterward. Alone. Deep, wrenching sobs.

Not from sadness exactly. From exhaustion. From the weight of carrying something no one else wants to carry.

But also: from gratitude. That someone said thank you. That it helped somebody.

That maybe, just maybe, showing up matters.

###

Six months later, Wei wakes knowing it's her last day.

The knowing is absolute. Not logical—her body talking in ways beyond words. This is the day. This is the end.

Zara is there, as always. Wei opens her eyes. Manages to speak, though her voice is barely a whisper.

"Zara."

"I'm here, Professor Wei."

"Today. I'm going today."

Zara's face crumbles. But she nods. She understands.

"Can I... can I bring the children? To say goodbye?"

"Yes. Please."

Zara brings them. Maya, ten now. Kofi, seven. Both old enough to understand death. Both about to experience it for the first time.

"Grandmother Wei," Maya says, taking her hand. Tears streaming down her face. "I love you."

"I love you too, sweet girl." Wei's voice is fading. Each word costs effort. "Be present. Even when afraid. Be present."

Kofi is crying. "Don't go."

"I must, little one. It's my time." Wei pauses. "Be kind," she says. "That's all that matters. Be kind."

The children kiss her forehead. Leave the room, crying. Zara stays.

"Thank you," Wei whispers. "You made my last years beautiful."

"You made my life bearable," Zara says. "How do I do this without you?"

"You already know how. I taught you. Now you teach others. Maya, Kofi. Other mothers. Other seekers. Pass it on. That's legacy."

Wei closes her eyes. Her breathing slows.

"Don't cling to me," she whispers. "Let me go. Like the flower. Blooming, fading. It's natural. It's okay."

Zara holds her hand. Sits with her. Being present for the end.

Wei's mind drifts. Images, memories, dreams. Her husband, dead twenty-two years. Her students. Her garden. Flowers blooming and fading. Seasons turning. Everything impermanent. Everything temporary. Everything perfect.

She thinks: I'm ready.

She thinks: This is right.

Her breathing slows further. Becomes shallow. Becomes quiet.

Zara is still holding her hand.

Wei takes one more breath.

Releases it.

Doesn't take another.

Professor Mei-Lin Wei dies on a Tuesday afternoon in Lagos. One hundred twenty-three years old. Natural death. Peaceful.

Before the asteroid. Individual, not collective.

She lived a full life. Taught thousands. Loved deeply. Found peace with impermanence.

She died ready.

###

Zara buries her in the garden, under the lemon tree. Maya and Kofi help dig. Help plant flowers on the grave. Help say goodbye.

It's their first death. Not their last. But their first.

Wei would say: Good. Learn now. Practice for what comes.

The garden continues. The flowers bloom and fade. The seasons turn.

And Wei's teachings live on. In Zara. In Kenji. In Elena. In everyone she touched.

Not immortality. Just: influence. Connection. Memory.

Temporary and perfect.

Like everything else.
