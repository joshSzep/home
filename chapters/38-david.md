# Chapter 38: David

Year 15. Final weeks. David Chen climbs platform 73—two hundred meters above Antarctica, solar arrays stretching in all directions, robot 47B working beside him.

He's fifty-four years old. Maintained these systems for thirty years. Will maintain them until the end. Few more days. Maybe hours.

The work continues. The robots continue. The arrays continue. Generating power for two thousand people. For infrastructure failing gracefully. For civilization's last breath.

Why still maintain? David asked himself this for fifteen years. No good answer. Just: someone should. Something should persist until it can't.

That's enough.

Has to be.

Below, Antarctica. Above, sky. Between, human and machine working together. Present until the end.

Robot 47B completes circuit repair. Chirps affirmation. Moves to next task. It doesn't know the asteroid's coming. Doesn't know anything except: maintain function. Repair damage. Continue protocol.

Simple. Pure. Honest.

David envies this sometimes. The not knowing. The pure function without meaning-making. Just: work that needs doing.

But knowing is burden and gift both. Burden: you see the ending. Gift: you choose how to face it.

David chose work. And Amara. And family. And presence.

Not bad choices.

Not perfect.

But real.

---

Morning. Maya climbs the platform.

Amara's niece. Seventeen years old. Brilliant. About to die. Wants to understand the solar arrays.

"Uncle David," she says. Breathless from climb. Excited. "Can you show me how they work?"

Uncle David. He's only been uncle for few weeks. But: accepts it. Grateful for it. Family by choice if not blood.

"Of course," he says. "Come. Carefully. Platform's safe but wind's strong."

They walk the arrays together. David explains: photovoltaic cells, power conversion, grid integration, automated maintenance protocols. Maya absorbs everything—her mother's intelligence, her father's precision.

"They'll outlast us," Maya says. "Won't they? The arrays. The robots. They'll keep functioning after we're gone."

"Few seconds, maybe. Asteroid destroys everything. But yes—until impact, they'll work. They don't know they're dying."

"Is that better? Not knowing?"

"Different. We know. They don't. Neither is better. Both are valid."

"Professor Wei said consciousness is curse and blessing. Curse: we suffer knowing. Blessing: we choose how to face what we know."

"She sounds wise."

"She was. Died before I could meet her. But her teaching continues. Through Mama. Through Kenji. Through everyone she touched."

They stand on the platform. Two hundred meters up. Wind whipping cold. Arrays stretching endlessly.

"What will you do?" Maya asks. "At the end? Will you be up here?"

"Yes. Amara and I. We'll witness from this platform. Together. Clear view. Working systems around us. Seems right."

"Because the work mattered?"

"Because presence matters. The work gave me structure. But Amara gives meaning. Both together: that's everything."

Maya nods. "I'm glad you reconnected. Mama says you were apart for ten years. That must have hurt."

"It did. We both hid. Different ways. Same fear. But: we came back. That's what matters."

"Five years together. After ten years apart. Is it enough?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They stand in comfortable silence. Uncle and niece. Engineer and student. Both facing the end with presence.

"Thank you," Maya says. "For showing me. For teaching me. For being here."

"Thank you for climbing up. For being curious. For existing despite everything."

Maya smiles—sad, beautiful, brief. Seventeen years old. Few days left. Still learning. Still curious. Still present.

She descended carefully. David watches her go. Thinks: Zara chose life. Chose that girl. Against all advice. Against all fear. Chose defiance.

Brave. So brave.

He returns to work. Robot 47B beside him. Maintaining systems that die in days.

Meaningless and meaningful. Both true.

---

Afternoon. Kofi arrives with Kwame.

The boy is thirteen. Bright-eyed. Energetic. Wants to climb everything.

"Uncle David! Can I help? Can I climb? Can I touch the robots?"

Kwame looks apologetic. "He's been asking all week. I said we had to get permission first."

"Of course he can help," David says. "Supervised. Carefully. But yes. Come, Kofi. I'll show you."

They climb together. Kwame following. Three people ascending platform 73. Family time disguised as work time. Or: work time made meaningful by family.

Both true. Always both.

David shows Kofi the simple tasks. Checking connections. Reading displays. Monitoring robot protocols. The boy absorbs everything. Asks thousand questions.

"Why do robots work if everyone's dying?"

"They don't know we're dying. They just know: maintain function. That's their purpose."

"Do they have feelings?"

"No. Just protocols. Instructions. They execute without emotion."

"Is that sad?"

"Different. Not sad or happy. Just: different way of being."

Kofi touches robot 47B carefully. It continues working, unaware. Boy and machine. One conscious, one not. Both here. Both real.

"I like them," Kofi says. "They're honest. They just do what they do."

"Exactly. No pretense. No meaning-making. Just: function."

"Is that what you do? Just function?"

David considers. "Used to. For years after detection, I just functioned. Like the robots. Meaningless continuation. But last five years: no. Now I function with presence. With Amara. With purpose. That's different."

"What changed?"

"Amara woke up. Invited me to wake up too. We wasted ten years. Didn't waste five more. That changed everything."

"Five years is a lot."

"Is it? I don't know. But it's real. It's what we have. That's enough."

Kofi nods. Continues exploring. Kwame watches his son with fierce love—knowing the boy dies in days. Knowing he can't prevent it. Knowing all he can do is be present.

Zara taught him that. Through example. Through choosing life anyway. Through loving despite knowing.

"Thank you," Kwame says quietly to David. "For including him. For teaching him. For making him feel like he matters."

"He does matter. You all matter. That's why you're here. That's why Amara invited you. Family matters. Presence matters. That's everything."

They work together. Man, man, boy, robots. All maintaining systems that end soon. All present anyway. All mattering now.

---

Evening. David and Amara sit in their small house.

Zara's family is with Elena and Kenji. Community gathering. Final weeks. People converging. Loving fiercely.

David and Amara chose quiet evening. Just them. Tea. Silence. Twenty-two years of marriage. Ten years broken. Five years healed. Days left.

"I love watching you with Maya and Kofi," Amara says. "You're so good with them. Patient. Present. I didn't know you were good with children."

"Neither did I. Never had chance. But: they're easy to love. They're honest. Present. Curious. Everything that matters."

"Do you regret not having children? Us?"

David considers honestly. "Sometimes. When I see Zara with them. When I see how much they matter to her. But: no. Not really. We had other things. Work. Each other. Eventually. That was enough."

"Was it? After I withdrew for ten years? Was I enough?"

"You were absent. That hurt. But when you came back—yes. You were enough. You are enough. These five years: everything."

Amara cries. Not first time. Not last. Grief and gratitude tangled.

"I wasted so much time," she says. "Ten years hiding. We could have had fifteen years together. Instead: five."

"Five is real. Five is what we have. That's enough."

"Is it? Really? Will we die feeling like we lived enough?"

"I don't know. But we're trying. We're present. We're loving. What else can we do?"

They sit in silence. Holding hands. Two people who broke. Who healed. Who face the end together.

"David," Amara says. "Will you be scared? When it comes?"

"Probably. But present. Fear doesn't prevent presence. Nothing prevents presence except not being."

"Wei said that?"

"No. But she taught it. Through Kenji. Through Zara. Through everyone. The teaching spread. We all learned."

"I'm glad. I'm glad you learned. I'm glad we both learned. Better late than never."

"Much better."

They finish tea. Prepare for bed. Last week of sleeping. Last week of waking. Last week of being David and Amara Chen, married, healed, present.

Then: together at the end.

But present now.

Always present now.

---

Next day, David writes final maintenance log.

Not required. Systems are automated. But: habit. Documentation. Bearing witness.

*Year 15, Day 358. Systems functioning at 94% capacity. Minor degradation in sectors 7, 12, 23. Automated repair protocols engaging. Robot fleet operating within parameters. Power generation sufficient for remaining population. Estimated functionality: until impact plus 2.3 seconds.*

*Personal note: Maintained these systems for thirty years. They will outlast me by seconds. This seems right. We worked together—me and machines—maintaining function when function seemed meaningless. But function was never meaningless. It was presence. It was bearing witness. It was saying: while we're here, we maintain. We persist. We care.*

*Final log. Systems will continue without me. For 2.3 seconds. Then: silence.*

*It was enough.*

*—David Chen, Senior Maintenance Engineer, Solar Division*

He saves the file. For whom? No one. The AI will record it. Store it. Then: die with everything else.

But someone should document. Someone should say: we maintained. We cared. We were here.

That someone was David.

Thirty years of maintenance. Of showing up. Of working alongside machines that don't know they're dying.

Not wasted. Never wasted. Just: presence disguised as work.

Enough.

---

Days pass. The asteroid approaches.

David continues working. Not from duty. From presence. From choice. From love of the work that gave him structure when everything else fell apart.

Maya visits daily. Learning everything. Absorbing knowledge she'll never use. But: curiosity matters. Understanding matters. Being interested matters even when there's no future.

Kofi climbs the platforms. Laughs in the wind. Plays with robots like they're friends. Thirteen years old. Few days left. Still finding joy.

David watches him and learns. From child. From presence. From acceptance that comes easier to someone who never knew the world before.

One evening, whole family gathers on platform 73.

Amara and David. Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi. Six people. Two hundred meters up. Wind cold. Sky clear. Asteroid invisible but approaching.

"Why here?" Kofi asks. "Why do you want to be up here at the end?"

David answers: "Because this is where I worked. Where I persisted. Where I maintained systems alongside machines. It feels right to witness from here. With Amara. With work that mattered even when it seemed meaningless."

"Did it matter?" Maya asks. "The work? If everything ends?"

"Yes. Because mattering isn't about outcomes. It's about presence. I was present. For thirty years. That mattered."

"To who?"

"To me. To Amara. To the robots who worked beside me. To anyone who used the power these arrays generated. To the idea that maintaining is holy work even when nothing lasts."

Zara says: "Wei taught that. Maintenance as meditation. Presence as purpose. You embodied it."

"I didn't know I was embodying anything. I was just: showing up. Working. Continuing. But yes—that's presence. That's enough."

They stand together. Six people. Two hundred meters up. Systems humming. Robots working. Sky clear.

"I'm glad you'll be here," Maya says. "You and Aunt Amara. Together. With your work. That's beautiful."

"Where will you be?" David asks.

"In the preserve," Zara says. "All four of us. With nature. With beauty. With each other. That's where we belong."

"Perfect. Different locations. Same moment. All witnesses."

They descend together. Family time. Final days. Presence continuing.

---

Final night before the end, David and Amara climb platform 73 one last time.

Not to work. To prepare. To sit. To be together in the place that mattered.

They bring chairs. Blankets. Tea. Each other.

The systems hum around them. Robots working through the night. Maintaining protocols. Unaware tomorrow everything ends.

"They'll keep working," Amara says. "Until impact. They don't know to stop."

"Neither do I," David says. "I'll probably want to check one more connection. Verify one more repair. Even knowing it doesn't matter."

"It matters because you care. That's everything."

They sit in silence. Two hundred meters up. Clear view. Antarctica stretching forever. Sky full of stars. Asteroid invisible among them.

"David," Amara says. "Thank you. For waiting. For not leaving when I withdrew. For being here when I woke up. For these five years."

"Thank you for waking up. For inviting me to wake too. For bringing your family. For loving me despite everything."

"I always loved you. Even when I was hiding. I just forgot how to show it."

"I know. I always knew."

They hold hands. Two people who married young. Who worked together. Who broke apart. Who healed. Who face the end together.

"Are you ready?" Amara asks.

"No. But present. That's all I can be."

"That's enough."

"Is it? Really?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They sit through the night. Watching robots work. Watching systems function. Watching stars wheel overhead. One of those stars: approaching. Invisible. Inevitable. True.

Dawn breaks. Final dawn. Last morning. Hours left.

Below, people moving. Gathering. Choosing locations. Choosing companions. Everyone converging on final moments.

Zara's family heading to preserve. Elena and Kenji to community center. Ibrahim with them. All together. All choosing presence.

David and Amara stay on platform 73. Two hundred meters up. With work. With systems. With each other.

"I love you," David says.

"I love you too. Always. To the end."

Robot 47B completes final repair. Chirps affirmation. Continues protocol. Unaware. Faithful. Present.

The arrays hum. The systems function. The power flows.

For hours more. Then: silence.

But present now.

Working now.

Loving now.

David and Amara. Together. Two hundred meters up. With machines that don't know they're dying. With work that mattered because presence mattered.

Enough.

Always enough.

The maintenance continues.

The witness continues.

The love continues.

For hours more.

Then—

But present now.

Always present now.

David holds Amara's hand.

The robots work beside them.

The systems hum.

The sky brightens.

Hours left.

Then together.

But present now.

Always.

Present.

Now.

Enough.

The work was holy.

The presence was real.

The love was everything.

David knows this.

Finally.

Completely.

To the end.

The maintenance engineer and his wife.

Two hundred meters up.

Bearing witness.

Together.

Enough.

Always enough.

Forever enough.

For hours more.

Then—

Present now.

Always.

Now.
