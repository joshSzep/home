# Chapter 34: Elena

Year 11. Elena Torres, Mayor of McMurdo District, sits in her office at dawn.

Empty office. No staff. No petitioners. No governance. Just: habit.

She arrives every morning. Unlocks the door. Turns on lights (when power works). Sits at her desk. Opens files no one needs. Maintains records no one will read.

Why?

She's asked herself this question for years. Since Year 5, since Year 7, since Year 10 when Kenji returned and asked: "Mother, why do you still come here?"

Her answer then: "Because someone should."

Her answer now: the same. But understood differently. Not duty to society. Duty to... what? Dignity? Presence? The idea that bearing witness matters even when nothing matters?

Wei understood this. Wrote to Elena Year 10, shortly before her death:

*You govern with dignity even when there's nothing to govern. This is wisdom. Not governing outcomes—governing yourself. Being present in your role until the end. This is enough.*

Elena never met Wei. But the philosopher became, strangely, one of her most important teachers. Through letters. Through Kenji's stories. Through the simple act of living with intention until natural death.

Elena is sixty-five years old. Four years until the asteroid. Governing nothing but still governing.

Present until the end.

That's enough.

Has to be.

---

Morning routine: check systems.

Power: intermittent. Backup generators failing. Solar arrays—David and Amara's work—still functioning. Barely. Few more years maybe.

Water: reclamation systems degrading. Clean water for four years. Maybe.

Food: greenhouse yields declining. Supplements from storage. Enough for four years. Probably.

Population: 1,847 people. Down from 3,000 Year 1. Some left (went where?). Some died. Some just... stopped registering. Hard to track when society's dissolving.

Elena updates the records. Types carefully. Dates everything. Includes weather (minus-forty Celsius, wind thirty knots), observations (three more buildings abandoned this week), notes (Kowalski's restaurant closed—owner said no point anymore).

She saves the file. For whom? No one. Just: someone should document this. Someone should say: we were here. We persisted. We mattered.

Even if we didn't.

Even if we don't.

We tried.

---

Midmorning, Kenji arrives with tea.

Her son. Thirty-eight years old. Returned to Antarctica Year 10, stayed. Works with her now. Not governing—bearing witness together.

"Morning, Mother," he says. Hands her tea. Sits across from her desk.

They've healed, these past years. The distance. The grief. The different ways of coping. All healed. Or: accepted. Same thing, maybe.

"How's the district?" Kenji asks.

"Failing. Gracefully."

"Is there graceful failing?"

"We're proving there is. Most systems down. But people help each other. Share resources. Form communities. No central authority needed anymore. They're doing it themselves."

"So your job's obsolete."

"Was always obsolete. Post-detection, what's a mayor? Symbolic only. Theater of governance. But: the theater mattered. Gave people structure, familiarity, sense that someone was witnessing."

"And now?"

"Now they don't need the theater. They've learned to be present without it. Which means: I succeeded. Or failed. Depending on perspective."

Kenji smiles. "Wei would say both are true."

"Wei was wise."

"You never met her."

"No. But I loved her anyway. Through your stories. Through her letters. She understood what I'm trying to do. Not govern—just witness. Be present. Maintain dignity to the end."

They drink tea. Sit in comfortable silence. Outside, McMurdo District continues its slow collapse. Inside, mother and son persist together.

"I'm glad you came back," Elena says quietly.

"I'm glad I did too."

"I'm sorry I wasn't more present. When you were young. After your father died."

"You were grieving. Doing the best you could."

"Still. I hid in work. Just like Amara hid in work. We're similar that way."

"And now you're both here. Present. That's what matters."

Elena nods. Looks at her son. He's thin, weathered, peaceful. The desperate seeking stopped. The presence achieved. Wei's teaching embodied.

"Thank you," Elena says. "For coming back. For staying. For helping me understand that presence is enough."

"You taught me that too. Different way than Wei. But same lesson. You kept showing up. Kept bearing witness. Kept governing nothing with dignity. That's presence."

"Is it enough?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They finish tea. Continue the day's pointless, essential work.

---

Afternoon, Elena walks the district.

Monthly ritual. Visiting different sectors. Checking in. Not governing—just: being seen. Bearing witness. Reminding people someone's paying attention.

Fewer people each month. But some remain. Determined. Persistent. Human.

She stops at the greenhouse. Dr. Yamamoto's still maintaining it. Seventy-three years old, hunched from years of work, gentle with the plants.

"Mayor Torres," he says. "Good to see you."

"How are the plants?"

"Declining. Soil's exhausted. No more nutrients. I'm coaxing what I can. Few more seasons. Then: nothing."

"But you keep coming."

"Someone should tend them. They're alive. They deserve care."

Elena helps him water. They work in silence. The greenhouse is warm, humid, alive. Four years from now: dead. But present now. Growing now. Mattering now.

"Dr. Yamamoto," Elena says. "Why do you think we keep doing this? The maintenance? The care? When we know how it ends?"

He considers. "Because the plants don't know. They're just being plants. Someone should honor that."

"Is that enough reason?"

"Only reason there is."

They finish watering. Elena thanks him. Continues walking.

---

Evening, Ibrahim visits.

The former fighter, faithless now but not angry. Learning to live with uncertainty. He's become—surprisingly—one of Elena's closest friends.

They sit in her small apartment. Simple dinner. Conversation.

"How was your day?" Ibrahim asks.

"Symbolic. Yours?"

"Also symbolic. Fixed pipes that will break in months. Attended services I don't believe in. Wrote in journal no one will read."

"Why do you keep attending services?"

"Trying to understand what I lost. What others still have. Why humans need meaning-making rituals."

"Have you understood?"

"Some. People believe because connection matters. Because tradition matters. Because having structure helps face the end. Not because they think they're saved. Just: because ritual helps."

Elena nods. "That's what governance was. Ritual. Structure. Theater of meaning. Helped people cope."

"Did it work?"

"For a while. Until they learned to cope without it. Then: my job ended. But I kept coming anyway. Because witnessing matters. Even if no one needs it."

"Who are you witnessing for?"

"Myself, maybe. The idea of civilization. The people who built this place thinking it would last. I'm saying: it didn't last forever, but it lasted. That counts."

Ibrahim considers this. "In Islam, we have concept: bearing witness. *Shahada*. Testifying that truth exists. You're doing this. Secular version."

"I'm not religious."

"I know. But you have faith. Just: different object. Faith in duty, in dignity, in presence. That's still faith."

"I never thought of it that way."

"Neither did I. Until I lost my faith. Then I saw: everyone has faith in something. God, duty, love, presence, uncertainty. We're all believers. Just: different beliefs."

They eat in silence. Two people who found unexpected friendship facing the end together. Different paths. Same destination. Same insistence on dignity.

Night, Elena writes in her official record.

*Year 11, Day 247.*

*Population: 1,847 (estimate—hard to track). Systems failing across district. Power 60% capacity. Water 70%. Food sufficient for four years. Infrastructure degrading faster than predicted.*

*But: people persist. Form communities. Help neighbors. Share resources. The governance structure is obsolete. They've learned to organize themselves. This is success or failure—I can't tell anymore.*

*Kenji says both are true. Wei taught him that. I believe him.*

*Four years left. I'll continue documenting. Bearing witness. Maintaining presence. Not because it achieves anything. Because someone should say: we were here. We mattered. We maintained dignity to nearly the end.*

*That's enough.*

*Has to be.*

She saves the file. Closes the system. Sits in darkness.

Outside, Antarctica howls. Inside, Elena breathes. Sixty-five years old. Four years until ending. Life spent in service to civilization that won't last.

Was it wasted?

No. Because the serving mattered. The presence mattered. The dignity mattered.

Outcome doesn't determine meaning. Being does.

Wei taught that. Kenji embodies it. Elena lives it.

For four more years.

Then: together with everyone. Kenji. Ibrahim. Amara and David. Zara's family arriving soon. All facing it together.

That's everything.

That's enough.

---

Year 12. Zara's letter arrives.

*Mayor Torres,*

*I'm Amara's sister. She invited us to Antarctica. We're coming—me, my husband Kwame, our children Maya (14) and Kofi (11). Should arrive Year 13 if transport holds.*

*Amara says you've maintained governance with dignity to the end. That you kept showing up when others stopped. That you still bear witness.*

*Thank you for that. Someone should. Someone should say: we were here.*

*We're bringing children to the end. Hardest thing I've ever done. But: they should be with family. We should face it together.*

*Looking forward to meeting you. Amara speaks highly of you. So does Kenji.*

*With respect,  
Zara Okafor-Mensah*

Elena reads the letter three times. Cries. Grateful.

Family coming. Sisters reuniting. Children—last generation. All converging on Antarctica for the end.

This is what governance becomes: welcoming people home. Making space for final gatherings. Bearing witness to love persisting.

Not policy. Not power. Just: presence.

She writes back:

*Zara,*

*Welcome. There's room here. For all of you. For everyone who comes.*

*I'll help coordinate housing, resources, welcome. Not governance—just: making space for people to be together at the end.*

*Your children will meet others. Small community. They'll learn, play, be. For three more years. Then: together.*

*Amara's lucky to have you coming. I'm lucky to witness it.*

*See you Year 13.*

*With warmth,  
Elena Torres*

She sends it. Doesn't know if it arrives. Networks failing. But: tried.

---

One morning, Kenji finds Elena laughing in her office.

She's reading old documents. Founding statements from Antarctica's establishment. Year 2990, fifty years ago. Architects, engineers, politicians declaring: *We build Forever Earth's southern city. May it last ten thousand years.*

"Mother? What's funny?"

"They built for ten thousand years. We get fifty. Then: nothing."

Kenji sits. Reads. Starts laughing too. Then crying. Then laughing again.

"Forever is three years," he says.

"Always was. We just didn't see it."

They sit together, crying and laughing and breathing. Mother and son. Witnessing civilization's end with tears and absurdity and love.

"Was it worth it?" Kenji asks. "All your years governing? If it ends in three years?"

Elena considers. "Yes. Because the governing was real. The people were real. The attempt was real. Outcome doesn't determine meaning. Being does."

"Wei said that."

"Wei was right."

"You would have liked her."

"I did like her. Even though we never met. Love doesn't require presence. Just: connection."

They continue reading. Laughing. Grieving. Witnessing together.

---

Three years left.

Elena continues her morning routine. Office. Records. Presence.

Fewer people each day. Systems failing faster. But: she shows up.

One morning, the power dies completely. Backup generators finally failed. David and Amara's solar arrays can't support the whole district.

Elena sits in dark office. Writes by hand:

*Year 12, Day 312. Power failed. This may be the last record on the system. Continuing by hand.*

*Three years left. I'll continue bearing witness. Recording what happens. Who's here. How we persist.*

*Not for future. There is no future. Just: because someone should say: we were here. We mattered. We maintained dignity to the end.*

*I think of Hiroshi. My husband. Dead twenty years. I'll see him soon. Or I won't. But I loved him. That was real.*

*I think of Kenji. My son. Here with me. Healed relationship. Presence instead of distance. That was real.*

*I think of everyone persisting. Fighting. Surrendering. Finding meaning. Losing meaning. Bearing witness.*

*All real.*

*All enough.*

*Three years left.*

*I'll be present for them.*

*That's my duty.*

*That's my choice.*

*That's enough.*

She closes the journal. Sits in darkness. Listens to Antarctica breathing.

Kenji knocks. Enters. Sits beside her.

"Power's out," he says.

"I know."

"What do we do?"

"Keep showing up. Keep bearing witness. Keep being present."

"Is that enough?"

"Has to be. What else is there?"

They sit together in the dark. Mother and son. Bearing witness. Present to the end.

Outside, civilization collapses. Inside, two people persist.

Not governing. Not achieving. Not saving.

Just: being here. Bearing witness. Maintaining dignity.

For three more years.

Then: together with everyone.

That's enough.

Always was.

Always will be.

Elena breathes. Kenji breathes. Antarctica breathes.

Present now.

Witnessing now.

Enough now.

Three years left.

Then—

But not yet.

Present now.

Always present now.

That's everything.

That's enough.

The darkness holds them.

The witness continues.

The dignity persists.

Three more years.

Then: together.

Elena smiles in the darkness.

Kenji holds her hand.

They breathe.

They witness.

They are.

Enough.

Always enough.

To the end.
