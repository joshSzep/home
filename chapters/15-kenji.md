# Chapter 15 - Kenji

The temple smells like incense and time.

Kenji Torres sits cross-legged on a meditation cushion, trying to empty his mind. Around him, Buddhist monks chant morning prayers. The sound is hypnotic, ancient, meant to lead to enlightenment.

He feels nothing.

This is his third week at the Lagos temple. Before that, two months at a Hindu ashram in Mumbai. Before that, six months drifting through different spiritual communities across Africa and Asia.

Searching. Always searching.

For what? Meaning. Purpose. A way to live fifteen years that isn't numbing out or drowning in despair.

So far: nothing.

The Buddhist monks tell him about impermanence and non-attachment. Let go of craving. Accept that nothing lasts. Find peace in emptiness.

It makes intellectual sense. But Kenji can't feel it. Can't internalize it. Can't transform philosophy into lived experience.

Maybe he's broken. Maybe some people just can't find meaning in a meaningless universe.

The morning prayers end. The monks file out. Kenji remains on his cushion, staring at nothing.

An older monk—the one who's been guiding his practice—sits beside him.

"You are struggling."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"I don't know. I'm trying to let go. Trying to accept impermanence. Trying to find peace. But I just feel... empty."

"Empty is good. Empty is the goal."

"No, not that kind of empty. Hollow empty. Like I'm going through motions but nothing's real."

The monk is quiet for a moment. "Perhaps you are trying too hard. Seeking enlightenment is the obstacle to enlightenment. The grasping itself is the problem."

"So I should stop seeking?"

"Can you?"

Kenji thinks about it. Can he stop seeking? Stop traveling? Stop asking questions? Stop trying to find the answer to how to live fifteen years?

"I don't know."

"Then that is your answer. When you are ready to stop seeking, you will stop. Until then, seek. But know that what you seek is already here."

"Where?"

The monk smiles. "Everywhere. Nowhere. Here." He taps Kenji's chest. "You carry it with you. But you are looking outside yourself."

The monk leaves. Kenji sits alone in the temple.

*What you seek is already here.*

He doesn't believe that. But he doesn't know what else to do.

So he keeps traveling.

---

Mumbai is overwhelming.

The megacity is louder than Lagos, more crowded, more intense. Kenji stays at an ashram on the outskirts—a Hindu community dedicated to devotional practice and selfless service.

*Bhakti yoga.* The path of devotion. Surrender to the divine. Love God completely and you'll find peace.

Kenji tries. He really does.

He attends the prayers. Learns the chants. Studies the scriptures. Helps cook meals for the poor. Tries to feel devotion to something, anything.

But he can't force faith.

Can't make himself believe in Krishna or Shiva or any deity watching over humanity. Can't surrender to a divine plan when the divine plan involves everyone dying in twelve years.

The ashram leader—a woman with gray hair and kind eyes—tells him: "Faith is a gift. You cannot force it. It either comes or it doesn't."

"What if it doesn't come? What do I do then?"

"Then you find another path. Faith is one way. Not the only way."

"What are the other ways?"

"That's what you're trying to discover. Keep searching. You'll find your path eventually."

Kenji stays at the ashram for two months. Learns a lot about Hinduism. Meets beautiful people with genuine faith. Respects them deeply.

But it's not his path.

He leaves Mumbai and continues traveling.

---

Jerusalem is burning.

Not literally—not today. But the wars are intensifying. Every faction fighting harder, more desperately. Everyone convinced the holy land matters. Everyone killing each other over ground that will be vaporized.

Kenji shouldn't be here. His mother sent three messages warning him away. The UN designated the region high-risk. Smart people are leaving, not arriving.

But Kenji came anyway. Because if he's trying to understand how humans find meaning, he needs to understand faith. And Jerusalem is where faith lives—Christian, Muslim, Jewish, all converging on the same contested ground.

He stays in a refugee camp on the outskirts. Talks to anyone who'll talk. Christians who believe Jesus will return before the asteroid. Muslims who believe Allah's will is being enacted. Jews who believe this is part of God's plan.

Everyone has absolute certainty about completely different things.

Kenji envies the certainty even as he knows it's false.

One evening, he meets a young fighter. Palestinian, maybe twenty-two, with eyes that have seen too much.

"You're the seeker," the fighter says. Not a question.

"That's what people call me."

"What are you seeking?"

"A reason to live twelve years. A way to make meaning when nothing means what it used to mean."

The fighter studies him. "I'm Ibrahim. I used to know exactly what mattered. Now I don't know anything."

They start talking. Find unexpected connection. Ibrahim, the fighter losing faith. Kenji, the seeker unable to find it. Two people on opposite journeys, meeting in the middle.

They spend hours talking over the next two months. Philosophy, faith, doubt, meaning. How to live without certainty. How to be human when the universe is indifferent.

"You're looking for faith," Ibrahim says one evening. "Trying every religion, every philosophy. But you can't find it because you don't actually want it. You want understanding. That's different."

"What's the difference?"

"Faith doesn't require understanding. Faith is surrender. Trust without proof. You can't surrender. You need to know. Need to understand. That's not faith. That's philosophy."

Kenji realizes Ibrahim is right. He's been trying to find faith because he thinks it will give him peace. But he can't force himself to believe in things he doesn't believe.

"So what do I do?"

"Stop trying to believe. Accept that you don't. Find meaning anyway. Without God, without certainty, without faith. Just: decide what matters and live accordingly."

"How do you decide?"

"I don't know. I'm trying to figure that out too."

---

Three weeks after that conversation, Kenji witnesses his first death.

Not the asteroid death—individual death. Someone shot in the street during a skirmish. Christian militiaman, maybe thirty years old. Shot through the chest.

Kenji and Ibrahim help carry him to cover. Try to stop the bleeding. Can't. The man dies in minutes, looking confused and scared.

Ibrahim prays over him. Christian prayer, not Muslim—showing respect for the dead even though they were enemies.

Afterward, sitting in the rubble, Kenji asks: "Do you really believe he's going to heaven?"

"No."

"But you prayed."

"Because he believed. Because he died believing there was something after. Because even if I don't believe, I can honor that he did."

"That's kind."

"Maybe. Or maybe it's cowardice. I can't believe anymore, but I can't fully let go either. I'm stuck in the middle."

"Me too."

They sit together watching smoke rise from the holy land. Two seekers who can't find what they're looking for. Two doubters who can't force faith.

But there's something in the friendship itself. In the connection. In the honesty.

Maybe that matters. Maybe connection is its own kind of meaning.

Not enough to answer all the questions. But something.

---

Kenji stays in Jerusalem for three months total.

Watches the wars escalate. Watches people kill each other with absolute certainty. Watches faith drive people to violence, to martyrdom, to death.

He learns something important: he doesn't want certainty if certainty leads to this. If absolute faith means being willing to kill for it, he'd rather have doubt.

Doubt is honest. Doubt admits limits. Doubt leaves room for other people's truth.

He respects the faithful—respects Ibrahim's former certainty, respects the Christians and Jews and Muslims who believe deeply. Respects the power of faith to give meaning and structure and purpose.

But he can't have it himself.

And maybe that's okay.

One evening, he tells Ibrahim he's leaving.

"Where?"

"Back to Lagos. There's a philosopher there. Professor Wei. Ancient woman, supposedly wise. Someone told me about her a year ago. I'm going to find her. Try to learn from her."

"What if she doesn't have answers either?"

"Then at least I'll have tried. And Ibrahim—" Kenji puts his hand on his friend's shoulder. "You should leave too. This war is meaningless. You know it. Stop fighting for holy ground that'll be destroyed."

"I know. I'm trying to figure out how to stop being a fighter. Not there yet."

"When you are, find me. Antarctica eventually. Or Lagos if I'm still there. We'll figure this out together."

"Together doesn't sound so bad."

They embrace. Brothers in doubt. Friends in the dark.

Kenji leaves Jerusalem the next day.

Behind him, the wars continue. The faithful keep fighting. The certainty persists.

Ahead of him, Lagos. Professor Wei. More questions, probably. But maybe different questions.

Maybe better ones.

---

The journey back to Lagos takes two weeks.

Transport systems are degrading. Fewer flights. Longer waits. Everything breaking down slowly.

Kenji uses the time to think.

Two years of traveling. Buddhist temples, Hindu ashrams, Christian churches, Islamic mosques, secular philosophy groups. He's tried everything. Listened to everyone.

What has he learned?

That no one has *the* answer. Everyone has *an* answer. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, humanism—they're all tools. Different ways of making meaning in a meaningless universe.

Some people need certainty. Some people need surrender. Some people need community. Some people need philosophy.

Kenji doesn't know what he needs yet. But he's learning what he doesn't need.

He doesn't need absolute faith. Can't force it, wouldn't want it if he could.

He doesn't need certainty. Prefers honest doubt to false confidence.

He doesn't need religion, exactly. But he needs something. Tools. Frameworks. Ways of being present without drowning in despair.

Maybe Professor Wei will have those tools.

Or maybe she'll just have more questions.

Either way, it's the next step.

---

Lagos feels like coming home even though it's not home.

Kenji returns to the neighborhood where he stayed months ago. Finds the woman at the market who first told him about Professor Wei.

"You came back."

"I'm looking for Professor Wei. Can you tell me how to find her?"

The woman gives him directions. Warns him: "She's very old. Very frail. Doesn't teach formally. But if she agrees to talk with you, listen carefully. She doesn't waste words."

Kenji finds the house in the Yaba District. Small, modest, garden out front. An old woman sits on a bench—impossibly small, white hair, bright eyes.

He approaches carefully. "Professor Wei?"

She looks up. Studies him. "You're the seeker. Elena Torres's son."

"How do you—"

"Your mother and I correspond. She worries about you. Said you were traveling, asking questions, looking for teachers." Wei gestures at the bench. "Sit."

Kenji sits.

A little girl runs past—maybe four years old, chasing a butterfly.

"That's Maya," Wei says. "Her mother Zara lives next door. Maya will die at seventeen. Her brother Kofi at fourteen. Their mother knows this. Still loves them completely. Still raises them with joy. That's meaning-making."

Kenji watches the little girl play. Pure presence. Pure wonder. Completely absorbed in the moment.

"I've been traveling for two years," he says. "Trying to find a way to live fifteen years. Trying to find meaning. I've tried Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam. Nothing works. I can't force faith. Can't surrender. Can't stop questioning."

"Good."

"Good?"

"You've learned what you don't need. That's progress. Most people waste lifetimes clinging to certainty they don't have. You let go of that quickly. Now you can learn what you do need."

"What do I need?"

"Tools. Not answers. Tools for being present. For accepting impermanence. For making meaning consciously instead of inheriting it. For living without certainty but also without drowning in meaninglessness."

"Can you teach me?"

Wei smiles. "I'm one hundred sixteen years old. I don't teach anymore. Too tired. But you can visit. We can talk. I'll share what I've learned. You take what's useful. Leave the rest."

"Why would you do that?"

"Because you're asking honestly. Because your mother is my friend. Because I have maybe five years left and I'd like to share what I know. Because watching seekers learn is satisfying." She pauses. "And because you remind me of myself at your age. Before I found my own tools. When I was lost and searching and desperate."

"Did you find what you were looking for?"

"No. I learned to stop looking. That's different. Better, actually."

Kenji feels something crack in his chest. Not breaking. Opening.

"Can I come back tomorrow?"

"Yes. Mornings are best. My energy fades by afternoon."

He starts to leave, then turns back. "Professor Wei? Thank you."

"Thank me after you've learned something. Right now you've just arrived."

Kenji walks back to his hostel feeling lighter than he has in two years.

Not because he found the answer. Because he found a teacher who admits there isn't one.

Who'll teach him to be okay with that.

To live anyway.

To make meaning anyway.

That's enough.

That's exactly what he needs.

Tomorrow, the real learning begins.
