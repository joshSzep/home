# PART II: FRACTURE

# Chapter 5 - Life Choices

The numbers don't lie.

Amara has run the calculations forty-seven times. Different approaches, different models, different assumptions. The result is always the same.

The asteroid—officially designated 2025-AZ1 in the UN database, though everyone just calls it "the asteroid" now—cannot be stopped. Not with current technology. Not with theoretical technology. Not with anything humans could build in fifteen years.

Physics doesn't care about human survival.

Six weeks after detection, she presents to the UN emergency summit. Representatives from every space-capable nation and corporation, all desperate for solutions. For hope wrapped in technical jargon.

Amara gives them truth instead.

"The asteroid is fifteen kilometers in diameter. Velocity: 28.3 kilometers per second. Impact probability: 99.97%." She pulls up the deflection analysis. "To successfully deflect an object of this size and velocity would require changing its trajectory by approximately 0.5 degrees. This sounds small. It is not."

She clicks through the scenarios. Kinetic impactor: would require spacecraft ten times more massive than anything humanity had ever built. Nuclear deflection: insufficient yield even with Earth's entire arsenal. Gravity tractor: would need fifty years minimum. They have fifteen.

"None of these can be built, deployed, and executed in the available timeframe."

The Chinese representative speaks first. "You're saying there's no chance."

"I'm saying the probability of successful deflection is below 0.1%. Effectively zero."

"Below 0.1% is not zero."

Amara meets his eyes. "No. But it's close enough that pursuing it would waste the time we have left."

The room erupts. Shouting. Accusations. Someone calls her a defeatist. The Russian representative leaves.

Finally, the Secretary General raises his hand. "Dr. Okafor. Are you absolutely certain?"

"Yes."

She pulls up the final slide. Impact simulations. Pacific Ocean impact site. Fireball radius. Shock wave propagation. "The explosion will be equivalent to roughly 400 million megatons of TNT. Every coastline destroyed within hours. Impact winter lasting months. Photosynthesis ceases. Human extinction follows within twelve to eighteen months of impact."

She looks at the assembled faces. "I'm sorry. But this is what the physics tells us. It cannot be stopped."

The meeting ends. No solutions. No hope. Just math.

Amara goes back to her workstation and updates the countdown. 14 years, 11 months, 11 days.

Then 10 days.

Then 9.

The countdown never stops. Neither does she.

###

Three hundred kilometers north, in Lagos District, Zara sees the statistics at work.

She still goes to the water management facility three days a week—maintaining systems that might not matter in fourteen years but matter now. The numbers are stark: global fertility rate dropped 87% in the first three months after detection. Pregnancies terminated. Couples stop trying.

Why bring a child into a world that's ending?

Zara understands the logic.

But three months after detection, she tells Kwame she wants another baby.

They're in bed, Maya finally asleep after an hour of questions. *Why is the sky different? Why do people cry? Why did Auntie Amara stop visiting?*

"I want to have another child," Zara says into the darkness.

Kwame is silent. Then: "What?"

"I want another baby. Before it's too late."

He sits up, turns on the light. Looks at her like she's lost her mind. "Zara. The world is ending. In fifteen years, everyone dies. Including Maya. You want to bring another child into that?"

"Yes."

"Why? So they can die even younger?"

Zara sits up too. She's been thinking about this for weeks. Since her conversation with Professor Wei, the old woman's words echoing: *Do flowers not bloom in autumn?*

"Because I'm thirty-four years old. Because I have maybe four more years where I can safely carry a child. Because life creates life—that's what it does." Her voice breaks. "Because Maya will die at seventeen. And I can't stop that. But I can give her a sibling. I can fill the house with life instead of waiting for death."

"That's not fair to the child."

"Is fifteen years of life worse than no life? Is it more cruel to exist briefly than never exist?"

Kwame runs his hands over his face. "I don't know. I don't know what's cruel anymore."

"Exactly. Nothing means what it used to mean. So we get to choose what it means now. And I choose life. I choose defiance." She takes his hand. "Even though the world is ending, we're not done yet."

"People will think we're crazy."

"People already think we're crazy for not—" Several neighbors have already died by suicide. Others fled, trying to outrun what can't be outrun. "Everyone's handling this differently. This is how I want to handle it. By creating instead of destroying."

Kwame looks at her for a long time. She sees the war in his eyes. Fear and hope. Resignation and defiance.

Finally, he nods. "Okay. If this is what you need. If this is how you survive this. Then okay."

They conceive two weeks later.

###

At home, David is cooking dinner.

He still does this—maintains routines, performs small acts of normal life. Dinner at 7pm. Cleaning on Saturdays.

Amara comes home at 10pm. The dinner is cold. David is in bed, not sleeping, staring at the ceiling.

She sits on the edge of the bed. "I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"Being late. Again."

"It's okay."

"It's not okay."

David rolls over to look at her. His face is tired. They're both tired. "Are you still looking for a solution?"

"No. There is no solution. I'm just... monitoring. Tracking. Updating the calculations."

"Why?"

She doesn't have an answer. Why does she keep working when the work is meaningless? What's the point of tracking an asteroid you can't stop?

"I don't know," she admits.

They lie in silence. She can feel the space between them—physical and emotional. They're married, but barely. They sleep in the same bed but don't touch.

She wants to reach for him. But she's so tired, and she has to be back at the facility by 6am.

"Goodnight," she says.

"Goodnight," David replies.

Neither of them sleeps much.

###

The pregnancy is controversial.

Zara's colleagues whisper. One woman—older, no children—confronts her directly at the facility.

"How can you do that? Bring a child into this? It's cruel."

"Crueler than dying childless in fifteen years?" Zara shoots back. "Crueler than spending our last years with nothing to live for?"

"You have Maya."

"And now I'll have two children. Two reasons to get up every morning. You think that's cruel? I think it's human."

The woman walks away shaking her head.

Professor Wei, on the other hand, is delighted.

"You're pregnant!" The old woman's face lights up when Zara tells her. They're in Wei's garden—Maya playing with the lemon tree, Zara's hand on her barely-showing belly.

"You think I'm crazy too."

"No. I think you're brave. It would be easier to give up. To stop creating. To wait for death quietly. But you're choosing life. Even temporary life. Even doomed life. That's extraordinary."

"Everyone else thinks I'm selfish."

"You are selfish. In the best way. You're insisting on your own meaning, your own choice, even when the universe says none of it matters. That's what it means to be human."

Zara starts crying. Pregnancy hormones, grief, relief—she doesn't know anymore.

"This child will die young," Wei says gently. "Maya will die young. You know this. But you'll have fifteen years of love. That's not nothing."

"Everyone keeps saying that. 'It's not nothing.' But it's not much either."

"Hope was always temporary. We just pretended it was permanent. Your children will live fifteen years of presence. Most humans live eighty years and never fully wake up. Your children will be awake for every moment they have. That's a gift, Zara. A terrible, beautiful gift."

###

Six months after her final report, Amara sits alone in the monitoring facility at 2am.

The screens glow. Trajectory data. Impact projections. Countdown timers.

13 years, 6 months, 17 days.

She realizes she's wasted six months. Six of her fifteen years, spent calculating things that don't need calculating. Tracking an asteroid that cannot be stopped.

She realizes she's losing David. Maybe has already lost him.

She realizes her sister is raising two children in Lagos and Amara hasn't visited once. Hasn't met her nephew in person.

She realizes she's spent six months preparing for death and zero time learning how to live with it.

The realization sits in her chest, heavy and painful.

She should leave. Should go home. Should find David and apologize and reconnect.

Instead, she pulls up the trajectory calculations and checks them again. The forty-thousandth time, maybe. Or more.

Because stopping would mean facing everything she's been avoiding.

And she's not ready yet.

###

Kofi is born six months after detection. Year 2.

The delivery is straightforward—Zara's second birth, her body knows what to do. Kwame is there. Maya stays with Professor Wei during labor, then comes to meet her brother.

The three-year-old stares at the infant in wonder. "He's so small!"

"You were small once too," Zara says, exhausted and elated.

Maya reaches out carefully. Kofi's tiny fingers curl around hers. "He's holding me!"

Zara watches her daughter's face. Joy, pure and uncomplicated. Not thinking about fifteen years. Just: present, delighted, in love with her baby brother.

This is what Zara wanted. This moment. This connection. This life.

The nurse is professional but cool. Disapproving, maybe.

"Congratulations," she says, but it sounds hollow.

Zara doesn't care. She's holding her son. Maya is holding his hand. Kwame is crying happy tears.

They have a family. A growing family. In a dying world.

It's absurd and perfect.

###

Three months later, Maya asks the question Zara has been dreading.

They're in the living room. Kofi on his play mat. Maya building with blocks.

"Mama, when I'm big, will I hold babies like you hold Kofi?"

Zara's hands freeze.

Will Maya be a mother? Hold babies? Grow up?

No. No. No.

Maya will die at seventeen. Will never be a mother. Will never grow up at all.

But Zara can't say that. Can't put that knowledge on a three-year-old.

So she lies.

"Yes, sweetheart. When you're big, you can hold babies."

Maya smiles and goes back to her blocks.

Zara finishes her task. Puts Kofi down for a nap. Checks that Maya is occupied.

Then she goes to the bathroom, locks the door, and collapses on the floor.

The sobs come hard and silent. She bites her hand to keep from making noise.

Her daughter will never hold babies. Will never be big. Will never grow up.

But she's alive now. Building block towers. Loving her baby brother. Experiencing joy.

That has to be enough.

###

One year after detection, the monitoring facility is mostly empty.

Half the staff quit in the first six months. Another quarter died—suicides mostly, though some accidents, some violence. The remainder work sporadic shifts.

Amara still comes every day. Still sits at her station. Still updates calculations that don't need updating.

Her sister calls. "Amara. You need to come visit. Meet your nephew. Kofi is six months old. Maya asks about you all the time."

"I'm working."

"Working on what? You said yourself there's no solution."

"Monitoring. Tracking. Someone needs to maintain the systems."

"The systems are automated."

"Someone needs to oversee them."

"Amara." Zara's voice is patient but firm. "You're hiding. You're using work to avoid feeling this. Come to Lagos. Be with family. Please."

"I can't. Not yet."

"When?"

"I don't know."

After the call, Amara sits in the empty facility. Around her, screens show the asteroid's trajectory. Constant. Precise. Unavoidable.

She pulls up the impact simulation. Watches the asteroid strike the Pacific. Watches the fireball expand. Watches humanity end.

She's watched this simulation hundreds of times.

She knows exactly how she'll die. Exactly when. Exactly why.

Does that make it better or worse?

She runs the simulation again.

###

Two years after detection, David stops coming home some nights.

Not infidelity—Amara would almost prefer that. He sleeps at the maintenance facility. Or on the solar platforms.

They're still married. Still living together technically. But they're not together.

They're two people drowning separately, too exhausted to reach for each other.

Amara works sixteen-hour days. David works his own long shifts. When they're home together, they move around each other like ghosts. Polite. Distant. Careful not to touch.

She knows she's losing him. Knows she's choosing work over marriage.

But she can't stop.

The calculations are all she has. The only thing that makes sense. Numbers don't lie. Numbers don't feel. Numbers don't ask why.

If she stops, she'll have to feel everything she's been avoiding for two years.

She's not ready.

So she keeps working. Keeps updating coordinates.

13 years left.

Then 12 years, 11 months.

The countdown continues. She continues with it.

David continues separately.

And the space between them grows.

###

Six months after Kofi's birth, Amara finally calls.

They haven't spoken in months. Zara has stopped trying—her sister needs space, apparently. Space to waste her life on equations that don't matter.

But today, Amara calls.

"I heard you had the baby."

"Six months ago. His name is Kofi."

"I'm sorry I didn't—" Amara stops. Starts again. "Congratulations."

"Are you congratulating me or judging me? Because half the world thinks I'm a monster for having him."

Silence. Then: "I don't know what I think. I don't know what anything means anymore. But if you wanted another child, I'm... I'm glad you have him. I guess."

It's not much. But it's something.

"How are you?" Zara asks.

"Working. Tracking. The same."

"Amara, there's no solution. You said so yourself. Why are you still—"

"I don't know. I don't know why I'm still working. I just... I keep going."

Zara hears the exhaustion in her sister's voice. The emptiness. "You should come visit. Meet Kofi. See Maya. She asks about you."

"I can't. Not yet. Too much work."

"Work that doesn't matter."

"I know."

"Then come anyway."

"I can't."

After the call ends, Zara holds Kofi and cries. Her sister is wasting the time they have left. Hiding behind work. Pushing away everyone who loves her.

But Zara can't fix her. Can't force her to live differently.

All Zara can do is love her own family. Raise her children. Choose life every day.

Even when it feels impossible.

###

One year after Kofi's birth, Zara takes both children to Professor Wei's garden.

Maya is four now. Kofi is learning to walk, stumbling on chubby legs. Wei is one hundred sixteen, frailer but still sharp.

The old woman watches Kofi toddle toward the lemon tree. "He's beautiful."

"Thank you."

"And you? How are you managing?"

"Some days I'm okay. Some days I can't breathe from grief. But I keep going. For them." Zara watches Maya help Kofi reach a low-hanging lemon. "Was I wrong to have him?"

"There is no wrong or right anymore. Only choices. You chose life. Someone else might choose differently. Neither is incorrect."

"But he'll die so young. Fourteen."

"And Maya will die at seventeen. And you and Kwame in your fifties. And I'll die soon if my body holds out. We're all dying young now, Zara. The asteroid took away old age. But it didn't take away childhood. Kofi gets to be a child. That's real. That matters."

Maya comes running over. "Mama! Kofi picked a lemon!"

Kofi toddles after his sister, lemon clutched in his fist, face proud.

Zara watches them. Her children. Her impossible, doomed, precious children.

"I love them so much it hurts," she whispers.

"I know," Wei says. "That's what love is when you know it's temporary. It's always been temporary. You're just awake to it now."

"Will it get easier?"

"No. But you'll get stronger. You'll learn to hold the joy and the grief simultaneously. You'll teach them how to live, not just how to die. That's your work now."

Maya and Kofi are laughing, chasing each other. Kofi falls down, Maya helps him up. The simple, ordinary magic of children playing.

Fourteen years left. Thirteen years left. Time running out.

But right now, in this moment, they're alive.

They're here.

And Zara chose that.

She'll never regret it.

Even when it breaks her heart.

Especially then.
