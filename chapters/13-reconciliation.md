# Chapter 13 - Reconciliation

David Chen is calibrating platform seventy-three when Amara appears on the maintenance deck.

He doesn't notice her at first—too focused on the connection housing, checking voltage regularity, updating the log. The arrays need maintenance. They always need maintenance. That's what he does. That's all he does.

"David."

He freezes. Turns slowly. Amara stands at the deck railing, two hundred meters above the ice shelf, wearing the thermal coat she never wears, looking uncomfortable at this height, looking at him.

Year 10. Five years until impact. They've been married twelve years. Strangers for the last decade.

"Amara." His voice sounds rusty. When did they last talk? Really talk, not just logistics about the apartment or brief messages about schedules. "What are you doing up here?"

"Looking for you."

"I'm working."

"I know. You're always working." She moves closer—carefully, not comfortable on the platform. "Can we talk?"

"I'm in the middle of—"

"Please."

Something in her voice stops him. Not desperation exactly. Not demand. Just: truth. She needs to talk. Needs him to listen.

David sets down his tools. "Okay."

###

The monitoring facility is a tomb.

Amara sits at her workstation, staring at screens that show the same data they've shown for ten years: trajectory confirmed, impact inevitable, countdown precise. Year 10. Five years remaining. 1,826 days until extinction.

She's been tracking this asteroid for a decade. Calculated every variable. Explored every impossible solution. Wasted every moment.

The facility used to house sixty scientists. Now: three. Chen works the night shift. Rodriguez quit last month. Just Amara, alone in the vast empty space, updating calculations that don't need updating.

She's been hiding here for ten years.

Today, she stops.

Amara closes the monitoring programs. Shuts down her workstation. Walks out of the facility for the last time.

The Antarctic morning is bright—polar summer, sun circling endlessly. The cold air hits her face like truth. Sharp. Undeniable. Real.

She pulls out her comm unit. Finds David's contact. Stares at it for five minutes.

They've been married twelve years. Strangers for ten of them. She knows his schedule—he's at the solar arrays, maintaining systems with robots who are better colleagues than humans. She knows he comes home late, avoids the apartment, avoids her.

She knows because she's been doing the same thing.

Different hiding places. Same death.

Amara calls him.

"Chen here," David's voice, flat and automatic.

"David. It's Amara."

Pause. "Is something wrong?"

"Yes. Everything. But I want to fix it."

"What do you mean?"

"I'm coming to the arrays. I need to talk to you. Please."

Another pause. "I'm at platform seventy-three."

"I'll find it."

She disconnects before she loses courage.

###

They stand on the platform, wind whipping around them, solar panels stretching in perfect rows, the sun circling the horizon. Below, the megacity functions. Above, nothing but sky and the asteroid coming.

"We wasted ten years," Amara says.

The words land like stones. Direct. Undeniable.

"I know," David says quietly.

"I wasted them in the monitoring facility, tracking calculations that don't matter. You wasted them here, maintaining arrays for no one. We both just... hid. From each other. From everything."

"Yes."

"And I don't want to waste five more." Amara's voice cracks. "I don't want to die estranged. I don't want our marriage to end like this—two ghosts in the same apartment, polite and distant and dead already."

David looks at his wife. Really looks. She's fifty years old. Gaunt. Exhausted. Older than she should be. But still: Amara. Still the woman he fell in love with fifteen years ago, the scientist who saw patterns in chaos, the brilliant mind that matched his, the person he chose to build a life with.

Before the life ended.

Before they stopped trying.

"What are you saying?" he asks.

"I'm saying I'm sorry. I'm saying I was wrong to hide in work. I'm saying you deserve better than a ghost for a wife. I'm saying..." She breathes deeply. "I'm saying I love you. Still. Maybe always. And I want to try. For five years. I want to actually be married instead of just cohabiting. I want to know you again. I want—"

Her voice breaks. She wipes her eyes quickly, frustrated with herself.

David doesn't know what to say. For ten years, he's functioned. Maintained arrays. Worked alongside robots who don't need meaning. He's forgotten how to connect. How to reach for someone. How to be anything except mechanical.

But standing on the platform, wind cold, Amara crying, five years stretching ahead—he realizes something: he doesn't want to die alone either.

Doesn't want to die estranged.

Doesn't want their marriage to end as ghosts.

"Okay," he says.

"Okay?"

"Let's try."

Amara stares at him. "Just like that?"

"Not just like that. It's... I've been thinking about it too. About us. About how we're wasting what's left." He gestures at the arrays. "The robots are better at this than I am. They don't need me. But you... maybe you need me. Maybe I need you."

"I do need you," Amara says. "I need us."

David moves closer—awkward, uncertain. He hasn't touched his wife in years. Doesn't remember how. But he reaches out, takes her hand.

She squeezes back. Hard. Holding on.

They stand there, two hundred meters up, holding hands like teenagers, like the beginning, like before everything fell apart.

"I don't know how to do this," David says. "I don't know how to be... not mechanical."

"Neither do I. But we figure it out. Together. One day at a time."

"One day at a time," he echoes.

###

They start with coffee.

David comes home after his shift—actually comes home at reasonable hour, doesn't extend into sixteen-hour marathons. Amara makes coffee—real coffee, synthesized but decent. They sit at the kitchen table.

"How was your day?" Amara asks.

The question feels alien. When did they last ask each other that? Year 2? Year 3?

"Platform seventy-three needed recalibration," David says. "Voltage deviation. Fixed it."

"That's good."

Silence. Awkward, heavy.

"How was yours?" David asks.

"Empty. The monitoring facility is down to three people. We're tracking approach vectors that don't change. It's pointless. But I don't know what else to do."

"You could stop. Come work with me. The arrays need maintenance."

Amara considers. "Would that be better? Or just different pointless work?"

"At least we'd be doing pointless work together."

She smiles—small, genuine, first smile he's seen in years. "That's actually appealing."

They drink coffee. Talk haltingly. Stop. Start again. It's like learning a language they used to speak fluently, forgotten grammar, missing vocabulary.

But they keep trying.

###

Learning to be present is harder than solving physics problems.

Amara has spent her life in her mind—calculating, analyzing, problem-solving. When detection happened, she doubled down: if she could just think hard enough, work long enough, calculate precisely enough, she could find a solution.

Ten years proved her wrong.

There is no solution. There never was.

So now: presence. Being here. With David. In the moment.

It's terrifying.

###

The next morning, Amara joins David at the arrays. She's not trained for maintenance work, but she learns quickly—she's brilliant, always was. David shows her how to check connections, recalibrate sensors, update logs. They work side by side.

47B glides along its rail, sensor array rotating. *Query: additional human detected. Maintenance efficiency parameters adjusting.*

"This is 47B," David says. "My... colleague."

"You've mentioned it. The robot you talk to."

"Yeah."

Amara studies the robot. "Does it talk back?"

"Not really. But it listens better than humans."

"That's depressing."

"I know."

They work through the morning. Amara's good at it—precise, methodical, careful. She doesn't complain about the cold or the height or the meaninglessness. She just: works.

At lunch, they sit on the platform, eating synthesized protein bars, watching the ice shelf stretch endlessly.

"I talked to Zara yesterday," Amara says. "She wants to visit Year 15. Bring Kwame and the children. She wants us to meet them properly."

David nods. "I'd like that."

"Really?"

"I'd like to meet your family. I'd like to be part of your life again."

Amara leans against him—tentatively, testing if touch is allowed. David puts his arm around her. Awkward. Uncertain. But: connection.

They sit there for twenty minutes. Not talking. Just: being together.

It's the most present David's felt in a decade.

###

Week two of trying, they walk in the nature preserves.

Antarctica maintains them still—small zones of transplanted ecosystems, trees and grass and flowing water, maintained for beauty's sake even though beauty's ending. The preserves are mostly empty now.

David and Amara walk the paths. She tells him about her work—ten years of tracking the asteroid, calculating impact vectors, searching for solutions that don't exist. The desperation. The futility. The slow realization that she was hiding.

"I couldn't face what was coming," she says. "If I kept working, kept calculating, I could pretend there was something to do. But there was never anything to do. And I wasted ten years pretending."

"I did the same," David says. "The arrays don't need this much maintenance. I was just... finding excuses to stay away from the apartment. From you. From feeling anything."

"Why?"

"Because feeling hurt. Because connection meant loss. Because if I let myself care, I'd have to face that we're dying. All of us."

They walk in silence. The preserve stretches around them—green and alive and temporary.

"My sister was right," Amara says. "She told me I was hiding. She chose to have a second child after detection—everyone said she was cruel. But she was brave. She saw what mattered and chose it. I saw what mattered and ran from it."

"What matters?" David asks.

"This. You. Us. Connection. Love." Amara stops walking, faces him. "We're dying, David. We have five years. Maybe less if the infrastructure collapses. I don't want to waste them. I want every moment with you. I want to actually be married. I want—"

She's crying. David pulls her close. She holds him like she's drowning, like he's the only solid thing in a collapsing world.

Maybe he is.

Maybe she is for him.

"I'm sorry," he whispers. "I'm sorry I gave up on us."

"I gave up too. We both did."

"But we're trying now."

"Yes. We're trying now."

They stand in the preserve, holding each other, two people who forgot how to connect learning to remember. It's not romantic. Not dramatic. Just: human. Just: necessary.

Just: love.

###

Month two of trying, Kenji Torres shows up at their apartment.

Amara answers the door and stares. Her former student. Elena's son. The brilliant physics mind who dropped out after detection, ran away seeking meaning.

"Kenji?"

"Amara. Hi." He looks different—quieter, more present, less frantically seeking. "I came to see you. And my mother. I'm back in Antarctica."

"Come in. Coffee?"

They sit in the small kitchen—teacher and student reunited after nine years. David joins them, curious.

Kenji tells them about his journey. Tokyo's pleasure districts. Buddhist temples. Hindu ashrams. Jerusalem's conflicts. Meeting Ibrahim, the fighter losing faith. Lagos with Professor Wei—the old philosophy professor who taught him impermanence through dying gardenias.

"She died last year," Kenji says. "Natural death, age 119. She was ready. I wasn't. But she taught me... being present matters more than finding answers. Presence is the answer."

Amara listens, and something shifts in her chest. Kenji left because she couldn't give him answers about meaning. He sought everywhere. Found a teacher who admitted she had no answers—just presence.

And now he's back. Quiet. Clear. At peace.

"I'm proud of you," Amara says.

"For what?"

"For seeking. For finding. For coming home." She reaches across, squeezes his hand. "I spent ten years trying to solve the unsolvable. You spent nine years seeking the unseekable. We both failed. But you learned to stop. I'm just learning now."

"You're learning with David," Kenji observes. "I can see it. You're different. Both of you."

"We're trying," David says.

"That's everything," Kenji says. "Trying is everything."

###

Month three, Zara calls.

Amara's sister appears on the video screen—beautiful, tired, alive. Behind her, children play. Maya, nine years old. Kofi, six. Both laughing, both temporary, both impossibly precious.

"Amara!" Zara's face lights up. "I miss you."

"I miss you too." Amara's throat tightens. "Your children are getting so big."

"I know. Maya's already asking questions I can't answer. Kofi still thinks we have forever." Zara smiles, sad and warm. "I'm coming to Antarctica. Year 15. Few months before... before. I want you to meet them properly. I want us to be together at the end."

"I'd like that. I'd like that so much."

"How are you? How's David?"

"We're... we're trying. We wasted ten years, Zara. I wasted ten years hiding from everything. But we're trying now."

Zara's eyes fill with tears. "I'm so glad. I told you—you were hiding. I'm glad you stopped."

"You were right. You chose life. I chose escape. But I'm choosing differently now."

"That's all we can do. Choose differently. Choose better." Zara glances at her children. "Maya! Kofi! Come say hi to Aunt Amara!"

The children tumble into view. Maya, serious and thoughtful. Kofi, energetic and curious. They wave at the screen.

"Hi Aunt Amara!" Maya says. "Mama says we're visiting you in Antarctica!"

"I can't wait to meet you properly," Amara says.

"Are you a scientist?" Maya asks.

"Yes. I study space."

"Like asteroids?"

Zara winces. Amara meets her sister's eyes, then looks at Maya. "Yes. Like asteroids."

"Cool! I want to be a scientist too!"

Amara's chest tightens. Maya wants to be a scientist. Maya won't live long enough to be a scientist. Maya has six years left.

But Zara doesn't correct her. Doesn't remind her. Just smiles and says, "You'll be a great scientist."

After the call ends, Amara sits staring at the blank screen.

"You okay?" David asks.

"She's nine. She wants to be a scientist. She'll never—" Amara's voice breaks. "How does Zara do it? How does she love them knowing they're dying?"

"Same way we're loving each other," David says quietly. "Knowing doesn't make love wrong. Makes it more important."

Amara turns to him. This man she married. This man she abandoned. This man who waited, who's trying again, who's teaching her presence through his steady quiet existence.

"I love you," she says. "I always loved you. I'm sorry I disappeared."

"You're here now."

"I'm here now."

She kisses him. They move to the bedroom. Make love for the first time in a decade—awkward, emotional, real. Everything she forgot bodies could be—vulnerable, present, alive.

After, lying tangled together, Amara cries. Not sad exactly. Just: feeling everything. The ten years wasted. The five years remaining. The love that persisted. The connection restored.

"We don't have enough time," she whispers.

"We have what we have," David says.

"Five years."

"Five years to love. Five years to be present. Five years to do it right."

"Think that's enough?"

"I don't know. But it's ours."

###

Month three of trying, David realizes something: he's happy.

Not constantly. Not perfectly. But: present. Connected. Alive in ways he forgot were possible.

He still maintains the arrays—that's his work, his function. But now Amara works beside him. They talk while they work. Share observations. Solve problems together.

At home, they cook together. Clean together. Sleep in the same bed—not just proximity anymore, but intimacy rebuilding steadily.

One night, lying in the dark, Amara says, "I was so angry at you for giving up."

"I know."

"But I gave up too. I gave up on us. On connection. On everything except calculations that didn't matter."

"Why did you reach out?" David asks. "After ten years, why now?"

"Zara. She video called, showed me her children. They were so happy. Living fully despite knowing they're dying. And I realized—I'm dying too, but I'm not living. I'm already dead. We're already dead. And I didn't want that anymore."

David turns to face her in the dark. "I'm glad you reached out."

"Are you?"

"Yes. I forgot how much I love you. I forgot what connection feels like. You reminded me."

###

Year 10 becomes Year 11. Four years left.

David and Amara work the arrays together. They're efficient—better than David alone, better than David with robots. They know each other's rhythms, anticipate movements, function as unit.

But they're not mechanical. They talk. Laugh sometimes. Share silence.

One afternoon, Kenji visits the arrays. "Amara," he says. "You look... different."

"Happy," Amara says. "I look happy."

"Yes. That." Kenji smiles. "I'm glad."

When he leaves, Amara says, "He's wiser than I was at his age. Maybe wiser than I am now."

"You're learning," David says. "We both are."

"Learning what?"

"How to be alive. How to be together. How to make time matter."

She takes his hand. They stand on the platform, two hundred meters up, four years left, holding on.

"I love you," Amara says.

"I love you too."

Simple. True. Enough.

###

One evening, they sit in the preserve watching the transplanted trees move in Antarctic wind.

"Zara's confirmed for Year 15," Amara says. "She'll bring Kwame and the children. Maya will be seventeen. Kofi thirteen."

"I'm nervous to meet them."

"Why?"

"Because I wasted ten years. Because I was a ghost when I should have been your husband. Because they're going to see what a failure I was."

Amara squeezes his hand. "You're not a failure. You're human. You struggled. You survived. You're trying now. That's all anyone can do."

"Think that's enough?"

"I think it's everything."

They watch the trees. David realizes: she's right. He failed. They both did. But they're trying now. They're present now. They're alive now.

Four years until impact.

Four years to be married.

Four years to love fully.

Four years to be human.

It's not enough time.

But it's what they have.

And maybe—maybe—that's everything.

"Thank you," David says quietly.

"For what?"

"For not giving up. For reaching out. For giving us a second chance."

"Thank you for saying yes. For trying. For being here."

###

Amara curls against him. Her brilliant mind—trained to calculate, analyze, solve—finally quiet. Not because she found answers. Because she stopped needing them.

The asteroid is coming. She knows the exact trajectory. Knows the impact point. Knows the physics of extinction.

But right now, lying with David, feeling his heartbeat, breathing his breath—the knowledge doesn't matter.

This matters.

Being here matters.

Love matters.

Everything else is calculation.

And she's done calculating.

The monitoring facility sends automated requests: come back, we need you, the data requires analysis.

She ignores them.

The asteroid doesn't need her analysis. It's coming regardless. The only thing that needs her is David. And herself. And presence.

She's learning.

###

One evening, walking in the preserve, David says, "We don't have enough time."

"We have what we have," Amara says.

"Four years."

"Four years to love. Four years to be present. Four years to live before dying."

They stand together, holding hands, two people who were ghosts becoming human again.

It's not perfect. They fight sometimes. Struggle. Face hard moments.

But they face them together.

And together—finally, impossibly, gratefully—is enough.

The robots maintain. The arrays function. The systems operate.

And David and Amara—after ten years of dying—finally start living.

Together.

At last.

Four years of ordinary.

Four years of coffee mornings and array maintenance and preserve walks and tangled sleeping and just: being together.

Four years to love.

Four years to be present.

Four years to live.

Not enough.

But everything.

Always everything.

Outside, the asteroid approaches. Inside, Amara stops calculating and starts living.

Finally.

At last.

With David beside her.

With time enough to matter.

With love enough to be real.

With presence enough to be everything.

Amara Okafor—brilliant scientist, problem-solver, analyst—learns the only thing that matters:

Being here.

Being present.

Being alive.

Being human.

Being loved.

Being.

Just: being.

For four years.

Starting now.
