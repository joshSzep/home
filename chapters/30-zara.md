# Chapter 30: Zara

Wei's body is still warm when Zara realizes she has to tell someone.

The children sit on the floor beside the bed—Maya fourteen, Kofi eleven, both crying quietly, both staring at their grandmother who was alive this morning and isn't now. Kwame stands in the doorway, present but giving them space, letting them grieve.

Year 12. Three years until the asteroid. 126 years since Wei's birth. Hours since her death.

Individual death. Natural death. The kind that used to be the only kind.

Zara's hands shake as she pulls out her comm unit. Who to call first? Kenji—he'll want to know. Elena—she corresponded with Wei. The neighbors who knew her. The students scattered across the dying world.

She starts with Kenji.

The connection takes minutes to establish—networks failing, distance vast. Finally, his face appears on the screen. He's in Antarctica, morning there, and he smiles when he sees her.

Then sees her face.

"Zara? What happened?"

"Professor Wei died. This morning. Peacefully. She was ready."

Kenji's face crumples. "No. No, I was going to—I wanted to—"

"I know. I'm sorry. She went peacefully. The children were with her. She said to tell you: the flower bloomed. She said you'd understand."

Kenji is crying. Thirty-six years old, transformed by this woman's teaching, and crying like a child who lost his grandmother.

"I do understand," he says. "Tell her—tell Maya and Kofi—I'm honoring her from here. I can't come for the funeral, but I'm honoring her."

"I will. She loved you, Kenji. She was so proud of you."

"I loved her too."

They disconnect. Zara calls Elena next, then others. Each call the same—shock, grief, gratitude that Wei died naturally, peacefully, before the asteroid forced everyone into collective death.

Individual death is mercy. Zara didn't understand that before. Now she does.

Wei chose her witnesses. Had her goodbyes. Died surrounded by love.

In three years, no one will have that. Everyone will die together, violently, without choice.

Wei escaped. Individual death is escape.

The funeral is two days later.

Lagos has a crematorium—one of the few still functioning. Zara brings Wei's body there, wrapped in white cloth, light as autumn leaves. The children come. Kwame. A dozen neighbors. Three former students who still live in Lagos. No one else—travel is impossible now, systems failing, the world contracting to localities.

They gather in the small ceremony room. No priest—Wei wasn't religious. No formal service—Wei didn't want one. Just: people who loved her, witnessing her departure.

Zara speaks because someone has to. She stands before Wei's wrapped body, looking at faces she knows, and says:

"Professor Wei taught us about impermanence. She said everything blooms and fades. She said meaning isn't in lasting but in being. She said the asteroid doesn't change this—life was always temporary." Zara's voice breaks. Steadies. "She lived 126 years. She taught for seventy. She loved freely and died ready. That's everything. That's all we can hope for."

Maya stands next. Fourteen years old, too young for this, too old to avoid it.

"Grandmother Wei told me to be present. Even when afraid. She said that's all that matters." Maya's voice is steady—too steady, holding back collapse. "I'm present now. I'm afraid now. She was right—it's all that matters."

Kofi can't speak. Just cries. That's okay. Crying is presence too.

The crematorium operator—efficient, professional, does this daily as the old die naturally before the asteroid takes everyone—activates the chamber. Wei's body slides into flame.

Bloom and fade.

Being and unbeing.

The natural cycle, accelerated by technology but fundamentally unchanged.

Afterward, Zara receives Wei's ashes in a simple ceramic urn. She brings them home. Places them in Wei's garden, under the lemon tree.

"Can we bury her here?" Maya asks.

"Yes. The garden was her place."

They dig together—Zara, Kwame, Maya, Kofi. Not deep. Just: enough. They place the urn in the earth. Cover it with soil. Plant flowers over it.

Wei becomes part of the garden she tended for decades. The lemon tree will drop fruit onto her remains. The flowers will bloom above her ashes. Life continuing, death feeding it, the cycle visible and true.

"Is she gone?" Kofi asks.

"Her body is gone," Zara says. "But what she taught us—that stays. What she showed us—that continues. She's gone and she's here. Both true at once."

"That doesn't make sense."

"I know. But it's true anyway."

---

That night, the children sleep in Zara's bed—curled together, needing closeness, first experience with loss. Kwame holds Zara in the dark.

"Are you okay?" he whispers.

"No. But I will be. She prepared me for this."

"How?"

"By being ready. By showing me that dying naturally, at the right time, is mercy. By teaching me to let go." Zara breathes slowly. "In three years, we don't get that. We don't get ready. We don't get peaceful. We just: end. All of us. Together."

"But we're together," Kwame says. "Wei died alone—peaceful, but alone. We'll have each other."

"Is that better? Or worse?"

"I don't know. Both, maybe. Different, definitely."

They lie in silence. The children breathe. Outside, Lagos breathes. Wei's garden grows in the dark, fed by her ashes, continuing without her.

"She said something before she died," Zara says. "About individual death and collective death. She said she dies alone, we die together. Neither is better. Both are death. Both are okay."

"Do you believe that?"

"I'm trying to."

"Me too."

---

Days pass. Zara returns to Wei's house. It's empty now—no frail body in the bed, no quiet presence in the garden, just: absence where a person used to be.

She finds Wei's papers. Decades of writings—philosophy papers, letters, journals. Some published, most not. Wei didn't write for publication. Wrote for clarity. For processing. For teaching.

Zara reads through them. Finds a letter addressed to her, written months ago:

*Zara,*

*If you're reading this, I'm dead. Good. I was ready.*

*Thank you for caring for me. For being my neighbor. For letting your children love me. You made my last years beautiful. That's everything.*

*Keep teaching Maya and Kofi. Show them impermanence isn't terrible—it's true. Show them beauty exists because it's brief. Show them love matters because it doesn't last.*

*You chose to have Kofi after detection. That was the bravest thing I've seen. You chose life knowing it's brief. That's wisdom. That's everything.*

*Don't grieve me long. I lived fully. I died ready. Grieve, yes—but then: live. For three more years. Live fully. Be present. Love fiercely. Show your children how.*

*The flower bloomed.*

*That's enough.*

*Mei-Lin Wei*

Zara reads it three times. Cries each time. Then folds it carefully. Keeps it.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.

Week later, Maya asks: "Will we be ready?"

They're in Wei's garden—Zara maintains it now, tending flowers that bloom over Wei's ashes. Maya helps, pulling weeds, watering plants. Kofi climbs the lemon tree despite being too old for climbing.

"Ready for what?" Zara asks, though she knows.

"To die. Like Grandmother Wei. She was ready. Will we be ready in three years?"

Zara sits back on her heels. Looks at her daughter—fourteen years old, carrying impossible weight, asking questions no child should ask.

"I don't know," Zara says honestly. "Wei was 126. She lived a full life. You'll be seventeen. That's not old enough to be ready. Neither is Kofi at fourteen. Neither is me at forty. We won't be ready."

"Then how do we do it?"

"Together. We don't do it ready. We just: do it together. Holding each other. Being present. Like Wei taught."

"But she was alone."

"She chose to be. Individual death is different—you get to choose witnesses, time, place. Collective death doesn't give us choices. But we have each other. That's something."

Maya is quiet. Then: "I'm scared."

"I know, baby. Me too."

"But you don't show it."

"I show it to Papa. And now to you. We can be scared together. Being scared is being present. Wei would approve."

They tend the garden. Kofi drops a lemon from the tree—ripe, yellow, perfect. They bring it inside. Make tea with it. Drink together.

"Grandmother Wei is in this lemon," Kofi says seriously.

"Yes," Zara agrees. "She is."

"That's weird."

"Yes. But true."

They drink tea made from lemons growing from Wei's ashes. Life continuing. Death feeding life. The cycle visible.

Month later, Zara makes a decision.

"We're going to Antarctica," she tells Kwame. "Year 15. Few months before impact. I want the children to see it. I want to be with Amara at the end. I want us together."

"Travel might be impossible by then."

"Then we leave earlier. Year 14. Give ourselves time. But we're going. Wei is gone. Lagos is dying. I want my children to see what humanity built. I want them to meet their aunt. I want—" Her voice breaks. "I want us together. All of us. When it happens."

"Okay," Kwame says simply. "We'll go."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that. We're together. That's all that matters. Lagos or Antarctica—doesn't matter where we die. Matters who we're with."

Zara pulls him close. Her husband. Her partner. Father of her children. They'll face the end together—watching their children die, dying themselves, holding each other through the impossible.

At least they choose this. At least they're together. At least it's love.

"Wei taught me to let go," Zara says. "I'm learning. Slowly. But learning."

"What are you letting go of?"

"The future. The idea that they'll grow up. The fantasy that this doesn't happen. All of it. Just: being here now. With you. With them. For three years. That's all. That's enough."

"Is it?"

"It has to be."

They hold each other. Outside, Wei's garden grows. Inside, children sleep. Around them, Lagos breathes its last years.

Three years left.

Three years to be present.

Three years to love fiercely.

Three years to bloom before fading.

Not enough.

But everything.

Wei proved that.

The flower bloomed.

Brief and perfect and true.

And when it faded, the garden continued.

Different, but continuing.

Loss and life, tangled together.

Both true at once.

Zara is learning.

Slowly.

But learning.

The children will learn too.

They already are.

Wei's last gift: teaching them death before Death comes.

Individual loss before collective loss.

Practice for the impossible.

Mercy wrapped in grief.

The flower bloomed.

Now they must bloom.

For three years.

Then fade.

Together.

Always together.

That's enough.

Has to be.

Wei said so.

And Wei was wise.

Right until the end.

The garden grows.

Life continues.

They bloom.

While they can.

Because they can.

That's everything.

Always was.

Wei knew it.

Now they know it too.

The flower bloomed.

That's enough.
